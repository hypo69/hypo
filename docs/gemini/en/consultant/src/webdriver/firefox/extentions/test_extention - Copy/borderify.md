# Changes Made

*   Added a module-level docstring in RST format, describing the module's purpose.
*   Added a function `set_border` to encapsulate the code for modifying the border.
*   Added a docstring to the `set_border` function, following RST format and explaining the parameters and return values.
*   Added a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during the execution.
*   Replaced `document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";` and `alert()` with a function call `set_border`
*   Added `logger.error` for error logging, following the instruction.
*   Included a placeholder for error handling within the `except` block.
*   Added comments to clarify the steps and the purpose of each section of the code.  # Replaced the alert with a function call
*   Added a placeholder `# ...` for further actions, such as logging details or returning appropriate values.
*   Added comments to indicate potential improvements in RST format using `TODO` notation.
