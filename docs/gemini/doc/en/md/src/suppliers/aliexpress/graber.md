# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for grabbing product data from AliExpress. It utilizes the `Graber` base class and interacts with the browser driver to extract product information.  The module employs asynchronous operations for efficiency and includes error handling for executing locators.  Global settings are managed through a `Context` class.

## Classes

### `Context`

**Description**:  A class for storing global configuration settings, such as the driver instance, locator object, and supplier prefix.

**Attributes**:

- `driver` (Driver): The browser driver instance.
- `locator` (SimpleNamespace): A namespace containing locators for various operations.
- `supplier_prefix` (str): Prefix for the supplier (e.g., 'aliexpress').


### `Graber`

**Description**:  A class for grabbing product information from AliExpress. It inherits from the `Grbr` class.


**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object with a driver instance and sets the `supplier_prefix`.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The browser driver instance.

**Raises**:
  - None explicitly stated


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: Asynchronous function to grab product fields.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The driver instance to use for grabbing.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: The grabbed product fields.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: If an error occurs during locator execution.



## Functions


## Global Variables


- `MODE` (str):  A global variable, likely representing the operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').


## Notes

The `close_pop_up` decorator is defined but commented out in the file.  The code includes a large number of placeholder `await` calls to functions for fetching various product details. These functions are not fully defined in the provided code snippet.  There's a significant amount of potential functionality not documented due to the extensive, but incomplete, `fetch_all_data` method.
