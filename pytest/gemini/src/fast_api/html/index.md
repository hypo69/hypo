```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Focus on JavaScript:** The original code was HTML with JavaScript.  The tests now focus on the JavaScript aspects.  Crucially, testing the AJAX part of the code *requires* interaction with a backend API.  Therefore, mocking is needed to test the *interaction*, which was missing before.

2. **Mock/Backend Integration:** You cannot fully test the `$.ajax` call without a backend API endpoint (`/process_data`).  To truly test the AJAX functionality, you need a way to simulate or directly call the endpoint.

3. **Data Formatting:**  The `test_data_format` checks the crucial JSON formatting step, which is a critical part of the AJAX communication.


**How to Extend These Tests:**

* **Backend Mock:** Create a mock of your backend endpoint (`/process_data`). This allows you to control the responses, including success and error conditions.  Use a mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`.

* **Backend Test:** Write tests for your backend function (`/process_data`) that handle the POST request.

* **Complete AJAX Test:** Combine the JavaScript AJAX test with the backend mock/tests to thoroughly verify that the JavaScript and backend work together correctly (sending and receiving data).

* **Error Handling:**  Implement tests that verify the `error` callback function in the AJAX call handles various error scenarios.

* **Data Validation:** Verify the backend appropriately handles incorrect input (e.g., missing fields, non-string values).


This improved structure provides a better starting point for robust JavaScript and API interaction testing.  Remember to adapt the `test_form_submit_handler` section based on how your backend endpoint works.  You cannot test the whole JavaScript and AJAX interaction from just HTML.
