## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/__init__.py

This file serves as an entry point for interacting with PrestaShop data. It imports various classes for accessing specific endpoints related to PrestaShop, allowing for structured data retrieval.

**Key Imports:**

* **`from .api import PrestaShop`**: Provides access to the core PrestaShop API functionality.  Likely for general store information, authentication, and potentially other high-level operations.

* **`from .product import PrestaProduct`**: Enables interactions with PrestaShop product data. This would likely include methods to retrieve product details, images, variations, etc.

* **`from .supplier import PrestaSupplier`**: Facilitates access to PrestaShop supplier information. Methods here might retrieve supplier details, contact information, or product associations.

* **`from .category import PrestaCategory`**: Offers interaction with PrestaShop categories.  Methods might handle retrieving category structures, associated products, or general category data.

* **`from .warehouse import PrestaWarehouse`**: Provides access to PrestaShop warehouse data. Methods might retrieve warehouse locations, stock levels, or other warehouse-specific attributes.

* **`from .language import PrestaLanguage`**: Handles interactions related to languages supported by PrestaShop. This could involve fetching language codes, names, or other language-related settings.

* **`from .shop import PrestaShopShop`**: Provides access to specific PrestaShop shops.  Likely to retrieve shop-specific settings, products, or other details relevant to a particular shop.

* **`from .pricelist import PriceListRequester`**: Enables access to PrestaShop pricelists.  This class may include methods to fetch, filter, or modify pricelists based on specific criteria (e.g., date range, product IDs).

* **`from .customer import PrestaCustomer`**: Provides access to PrestaShop customer data.  Methods might retrieve customer details, order history, or other relevant customer information.

**Usage Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop import PrestaShop, PrestaProduct, PrestaCategory

# Initialize the PrestaShop API client (replace with appropriate authentication)
prestashop_api = PrestaShop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", shop_id="YOUR_SHOP_ID")


# Retrieve product details for a specific product ID
product_id = 123
product = PrestaProduct(prestashop_api)
product_data = product.get_product(product_id)


# Retrieve all categories
categories = PrestaCategory(prestashop_api)
all_categories = categories.get_all_categories()

# Print the retrieved data
print(f"Product data: {product_data}")
print(f"Categories: {all_categories}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Authentication:** The example lacks authentication details.  You'll need to configure the `PrestaShop` object with appropriate credentials (API key, shop ID, or other authentication mechanisms) to interact with the PrestaShop API securely.

* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling (try...except blocks) to catch and manage potential exceptions (e.g., invalid API keys, network issues, incorrect data format).

* **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of the PrestaShop API's rate limits to avoid service disruptions. Implement appropriate delays or queuing strategies if necessary to respect the rate limits.

* **Documentation:**  Consult the API documentation of the specific PrestaShop version for detailed information about the available endpoints, methods, parameters, and data structures.  These details will be crucial for successful usage and will vary between versions.


This guide provides a starting point for working with the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/__init__.py` file.  Detailed usage of individual classes (e.g., `PrestaProduct`, `PrestaCategory`) requires referring to their respective module documentation.
