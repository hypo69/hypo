How to use the `emil_design.py` code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python script (`emil_design.py`) is designed for image design, description, and promotion across various platforms. It handles tasks like describing images using AI models (OpenAI), saving descriptions to a JSON file, and potentially uploading the descriptions and associated images to Facebook and PrestaShop.  The script utilizes several external modules, including `header`, `pathlib`, `time`, `gs`, `logger`, various API modules, and more.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
   - The script initializes the `EmilDesign` class, likely setting up necessary configurations and variables.  This includes defining base paths for storing instructions, examples, image files, and output data.

2. **Image Description (using AI):**
   - The `describe_images` method is called.  This method reads instructions and example data (likely text files).
   - It initializes an `OpenAIModel` with system instructions and an assistant ID.
   - It prompts the AI model to categorize images based on the provided instructions and examples.
   - It iterates through local image files, describing each using the AI model.  The description process considers whether to use image URLs or local file paths.
   - The generated descriptions (as JSON) are appended to the `data` list.
   - Successfully processed image paths are stored in `updated_images_list` to avoid redundant processing.
   - The processed image descriptions are saved to a JSON file.

3. **Facebook Promotion:**
   - The `promote_to_facebook` method is called, which is responsible for Facebook posting.
   - It first loads the generated image descriptions from the JSON file.
   - For each description, it creates a structured `SimpleNamespace` object for Facebook post parameters (title, description, and potentially attached images).
   - It calls the `post_message` function to actually post to Facebook.

4. **PrestaShop Upload:**
   - The `upload_to_PrestaShop` method prepares for product upload to PrestaShop.
   - It initializes a `Product` and a `PrestaShop` instance, suggesting these are necessary for PrestaShop integration.

5. **Main Execution Block:**
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is executed.
   - It creates an `EmilDesign` object and optionally calls the `describe_images`, `promote_to_facebook`, and/or `upload_to_PrestaShop` methods.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.emil.emil_design import EmilDesign

    # Create an instance of the EmilDesign class
    emil_design_instance = EmilDesign()

    # Describe images (replace with your image paths if needed)
    emil_design_instance.describe_images()

    # Promote images to Facebook
    emil_design_instance.promote_to_facebook()

    # Upload to PrestaShop (if required)
    emil_design_instance.upload_to_PrestaShop()


**Important Notes:**

*   This script requires the external modules and API implementations mentioned in the code (`header`, `gs`, `logger`, `PrestaShop`, `Driver`, `Chrome`, `GoogleGenerativeAI`, `OpenAIModel`, `Product`, `post_message`, `read_text_file`, `save_text_file`, `get_filenames`, `j_loads_ns`, `j_dumps`) to function correctly.
*   Ensure proper setup and configuration for the external services, including authentication where necessary (e.g., Facebook).
*   The placeholder `...` indicate sections of the code that are not fully shown but are important for complete execution.
*  The code utilizes the `SimpleNamespace` class for data structuring, which simplifies the process of accessing attributes of complex data.
*  The code uses `logger` extensively for logging information and debug messages.
