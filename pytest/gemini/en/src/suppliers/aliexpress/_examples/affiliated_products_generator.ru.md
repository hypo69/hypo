**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy `Product` Class:**  The provided code lacked a `Product` class.  This example creates a placeholder `Product` class.  Crucially, replace this with your actual `Product` class in your `affiliated_products_generator.py` if it exists.

2. **`parser_instance` Fixture:** This fixture simplifies testing by creating an instance of `AliAffiliatedProducts` once for each test.

3. **`product_urls` Fixture:** Similarly, this fixture sets up sample URLs for use across tests.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Tests now include:
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_valid_input`: Checks for valid input and ensures the output is a list.
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_empty_input`: Checks the case where the input is an empty list.
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_no_results`: This is importantâ€”tests for the case where `process_affiliate_products` returns an empty list.
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_url_type`: Tests for exception handling with wrong input types.
   - `test_product_attributes`: Checks if the returned `Product` objects actually have the expected attributes.
   - `test_product_attributes_optional_video`: Tests if the optional `local_saved_video` attribute is handled correctly, checking if it is `None`. 

5. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  The `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_url_type` demonstrates how to test for `TypeError`.

6. **Realistic Mocking:** The `test_process_affiliate_products_no_results` test provides an example of how to mock the situation where `process_affiliate_products` returns no results.  You'll need to tailor this to how your actual `AliAffiliatedProducts` handles empty results.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace `Product`:** Substitute the `Product` class with your actual `Product` class (if available) from `affiliated_products_generator.py`.
2. **Run Tests:**  Place these tests in a file (e.g., `test_affiliated_products.py`) and run them with pytest:
   ```bash
   pytest test_affiliated_products.py
   ```


This improved test suite covers more scenarios, making it more robust and reliable for testing your code. Remember to adapt the test cases to your actual code's functionality.  If the `Product` class doesn't exist yet, you can remove related test cases and adjust based on the API your `AliAffiliatedProducts` class exposes.
