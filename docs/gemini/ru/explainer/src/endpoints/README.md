Data Consumer Endpoints Module
=========================================================================================

The `endpoints` module provides an implementation of APIs for interacting with data consumers.
Each subdirectory represents a separate module that implements the API for a specific service.
The `endpoints` module includes submodules for integration with various consumer systems,
ensuring seamless interaction with external services.

## Module Structure


### Final Consumer Endpoints

#### 1. **PrestaShop**
Integration with the PrestaShop API, utilizing standard API features.

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

The diagram shows the relationships between the `src.endpoints` modules and other parts of the project, as well as external APIs.  The `endpoints` modules are responsible for interacting with external services (e.g., PrestaShop API, Emil API) to gather and process data from various consumer systems.  The `Main Application` utilizes the functions exported by the `endpoints` submodules.  The `External Services` group highlights the APIs that are being accessed by the `endpoints` modules.


## 4. <explanation>

The provided code is a README file, not Python code. It documents the structure and purpose of the `src.endpoints` module within the `hypo` project.

* **Imports:** There are no imports within the README file itself. The README describes the modules that *would* contain imports for APIs, if the project were to include the corresponding Python code.  Import statements are crucial for accessing functions from other modules.
* **Classes:** The README mentions classes like `PrestashopAPI` within modules such as `src.endpoints.prestashop`. These classes would encapsulate the logic for interacting with the PrestaShop API in Python.
* **Functions:**  Specific functions within the classes would handle tasks like making API calls, processing responses, and handling exceptions. The documentation describes the expected functionality of these functions.
* **Variables:** Variables would store API keys, URLs, and data retrieved from the APIs within the modules' implementations.  The README does not define variables or their types.
* **Possible Errors/Improvements:**  The README itself lacks executable code, so it's impossible to identify specific coding errors. The code, if properly implemented, should include error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) for API calls that might fail and proper logging for debugging and tracing requests.
* **Inter-project Dependencies:**  The `endpoints` module depends on external services (PrestaShop, various other APIs).  The implementation within the modules will need appropriate libraries (e.g., `requests`) for interacting with these services. The project also depends on a `requirements.txt` file to correctly manage dependencies.  The `requirements.txt` will list all Python libraries necessary to run the project.

**In summary:** The README file serves as a crucial documentation component, describing the overall organization and purpose of the `src.endpoints` module, highlighting the need for specific classes, functions, and dependencies to achieve desired functionality in the `hypo` project.
