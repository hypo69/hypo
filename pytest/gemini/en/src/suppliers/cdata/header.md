**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the test's purpose (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

2. **Mocking `__file__`:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` and `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file` tests now effectively mock `__file__` to simulate different scenarios. This ensures the tests don't rely on the presence of specific marker files and are isolated. Critically, this ensures the test accurately checks for *absence* of marker files.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Uses `pytest.raises` to correctly test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

4. **`temp_file` Fixture:** Added a `temp_file` fixture to help create temporary files, ensuring that the tests don't modify the actual project structure.

5. **Parametrization:** The `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file` now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with multiple invalid marker file names in a single test function, improving efficiency.

6. **Mocking `gs`:** The `test_settings_file_not_found` and `test_settings_json_decode_error` tests use `patch` from `unittest.mock` to effectively mock `gs.path.root` and check for proper exception handling. This isolates those parts of the code and prevents them from depending on actual files or paths.

7. **Handling `sys.path`:** The tests now correctly verify that `sys.path` is or is not modified as expected, according to the scenarios in the `set_project_root` function

8. **Import `sys`:** Added the necessary import statement `import sys` for use within tests, which was missing in the original example.


This revised solution provides more robust and accurate tests by focusing on the core functionality of `set_project_root` and includes tests for exception handling.  It is important to adjust the path constants (`MOCK_FILE` and the `gs.path.root` mock) if your actual project structure is different. Remember to replace `hypotez/src` with your actual package structure.


**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_header.py` (or `pytest` if your test file is in the root test directory).


This improved test suite will cover a wider range of scenarios and give you more confidence in the correctness of your code. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and project setup.
