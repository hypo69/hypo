## Notes

The included docstrings within the Python code (`"""..."""`) provide context for the components within this module, but they are not yet fully integrated into a complete documentation structure.  To create complete, useful documentation, the docstrings in any corresponding Python files should be expanded to include detailed explanations, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions according to the provided format.  For example, the docstrings currently are placeholders that describe what they are for, not how to use them.
