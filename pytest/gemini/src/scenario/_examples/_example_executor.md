**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added fixtures (`mock_supplier`, `mock_scenario_files`, `mock_scenario`, `mock_product_fields`, `mock_credentials`) to properly isolate test data from the test functions. This significantly improves test organization and readability.  Crucially, the `mock_*` fixtures now use the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names now clearly indicate the test's purpose (e.g., `test_run_scenario_files`).

3. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now cover various functions and edge cases more thoroughly, including `run_scenario_files`, `run_scenario_file`, `run_scenario`, `insert_grabbed_data`, `execute_PrestaShop_insert`, `add_coupon`, and `execute_PrestaShop_insert_async`.

4. **Exception Handling (Example):** Included a commented-out example of a test that uses `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`). Replace `mock_invalid_input` with the appropriate fixture for testing exceptions.

5. **Assertions:**  The added `assert result is not None` statements check for valid return values.  This is a very important addition, as the previous code had no assertions, making it difficult to tell if the functions were actually running correctly.  You'll need to add more specific assertions depending on what the `result` variable represents in each function.

6. **Mocking:** The mock classes (`MockSupplier`, `MockRelatedModules`, `MockDriver`) are crucial for testing the functions without relying on external dependencies like file access or network calls. This ensures that the tests run quickly and predictably.

7. **Data Fixtures:** The fixtures now create and return needed data (like scenarios) for the test functions to operate on.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_example_executor.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_example_executor.py`

**Crucial Next Steps:**

- **More Assertions:** The `assert result is not None` statements are placeholders. Replace these with more specific assertions based on what the functions are supposed to return.  For example, if `run_scenario_files` returns a list of results, you should assert that the returned list is of a specific length or contains specific values.
- **Realistic Test Data:**  The mock data is currently very simple. To write robust tests, provide more realistic scenarios and data in your fixtures that better represent how these functions will be used in the application.
- **Exception Handling:** Implement tests that validate exception handling (e.g., `pytest.raises`).
- **Dependencies:** Replace placeholder classes like `MockSupplier` with actual implementations, or define more mock functions in those classes to verify the interaction of each function's dependencies.


Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific behavior and requirements of your functions.  The provided examples cover the basic structure, and you must fill in the details to thoroughly test all aspects of the code. Remember to replace placeholders like `mock_invalid_input` with actual fixture for testing exceptions.
