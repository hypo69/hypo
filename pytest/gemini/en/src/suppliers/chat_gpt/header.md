```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.raises` for exceptions:**  The tests now correctly use `pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError)` to check for the expected `FileNotFoundError` when the file doesn't exist.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **`tmp_path` fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories for testing, avoiding conflicts and ensuring isolated tests.
* **Mock File Creation:**  The `mock_settings_json` fixture now properly creates the mock `settings.json` file in a temporary directory, removing the need to manually create files.
* **`monkeypatch` for `sys.path`:** The `monkeypatch` fixture is used to mock the `sys.path`  when testing the case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`.
* **Parameterization for testing different file not found scenarios:** The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to test cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD`  are not found (both valid scenarios).
* **Comprehensive tests:** The test cases now cover valid inputs, empty or missing files,  and various edge cases, making the test suite more robust.
* **Fixture for mock_readme_md:** A `mock_readme_md` fixture is created to similarly handle mock `README.MD` creation.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive test suite for the `set_project_root` function, demonstrating best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
