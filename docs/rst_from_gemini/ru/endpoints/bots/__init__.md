**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The original code didn't handle the case where the project root couldn't be found.  The `try...except` block now catches the `ValueError` raised by `get_project_root` and prints an informative error message,  then exits the script with an error code (1). This is crucial for robust code.
* **`return` from `get_project_root`:**  The function now explicitly `return`s the found `project_root`, avoiding potential issues with the `__root__` variable.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `project_root` instead of `__root__` within the function makes the code more readable and less confusing.
* **`sys.path` Insertion:** The `if project_root not in sys.path:` check is more appropriate and avoids potential redundancy.
* **Docstring improvement:** The `Returns` section in the docstring now includes the possible `ValueError` that may be raised (this is part of good practice in documenting errors).
* **`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__` Import:** The imports for `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `TelegramBot` are now in the correct location, and are correctly indented.


**Why these changes matter:**

- **Robustness:** The error handling makes the script more reliable in various scenarios.
- **Readability:** Using clear variable names and proper indentation makes the code easier to understand.
- **Correctness:** The code correctly finds the project root and handles cases where it cannot be found.
- **Pythonic Style:** The revised code adheres more closely to Python style guidelines (PEP 8).

**How to use the updated code:**

Make sure the `src` directory (including `gs.py` and `.version.py`) is in the `hypotez` project's `src` folder. Run the Python code from anywhere within the project directory. The code will now gracefully exit with an error if the project structure isn't valid.
