# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for scraping product data from WallaShop. It utilizes the `Graber` base class from the `src.suppliers` module and provides asynchronous methods for fetching various product fields.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**:  This class handles the data extraction process for WallaShop. It extends the base `Graber` class and manages the specific scraping logic for this supplier.

**Methods**

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object. Sets the `supplier_prefix` and initializes the base `Graber` class with the provided `driver`.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for interaction with the browser.


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: Asynchronous function to extract product fields from the WallaShop website.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: A `ProductFields` object containing the extracted product data.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: If an error occurs while executing a locator command.


## Functions

(No functions defined directly in this module, only methods in the Graber class.)


## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A string variable likely representing the current operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

### `d`

**Description**: A global variable, potentially a placeholder for the driver object.  It's used within the `grab_page` method and is likely meant to be assigned and used internally.



## Notes

- The code includes extensive commented-out sections that suggest various product fields could be extracted. This indicates a robust but incomplete implementation.
- The `close_pop_up` decorator, though defined, is commented out and not currently used in the module.
- The `fetch_all_data` function is asynchronous and is responsible for calling various other specific data extraction methods. It lacks a comprehensive description of how it handles errors.
