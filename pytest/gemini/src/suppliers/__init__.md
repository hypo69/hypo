**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Classes:** The code now includes placeholder classes `Supplier` and a dummy function.  This is crucial for testing.  Real testing requires the actual `Supplier` and `graber` classes.


2. **Specific Test Cases:** The test cases are now more specific, covering initialization, adding functions, and checking for appropriate types (in case of `add_function`).


3. **Exception Handling:**  `test_supplier_add_function_invalid_input` and `test_supplier_add_function_with_invalid_function` now demonstrate handling different types of incorrect input.  This is a key aspect of robust testing.


4. **Clear Assertions:** The assertions are more explicit about what's being checked.


5. **Realistic `pytest.raises`:**  The `pytest.raises` example is now more informative and checks for the correct error message, making the test more robust.


6. **Comprehensive `test_supplier_init`**: Now verifies the correct initialization.

7. **`test_mode_variable`:**  Checks the existence and type of the `MODE` variable. This is a crucial test to ensure this variable is set up correctly in the actual code and is not a potential source of issues.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Save:** Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_suppliers.py`) in a directory that's part of your Python path.  If you modify the file path to your modules in `sys.path`, make sure that path is correctly defined.

2.  **Install `pytest`:** If you don't already have it:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

3.  **Run:** Execute the tests from the command line:
    ```bash
    pytest test_suppliers.py
    ```


**Critical Next Steps for Real Testing:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder `Supplier` class with your actual implementation.
*   **Implement `related_functions`:**  Provide the necessary implementation for the methods that should be in the `related_functions` dictionary.
*   **More Comprehensive Tests:** The example tests are a very basic start. You need to include tests for various scenarios like different `supplier_prefix` values, valid and invalid data for the methods in `related_functions`, error handling, and more edge cases.


Remember that testing is an iterative process. As you write more tests and find bugs, you'll likely need to add more sophisticated test cases to ensure your code handles various scenarios.
