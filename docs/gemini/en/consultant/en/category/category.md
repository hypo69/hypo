**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

- Added type hints (`:param`, `:type`, `:return`) to functions and methods for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Replaced the use of `...` with `logger.error` statements for better error handling.
- Fixed potential issues with JSON loading in `crawl_categories` by handling exceptions.  Now uses `j_loads` correctly.
- Improved `check_duplicate_url` to use `logger.warning` for duplicate URL warnings and to be more efficient.
- Added comprehensive RST documentation for all functions, classes, and variables, adhering to Python docstring standards.
- Corrected the use of `j_dumps` and  `j_loads` to ensure correct handling of file operations.
