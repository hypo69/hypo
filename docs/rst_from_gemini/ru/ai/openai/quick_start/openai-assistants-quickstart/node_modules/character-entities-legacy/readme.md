A list of legacy HTML named character references that don't require a trailing semicolon.

## Summary

This package provides a list of legacy HTML named character references that, due to historical reasons, do not need a trailing semicolon.  This is primarily useful for tools like HTML parsers or minifiers, but is generally not necessary for most applications.  Alternatives like `parse-entities` and `stringify-entities` are often preferred for more robust and flexible character entity handling.

## What is this?

This package provides a JavaScript array containing a list of legacy HTML character entity names.  These names, unlike modern entities, do not require a semicolon (e.g., `&copy;` instead of `&copy;`).


## When should I use this?

This package is primarily intended for use by HTML parsing or minification tools.  For general use cases, consider using `parse-entities` or `stringify-entities` for more robust character entity handling.


## Installation

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+):**

```bash
npm install character-entities-legacy
```

**Deno:**

```typescript
import { characterEntitiesLegacy } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-legacy@2?dts';
```

**Browsers:**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { characterEntitiesLegacy } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-legacy@2?min';
</script>
```


## Usage

```typescript
import { characterEntitiesLegacy } from 'character-entities-legacy';

console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.includes('copy')); // true
console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.includes('frac34')); // true
console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.includes('sup1'));  // true
```


## API

This package exports only one identifier:

### `characterEntitiesLegacy`

A `Set` containing the legacy character entity names (case-sensitive). The decoded values of these entities are available in the `wooorm/character-entities` package.  Refer to the `whatwg/html` repository for more details on these legacy entities.


## Types

This package uses TypeScript definitions for complete type safety.


## Compatibility

This package supports all maintained versions of Node.js (12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+).  It also works in modern browsers and Deno.


## Security

This package is considered safe for use in production environments.
