```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import `read_xls_as_dict`:** Correctly imports the function from the `utils/xls` module instead of the incorrect `src.utils.convertors.xls`. This is crucial for testing the function directly.
* **`create_dummy_xls` function:** This function creates a temporary dummy XLS file with data to use in the tests. Critically, it also deletes the file after each test using `Path(filename).unlink(missing_ok=True)`. This prevents test failures from accumulated files and ensures that each test starts clean.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover more cases, including invalid file paths, files not existing, empty files, and files that aren't XLS (as noted in your code, the code seems intended to handle only XLS files).
* **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test if the correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs, such as non-existent or non-string filenames. It also includes checks to ensure the function returns `None` for invalid inputs, which is crucial for handling error cases in a real application.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are improved to check the specific expected behavior of the function, such as ensuring `result` is `None` for invalid input, and checks for the type of the return value.
* **File Cleanup:** Crucial addition: All test files are deleted after each test using `Path(filename).unlink(missing_ok=True)`. This keeps tests clean and avoids unexpected behavior in subsequent tests.
* **Specific Error Messages:** Checks if the expected error message is present in the exception to confirm that the exception handling is working correctly.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and accurate set of tests for the `xls2dict` function, addressing potential issues with invalid inputs and handling various edge cases. Remember to replace `"Dummy XLS file content"` with the expected contents of your dummy XLS files for more accurate testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_xls_converter.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_xls_converter.py
    ```
