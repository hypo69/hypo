.. module: src.suppliers.grandadvance
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to gather product field values from the `grandadvanse.co.il` product page.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    Override these functions in this class if non-standard processing is needed.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make it work, pass a value to `Context.locator`.
    If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines and redefine its behavior.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **`id_product` parameter in `local_saved_image`:**  The method now takes an `id_product` parameter. This is crucial for correctly naming the saved image file.  It's also added a check to make sure `id_product` exists.
* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling (using `try...except` blocks) is added to catch potential issues during image fetching and saving, logging errors, and returning appropriate values. This prevents crashes and provides helpful debugging information.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using more descriptive variable names (`filepath`, `success`) improves code readability.
* **`ProductFields` Initialization:**  The `grab_page` method now initializes a `ProductFields` object. This is vital for proper data storage and ensures `self.fields` is available and correctly populated within `grab_page`.
* **`_fetch_all_data` Helper Function:** A helper function is introduced to encapsulate the main data fetching logic. This improves code organization and readability.
* **Explicit Check for Image Data:** A check (`if raw`) ensures that the method doesn't continue if no image data is found.

**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (Your driver initialization)

graber = Graber(driver)
product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='your_product_id') 
# ... process product_data
```

Remember to replace `"your_product_id"` with the actual product ID, and adapt the `id_product` parameter in other methods if necessary.


This revised solution is significantly more robust, easier to understand, and safer to use in a production environment.  It demonstrates best practices for error handling and data integrity. Remember to implement the missing `id_product` logic for other methods if appropriate.
