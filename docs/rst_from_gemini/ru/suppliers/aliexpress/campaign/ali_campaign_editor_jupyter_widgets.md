```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to crucial parts (especially `__init__` and `display_widgets`) to catch and report `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions.  Critically important in real-world code.  This prevents the entire notebook from crashing.  Included `logging.exception` for better error reporting.


* **Explicit Language Option Checking:** The `__init__` now verifies that `locales` is not empty before trying to construct language options. This avoids a cryptic error later on.  It prints a useful error message to the console.


* **Descriptive Error Messages:**  Improved error messages to give more context to the user about the problem.


* **Logging:** Using `logging` for better error handling and output to see more details of failures.


* **Docstring Enhancement:** Added example usage to the docstring of `JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets`.


* **Removed Redundancy:** Removed the unnecessary `MODE` definition.


* **Improved Naming:** Changed variable names to be more descriptive (e.g., `language_options`).



**How to use in a Jupyter Notebook:**

```python
from ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets import JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets

editor_widgets = JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets()
editor_widgets.display_widgets()
```

This revised code is more robust and user-friendly, making it suitable for real-world applications within a Jupyter environment.  Remember to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already.  Crucially, this code now handles potential issues with the `locales` data, preventing common errors. Remember to properly configure your logging if you want details logged to a file.
