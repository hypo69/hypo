**Explanation and Improvements:**


1. **Import necessary modules:** `pytest`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging.version`, and `sys` are imported for testing and using the relevant functions.


2. **Clearer Test Function Names:** Function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_path`).


3. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The tests now explicitly check for cases where the marker files might not exist or are in a subdirectory.  The original code did not handle the case of the input path being relative, which was a significant oversight. The test now simulates a relative path and verifies that the script correctly finds the root directory.  


4. **Exception Handling:** The `try...except` blocks in the original code are correctly reflected in the tests.


5. **pytest.raises (for Exceptions):**  This has been removed as it's not appropriate for this function. We now test for valid return types.


6. **Fixture Implementation (if needed):**  Fixtures are not necessary for this particular function.


7. **Test Coverage:** The tests now cover the critical logic paths of `set_project_root`, including checking the validity of the returned path.


8. **Cleanup (crucial):** The code now includes cleanup steps to remove the dummy files created during the testing process. This prevents the test suite from leaving files behind and causing issues when running subsequent tests or when run multiple times.


**Important Considerations:**


- **Testing with specific files:** The code still lacks tests for cases where specific files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) might be present but not in a directory structure that the code expects.   This would need more sophisticated setup methods to create that correct directory structure.



- **Context management:** Using `with open(...)` is important to close files, particularly within tests for proper resource management.


Remember to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

Now you can run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
