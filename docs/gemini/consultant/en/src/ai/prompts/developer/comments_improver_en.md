Changes Made

- Added a comprehensive module docstring in reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Added docstrings to `process_code` and `process_multiple_files` functions in RST format, specifying parameters, return types, and potential exceptions.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` as per requirement.
- Incorporated error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks for better debugging.  Proper exception handling and re-raising of the exception are kept in the examples, in case re-raising is needed.
- Added type hints for function parameters and return types.
- Added empty `return None` statements in the error blocks to prevent potential errors if no value is returned.
