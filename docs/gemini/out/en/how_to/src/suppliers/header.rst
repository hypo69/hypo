How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It searches upward from the current file's directory until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). If found, the function returns the path to the root directory and adds it to the Python path. Otherwise, it returns the directory where the script is located. It then loads project settings from `settings.json` and project documentation from `README.MD`, handling potential errors if these files are not found. Finally, it extracts various project metadata (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, coffee link) from the settings and assigns them to variables.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports modules like `sys`, `json`, `Path` from the `pathlib` module, and `Version` from the `packaging.version` module.

2. **Define the `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker files as input.

3. **Find the project root:** The function starts from the current file's directory and iterates through its parent directories until a directory containing any of the specified marker files is found.

4. **Append root to sys.path:** If the root directory is not already in the Python path, it's added to the beginning (`sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))`). This is crucial for importing modules from the project's other directories.

5. **Return the root directory:** The function returns the determined root directory.

6. **Get project root:** The `__root__` variable is set by calling `set_project_root()`.

7. **Load project settings:** It tries to open and parse the `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory of the project root. If the file is not found or if there's an error in parsing the JSON, a `...` is executed; in practice, this is likely an exception handling block to prevent the script from crashing.

8. **Load project documentation:** It tries to open the `README.MD` file located in the `src` directory of the project root. If the file is not found or if there's an error in reading the file, a `...` is executed.

9. **Extract project metadata:** The code retrieves project metadata (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, coffee link) from the `settings` dictionary, handling cases where the settings are not loaded or contain missing keys.  Defaults are provided if a value isn't found.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have a project structure with pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, .git, etc.)
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.header import set_project_root

    root_path = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {root_path}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Project documentation: {__doc__}")
