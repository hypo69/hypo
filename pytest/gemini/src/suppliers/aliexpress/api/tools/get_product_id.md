**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `extract_prod_ids`:**  Crucially, the original code now correctly delegates to `extract_prod_ids`.  The tests will now cover the actual implementation.

2. **`product_id_data` Fixture:** This fixture provides a structured way to test various inputs and their expected outputs.  It's far more readable and maintainable than repeating similar assertions in individual test functions.  It handles both cases where a product ID is found and where it's not.

3. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now directly assert the expected output when a product ID is found. They also use `pytest.raises` to verify that `ProductIdNotFoundException` is raised when expected.

4. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Tests now cover empty strings, `None` input (which raises `TypeError` in the correct way), and non-matching input strings.

5. **Explicit Exception Handling:** The test for invalid input is improved by explicitly checking for the expected exception message.

6. **`TypeError` Handling:** Added a test to check for the correct behavior when `None` is passed, as it would raise `TypeError` in `extract_prod_ids`.

This revised solution addresses potential issues and provides more comprehensive and robust tests for the function. Remember to have the `extract_prod_ids` function and `ProductIdNotFoundException` defined in the correct modules for the tests to work. Also, make sure the `hypotez` directory structure and files are correctly set up for import paths.
