# Changes Made

*   Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) for the module and the `PwExecutor` class, including `execute_script` method, following RST conventions.
*   Added missing imports for `asyncio`, `typing`, `playwright`, `jjson`, and `logger`. Placeholder imports (`from ... import ...`) are included for potential dependencies not provided in the original code snippet.
*   Replaced the placeholder `...` with meaningful comments, explaining the purpose of the code sections.
*   Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks for more informative error reporting.
*   Improved variable names and code structure for clarity.
*   Added type hints for function parameters and return types (`self.page: Page`) for better code readability and maintainability.
*   Added example usage to the module docstring demonstrating how to use `PwExecutor`.
