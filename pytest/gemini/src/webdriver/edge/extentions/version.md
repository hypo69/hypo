**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names now explicitly state the aspect being tested (e.g., `test_version_format`).

2. **Specific Format Validation:** The `test_version_format` now checks that the version string has the expected number of parts separated by dots. This is crucial as the example version format given is not arbitrary; it must be validated to ensure the code works as intended. Crucially, it checks if *each part* is a valid integer.

3. **Edge Case Testing (Empty/None):** The added tests `test_version_non_empty` and `test_version_not_none` cover cases where the version string might be empty or None, which would lead to errors later on in the code.

4. **Comprehensive Numeric Check:**  `test_version_contains_number` checks if the version string has at least one digit, further ensuring it's not entirely non-numerical.  This would catch a completely broken version string (e.g., "abc").

5. **Hypothetical Function (Illustrative):** The commented-out `test_get_version` section demonstrates how you would write a test for a hypothetical function (`get_version`) that returns the version string if one existed in the code being tested.

6. **Robustness:** The tests are designed to be more robust in handling different scenarios, including cases where the version string might not conform to the expected format or if other logic is involved.


**How to use with pytest:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code (above) as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  **Run:** Run pytest from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_version.py
    ```

This improved set of tests provides a more complete and reliable way to ensure the `__version__` attribute is correct and functional. Remember to replace the placeholder comments if you have a function to test. Remember to adjust the tests according to the actual versioning format used in the code.
