**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Fix:**

1. **`prepare_product_async` Enhancement:**
   - **Crucial Fix:** The previous code had a closure issue. The `prepare_product_async` method was creating a `AliCampaignEditor` instance *inside* the `clicked` signal handler.  This meant that all calls to `prepare_product_async` would refer to the *same* `AliCampaignEditor` instance.  If one call to `prepare_product_async` was in progress, subsequent calls would interfere with the first.
   - **Solution:**  Now, `AliCampaignEditor` is created *inside* `prepare_product_async`, using `self.editor = AliCampaignEditor(...)` **within the method**. This guarantees a new instance is created each time the button is pressed, fixing the closure issues and race conditions.
   - **Threading (crucial):** Added `QtCore.QThreadPool.globalInstance().start(partial(self.editor.prepare_product))`. This uses Qt's thread pool to handle the asynchronous operation in a separate thread. This is essential to prevent the GUI from freezing while the preparation is running.  *This is the most important change.*


2. **Error Handling:** The error handling in `prepare_product_async` is now improved to provide a more user-friendly message.

3. **Empty Data Check:** A check is added in `prepare_product_async` to make sure that `data` is not empty. If a file hasn't been loaded, a warning message is displayed.



**How to Use:**

1. Make sure you have the necessary imports (`QtWidgets`, `QtGui`, `QtCore`, `partial`, `QtCore.QThreadPool`).
2. Call `ProductEditor(...)` to create the editor widget.
3. Include the code in your main application logic.
4. Call `app.exec_()` to start the Qt application.

This improved code addresses the critical closure problem, makes the asynchronous operation more robust, and offers better user feedback.  The use of `QThreadPool` is key for responsiveness. Remember to install the PyQt6 package if you haven't already.
