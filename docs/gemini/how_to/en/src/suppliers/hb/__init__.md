## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/__init__.py`, is a Python module likely part of a larger project related to data suppliers, specifically interacting with a system/service referred to as "hb". It initializes functionality within the `hb` supplier module.

**Key Points:**

* **Initialization:** The primary function of this file appears to be initializing the `hb` supplier.
* **Module Import:** It imports the `Graber` class from a submodule named `.graber`. This implies that the `Graber` class provides the core functionality for fetching/processing data from the "hb" source.
* **Global Variable `MODE`:**  A global variable `MODE` is set to the string `'dev'`. This suggests a mode selection (e.g., development, production), influencing how the code behaves.  Further context would be useful to determine the implications of this mode.

**How to Use:**

1. **Import the `Graber` class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.hb import Graber
```

2. **Instantiate a `Graber` object:**

```python
graber_instance = Graber()
```

3. **Use the `Graber` methods:**

   The `Graber` class likely has methods for interacting with the "hb" service.  Without the code for `Graber`, we cannot specify the exact method calls.  Likely, you'll need to pass parameters for the specific data or operation required, such as a query string, filter criteria, etc.


**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.hb import Graber

# Instantiate the Graber object
graber_instance = Graber()

# Example usage, assuming a method called 'get_data'
data = graber_instance.get_data(query_string='some_query', filter_criteria={'key': 'value'})

# Now process the retrieved data 'data'
# ...
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Context:**  The `hypotez` project context is unknown. Without knowing the intended use cases or the `Graber` class methods, the guide is general. Review the documentation or the surrounding code for specific information about parameter usage and expected output.
* **Error Handling:** Robust code should include error handling.  The `Graber` methods likely raise exceptions if something goes wrong.  Ensure you have appropriate exception handling to catch and manage errors.
* **`MODE` Variable:** The `MODE` variable's impact on behavior needs to be understood. It may affect data sources, logging, or other crucial aspects of the `hb` supplier.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Examine the `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/graber.py` file** to understand the `Graber` class methods and their arguments.
2. **Study the surrounding code and unit tests (if present)** to get context on how to interact with this class in different scenarios.
3. **Provide more information** about your specific use case if you want a more detailed guide. For example, what data you want to retrieve from "hb" and what actions you need to perform.
