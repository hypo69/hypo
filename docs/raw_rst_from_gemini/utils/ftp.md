""" module: src.utils """


"""
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.  (Not implemented in this example)
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.  (Not directly used, but good practice)


Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Much more robust error handling.  The `try...except` blocks now catch specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` and provide more informative error messages.
* **Clearer Exception Messages:**  Logging now includes the specific exception and its message.
* **File Existence Check:** Added `os.path.exists()` to prevent `FileNotFoundError` when attempting to send a non-existent file.
* **Environment Variables:** The code now retrieves the connection details from environment variables (`FTP_SERVER`, `FTP_PORT`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASSWORD`).  This is critical for security.  Do *not* hardcode credentials directly into your Python code.
* **Type Safety (Improved):** Improved type handling for `FTP_PORT` to prevent errors.
* **`finally` block improvements:** Ensures the FTP session is closed even if errors occur within the `try` block.
* **Return Values:** `read` now returns `None` if there is an error, instead of implicitly returning `None` based on an exception. This is clearer and better for handling potential errors in the calling code.


**How to use (crucial):**

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export FTP_SERVER="your_ftp_server"
   export FTP_PORT="21"  # or whatever port
   export FTP_USER="your_ftp_username"
   export FTP_PASSWORD="your_ftp_password"
   ```

2. **Import and Use:**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.ftp import write, read, delete

# Example usage (replace with your paths and filenames)
try:
    success = write("path/to/local/file.txt", "/remote/directory", "filename.txt")
    if success:
        print("File sent successfully!")
    else:
        print("Failed to send file.")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"File not found error: {e}")
```

This revised solution is much safer, more robust, and more maintainable.  Remember to adapt the error handling and logging to match your specific needs. Always prioritize security and avoid hardcoding credentials. Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.
