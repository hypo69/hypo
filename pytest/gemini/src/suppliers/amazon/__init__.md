**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `Graber`:** The crucial improvement is mocking the `Graber` class.  The original code likely depends on external data sources.  Testing `get_list_products_in_category` without mocking `Graber`'s `get_products` method would test the *interaction* with an external source, which is not reliable or repeatable.  The tests now mock the external data return, making the tests more robust and reliable.

2. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Descriptions in the test functions explain *why* the test is performed.

3. **Comprehensive Scenarios:**  Tests now include cases with empty input, None input, and valid input (with the mock).

4. **Robustness:** The tests are more thorough by checking if the output is a list and the length of the list.  This anticipates potential issues in the production code that might not return the expected structure.

5. **Graber Tests:** The code now includes rudimentary tests for `Graber`.  **Crucially**, Graber-specific tests should focus on the logic within Graber and *not* rely on external data in these tests. Mocking `get_products` is essential to isolate the behavior of `Graber`.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_amazon_supplier.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_amazon_supplier.py
    ```


**Further Enhancements (Highly Recommended):**

*   **Error Handling:** Add tests for exceptions that `Graber` might raise (e.g., `IOError`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`).
*   **More Realistic Data:** Use more complex, realistic product data in fixtures for better test coverage.
*   **Edge Cases:** Test with various edge cases for `get_list_products_in_category`, such as very large category names or special characters.
*   **Integration with `pytest-mock`:** For more advanced mocking and patching, consider using `pytest-mock`.
