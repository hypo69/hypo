**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now includes `MockDriver` and `MockLogger` to mock the `Driver` and `logger`.  This is crucial for testing the `Graber` class without relying on actual web driver interactions (which would be slow and unreliable in tests).


2. **`pytest.fixture` for resources:** The `driver_and_logger` fixture provides the `Driver` and `logger` instances, making them available to all the tests. This is a standard and better practice than passing them to each test function directly.


3. **Clearer Test Cases:** The tests are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_initialization`), and include explanations of the test's purpose.


4. **Exception Handling:**  The example `test_graber_with_invalid_driver_type` demonstrates how to test for exceptions.  If your code has other exception conditions, test those cases using `pytest.raises`.


5. **Incomplete Tests:** The provided code lacked the body of `close_pop_up`. This portion of the test is commented out. To properly test `close_pop_up` a complete implementation of `close_pop_up` and the necessary mocks are needed.


6. **Asyncio:** If your code uses `async` functions, you should mark the test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and use `await` statements to test them properly.  An example of this has been added as `test_async_function_with_driver` (but remember to put in the async function).


**Important Considerations:**

* **Implement `close_pop_up`:**  You need to write the `close_pop_up` decorator function (the commented-out part) with complete logic.  
* **Complete Function Testing:**  The example `test_function_using_driver` is meant to be an example.  You must write test cases for any function that `Graber` or its related functions call.
* **Comprehensive Inputs:** Create tests with various valid and invalid inputs, edge cases (e.g., empty lists, large values, etc.), boundary conditions.  The existing tests should be expanded.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_graber.py`) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_graber.py` from your terminal.


Remember to adapt and expand these tests based on the specific logic and functionalities of your code.  A robust test suite should cover all code paths and edge cases.
