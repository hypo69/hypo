**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Tests:** The code now includes tests for `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`,  validating their types and potentially the content based on your expected structure.

2. **Edge Case for `__details__`:** The `test_details_keys` function is added to check for the presence of expected keys in the `__details__` dictionary, ensuring that critical data isn't missing.

3. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more explicit about what the test is checking. For example, `isinstance(__version__, str)` is better than a simple `assert __version__`.

4. **Flexibility:**  The `expected_keys` list is now configurable; you can easily adapt this to your needs.  You should replace `"author"` with the actual keys you expect in your `__details__` dictionary.

5. **Example test cases for __details__ (Important):**  The example comments (`test_details_author`) illuStarte how to validate the *content* of the values in the dictionary.  You need to replace `"Your Name"` with the expected value from your code.

6. **Robustness**: The tests are written to be more robust against potential variations in the structure and presence of data.

7. **Missing Code:**  The comments `# Tests for constants (if any)` and `# Tests for potential missing keys in __details__` are placeholders. You'll need to add those tests if there are other constants or potentially missing values in your code's output.

**How to Use and Adapt:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Update `expected_keys` and the content checks (`test_details_author` example) with the actual expected structure and values from your `__init__.py` file.

2. **Add More Tests:** If your code defines other functions or variables, write tests for those as well, including tests for edge cases and expected exceptions.

3. **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to run these tests: `pytest hypotez/src/templates/_examples/test_init.py` (or adjust the file path).

**Crucial Note:**  The most important aspect of testing is thoroughly understanding the intended behavior of your `__init__.py` file.  Add more tests to cover various possible use cases based on the actual logic of the code in the file.  If your code has more functions or classes (beyond the already tested `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and possibly constants), you'll need to write more tests for them.
