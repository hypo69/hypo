<h1>How to Install Chrome for Testing</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document outlines the steps for installing and configuring Chrome for use in automated web testing with the Hypotez framework.</p>

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Download the Chrome Browser Installer:</strong> Visit the official Chrome downloads page at <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a> and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.</li>
  <li><strong>Run the Installer:</strong> Execute the downloaded installer. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.</li>
  <li><strong>Configure Chrome for Testing (Optional but Recommended):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disable Extensions:</strong> Extensions can interfere with automated tests. It's best practice to disable all extensions during testing.</li>
      <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> Create a dedicated user profile for testing to isolate test data and configurations from your everyday browser usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Proxy Settings:</strong>  If your network requires proxy settings, configure your browser's proxy settings accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>After installation, launch Chrome.  Ensure the browser functions correctly, and confirm you can access and interact with web pages.  This step is crucial to validate successful installation.</p>

<h2>Further Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ChromeDriver:</strong>  For automated testing, you'll need the ChromeDriver, a separate executable that allows Python scripts to control Chrome. Download the appropriate version for your Chrome version from <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads">https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Path Variables:</strong> Ensure the location of the ChromeDriver executable is added to your system's PATH environment variable for easy access by your scripts. This is essential for your testing scripts to locate and interact with the driver.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Installation Issues:</strong> If you encounter problems during installation, consult the Chrome support documentation or search for specific error messages.</li>
  <li><strong>ChromeDriver Compatibility:</strong> Make sure that the ChromeDriver version is compatible with your Chrome version.</li>
  <li><strong>Proxy Configuration:</strong> Review your proxy settings if access to certain websites is restricted during testing.</li>
</ul>
