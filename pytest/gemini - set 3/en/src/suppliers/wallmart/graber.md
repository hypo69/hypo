```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `Driver` object, crucial for testing asynchronous functions without actually interacting with a browser.  `MagicMock` is used for mocking, which is more robust than simple `return values` because it has attributes you can stub out if needed.

2. **`@patch` for asyncio:**  The `test_grab_page_error_handling` function uses `@patch` to patch `asyncio` to avoid actual asynchronous calls and making the test predictable.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_grab_page_error_handling`  test demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for `ExecuteLocatorException` being raised, as specified in the prompt.

4. **No Data Scenario:** `test_grab_page_no_data` is added to test the case where no data is returned from any of the internal functions, and returns `None` in response.  This is a crucial edge case.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now check for the expected types and values, improving the test's clarity and reliability.


6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The initial tests cover the fundamental aspect of `grab_page` by mocking the data fetching functions and asserting that the expected `ProductFields` type is returned.

7. **Fixture for ProductFields:** A `mock_product_fields` fixture is added to create mock instances, simplifying test setup and making tests more focused.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
2.  **Save:** Save the test code (as `test_graber.py`, for example) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.
3.  **Run:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory, then run: `pytest test_graber.py`


**Next Steps:**

* **Test Individual Methods:** Create individual test functions (e.g., `test_id_product_valid_input`, `test_name_invalid_input`) to thoroughly test the functions within `Graber` that fetch data. This will cover edge cases and invalid data appropriately.
* **Specific Scenarios:** Add more tests to cover different scenarios, such as when specific inputs to `grab_page` might affect the expected results.  This will require more detailed knowledge of the specific function of the `ProductFields` class.

Remember to adjust the test assertions based on the expected behavior of your code when faced with various inputs (including errors) and missing data.
