```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.webdriver.firefox import Firefox

def test_firefox_module_exists():
    """Verifies that the Firefox module is importable."""
    assert Firefox is not None, "Firefox module not found."


def test_firefox_mode_exists():
    """Checks for existence of the MODE constant."""
    assert hasattr(Firefox, "MODE"), "The MODE constant is missing."


# This next test will fail since the init file doesn't define
#  the MODE constant in the expected manner.
# We need a version of Firefox.py for a more specific test.
# def test_firefox_mode_value():
#     """Checks the value of the MODE constant."""
#     assert Firefox.MODE == 'development', "MODE constant has unexpected value"
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The code now correctly imports the `Firefox` class from the specified module.

2. **Module Existence:** `test_firefox_module_exists` checks if the `Firefox` module is importable. This is a fundamental test.

3. **Constant Existence:** `test_firefox_mode_exists` verifies that the `MODE` attribute exists in the `Firefox` class.  This is an important check because the `MODE` constant is being used elsewhere. (Important because the import statement is only valid within the proper directory)

4. **Mode Value (commented out):** The test `test_firefox_mode_value` (commented out) checks for the expected value of the `MODE` constant.  **Crucially,** this test *cannot* be run as it currently stands because the `__init__.py` file does *not* contain the `MODE` constant; it only imports the `Firefox` class. You need a `Firefox.py` file to run this test.

5. **Missing File:** The provided `__init__.py` file only imports a class `Firefox`. To write meaningful tests, you need a `Firefox.py` file that defines the `Firefox` class and the `MODE` constant.

**How to Use and Extend:**

1. **Create `Firefox.py`:** Create a `Firefox.py` file in the specified directory containing the class definition and the `MODE` variable:

   ```python
   # hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/Firefox.py
   MODE = 'development'

   class Firefox:
       def __init__(self, options=None):
           # ... (implementation of the Firefox class) ...
           pass
   ```

2. **Run pytest:**  Place your `test_firefox.py` file in the same directory as the `__init__.py` or in a test directory in the appropriate folder structure so that `pytest` can find it.  Then, run `pytest test_firefox.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides a basic but robust set of tests targeting the `__init__.py` import and checks for existence of the `MODE` constant.  For a complete test suite you'd need to add tests that check functionality of the `Firefox` class itself (which is currently missing). Remember to include more tests for inputs, edge cases, and error handling in your `Firefox.py` file as you develop that class.
