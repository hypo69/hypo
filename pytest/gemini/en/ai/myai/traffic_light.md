```python
import pytest
import src.ai.myai.traffic_light as traffic_light

# No meaningful test data can be created from the provided code.
# The code only defines a module and some constants.
# Therefore, the following tests are placeholders and will fail.


def test_mode_is_development():
    """Checks if the MODE constant is 'development'."""
    assert traffic_light.MODE == 'development', "MODE should be 'development'"
    
# Placeholder test - needs real functions to test
def test_function_not_implemented():
    """This test will fail until actual functions are implemented."""
    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
        traffic_light.some_function()
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided Python code (`traffic_light.py`) is extremely basic. It doesn't contain any functions or methods to test.  Consequently, the test cases are also very basic, demonstrating the proper structure for testing a module but not providing meaningful validation.

To create *useful* tests, you need to provide the actual functions, classes, and methods from your `traffic_light.py` file.  The placeholder test functions above will illustrate the correct way to use `pytest`, but won't actually *test* anything meaningful.

**Example (Illustrative):**

If `traffic_light.py` contained a function like this:

```python
def calculate_traffic_time(cars):
    """Calculates the time needed for traffic lights to cycle based on cars."""
    if cars < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of cars cannot be negative")
    return cars * 2 # Example logic
```

Then the corresponding test suite would be:

```python
import pytest
import src.ai.myai.traffic_light as traffic_light

def test_calculate_traffic_time_positive():
    assert traffic_light.calculate_traffic_time(5) == 10
    
def test_calculate_traffic_time_zero():
    assert traffic_light.calculate_traffic_time(0) == 0

def test_calculate_traffic_time_negative():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        traffic_light.calculate_traffic_time(-5)
```


**Key improvements to make your tests robust:**

* **Real functions:** Replace the placeholder functions with tests for actual functions in your `traffic_light.py` file.
* **Input validation:** Test various input conditions for each function, especially edge cases and invalid data.
* **Expected outputs:** Clearly define the *expected* results for different inputs in your tests.  Assertions should verify those expected outputs.
* **Error handling:** Use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling when appropriate (e.g., invalid input).
* **Fixtures (if needed):**  If your functions rely on data or resources, define fixtures to provide them in a reusable way.



Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual function definitions for proper testing.  Without that code, tests are useless.
