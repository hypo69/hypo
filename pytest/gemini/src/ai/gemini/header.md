```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Test Data:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create the necessary dummy files (`config.json`, `pyproject.toml`) for the tests, ensuring each test runs in an isolated environment without affecting others. This is crucial for testing file-dependent operations.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the input and expected outcome.

3. **Handling Exceptions:** The code includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions that are properly handled by the `set_project_root` function.

4. **Edge Cases:** The tests now explicitly cover cases where the marker file is not found, the file is in a subdirectory, or the current directory is the project root.

5. **Mocking/Stubbing (`config_file` fixture):**  Critically, the `config_file` fixture creates a temporary `config.json` file, allowing you to control the contents for different test scenarios.  This eliminates the need to manipulate the filesystem directly, making your tests more robust and isolated.

6. **`tmp_path` fixture:**  Uses pytest's `tmp_path` fixture to create temporary directories for the test files, avoiding conflicts and cleanup issues.

7. **Import Statement:** Explicitly imports `set_project_root`.

8. **Error Handling in Tests:** The test functions now have clear error handling to gracefully catch potential issues during file operations.

9. **Robustness:**  The tests are designed to be more robust by checking specific conditions like file existence, avoiding potentially unpredictable behavior with implicit file access.

This revised solution is much more comprehensive and better suited for testing the `set_project_root` function in isolation, covering both expected and unexpected behaviors. Remember to install `pytest` and `packaging` if you don't have them already:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
