**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Crucially, I've added `dummy_project_structure` and `dummy_invalid_settings` fixtures. This isolates the tests by creating a temporary directory structure and files within it for testing `set_project_root` and the other functions.  This is a much better approach than trying to manipulate the filesystem directly in each test function.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Improved the names of the tests to be more descriptive.
* **Exception Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, demonstrating handling of expected exceptions.
* **Edge Cases:** Included tests for cases where marker files might not be present, or when they are in nested directories. This is important for robustness.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Demonstrates correct use for exception handling.
* **Mocking/Isolation:** Using fixtures (like `dummy_project_structure`) to create the necessary files is essential for writing effective tests.
* **Correct `__root__` assignment:**  The tests now properly assign the `__root__` attribute.
* **File Unlinking:**  The test for `test_load_readme_file_not_found` now deletes the `README.MD` file to simulate the file not being present, ensuring the code handles both the absence and presence of the file correctly.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved solution is much more robust and demonstrates a better approach to testing Python code using `pytest`. Remember to adjust the imports and file paths if needed according to your project structure. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you don't have it already.
