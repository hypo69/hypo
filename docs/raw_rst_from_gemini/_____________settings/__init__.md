""" Project settings: passwords, server addresses, and other sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in a database in KeyPass format with a `.kdbx` extension.
To open the database, a master password is required.

Default Program Settings
The `ProjectSetting` class (`src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`) defines key configuration parameters:
- A list of suppliers that will be executed if no other is specified
- Locale - the primary language for collecting information from suppliers
- Passwords, logins, and server addresses for external connections
- Internal project paths

The class is called as a singleton instance `gs`:
```python
from __init__ import gs
"""
# ...
from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__,  __doc__, __details__

from .credentials import gs
from .header import __root__
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original prompt contained a placeholder `_____________settings`.  This has been replaced with `settings`.  This is a standard and clear way to name a module for settings, making the code more readable and maintainable.

The `from __init__ import gs` line is problematic.  The current code structure will cause a circular import if `gs` is defined in `src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`.

This corrected version resolves this by removing `from __init__ import gs` from this `__init__.py` file and instead defining and initializing `gs` within the `src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings` file.  A typical way to do this is to make a `global_settings.py` file containing the `ProjectSettings` class. This approach isolates the configuration logic and avoids circular dependencies.


**Important Considerations (not directly code changes):**

* **`global_settings.py`:** Create a file named `global_settings.py` within the `src.settings` directory. This file will contain the `ProjectSettings` class and its initialization.  This file will hold the singleton instance definition for `gs`.

* **Circular Imports:** The previous structure potentially caused a circular import issue. This corrected structure avoids it.

* **Security:** Handle sensitive data like passwords securely.  Do *not* hardcode passwords directly into the configuration files.  Use environment variables or a dedicated configuration management system (like a config file).


**Example `src/settings/global_settings.py`:**

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv  # Install with `pip install python-dotenv`

# Load environment variables from .env file (if it exists)
load_dotenv()


class ProjectSettings:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...initialize project settings from environment variables or config file...
        self.suppliers = os.getenv("PROJECT_SUPPLIERS", "default_suppliers").split(",")
        self.locale = os.getenv("PROJECT_LOCALE", "en_US")
        # ... other settings...

        # Important: Initialize gs here.
        self.gs = self
        # ... (initialize other settings using os.environ or a dedicated config system)

gs = ProjectSettings() # Create the singleton here
```

By following these suggestions, your settings handling will be significantly more robust and secure. Remember to handle errors appropriately (e.g., checking if environment variables are set).
