# hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py`, provides utility functions for project initialization and configuration. It defines a function to locate the project root directory and loads settings from a JSON file.  It also handles fetching and parsing project metadata.

## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: This function locates the root directory of the project. It starts from the directory of the current file and searches up the directory tree until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If no such directory is found, it returns the directory where the script is located. It adds the project root directory to the Python path if it's not already present.

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): A tuple containing file or directory names to identify the project root. Defaults to (`'pyproject.toml'`, `'requirements.txt'`, `.git`).


**Returns**:

- `Path`: The path to the root directory of the project.


**Raises**:

-  No exceptions are explicitly raised.


### Module Global Variables (from settings.json)

- __project_name__ (str): Name of the project.
- __version__ (str): Version of the project.
- __doc__ (str): Project documentation.
- __details__ (str): Project details.
- __author__ (str): Author of the project.
- __copyright__ (str): Copyright of the project.
- __cofee__ (str): A link to a donation platform.

```python
def set_project_root(marker_files=(\'pyproject.toml\', \'requirements.txt\', \'.git\')) -> Path:
    """
    Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory,
    searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.

    Args:
        marker_files (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.

    Returns:
        Path: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.
    """
    __root__:Path
    current_path:Path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    __root__ = current_path
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
            __root__ = parent
            break
    if __root__ not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))
    return __root__
```
```

**Explanation of Global Variable Handling:**

The module loads settings from a `settings.json` file located in the project's `src` directory.  If the file is not found or invalid JSON is encountered, default values are used. This makes the code robust to the absence or corruption of this configuration file. The fetched data (e.g., `project_name`, `version`) is assigned to the corresponding module-level variables. Missing values are handled by providing a default value if the settings file is missing or if a key isn't present.
