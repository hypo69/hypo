How to use the PriceListRequester class
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a `PriceListRequester` class that inherits from the `PrestaShop` class.  It's designed to retrieve price lists from a PrestaShop API. The class provides methods to request prices for specific products, update the data source, and modify product prices.  The `request_prices` method is crucial for fetching price information, while `modify_product_price` handles updating prices within the system.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** Create an instance of `PriceListRequester` by passing a dictionary containing API credentials (`api_domain` and `api_key`).

2. **Requesting Prices:** Call the `request_prices` method, passing a list of product identifiers. This method is responsible for making an API call to retrieve the prices for these products.  Critically, the `pass` statement in the current implementation needs to be replaced with the actual API interaction code.

3. **Handling the Response:**  The `request_prices` method is expected to return a dictionary where keys are product names and values are their corresponding prices.

4. **Updating the Source:** If the data source needs to be changed, call the `update_source` method, passing the new source. This step would be necessary if the API endpoint or database connection changed.

5. **Modifying Prices:** The `modify_product_price` method allows updating the price of a specific product.  Again, this method currently only contains a `pass` statement and requires the implementation of the necessary logic to modify the data source.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.pricelist import PriceListRequester
    import os


    # Replace with your actual credentials
    api_credentials = {
        'api_domain': 'your-prestashop-api-domain',
        'api_key': 'your-api-key'
    }


    # Example usage (replace with actual products)
    products_to_fetch = ['product_a', 'product_b', 'product_c']

    # Initialize the requester
    price_requester = PriceListRequester(api_credentials)


    try:
        # Request prices
        prices = price_requester.request_prices(products_to_fetch)

        if prices:
          for product, price in prices.items():
              print(f"Price for {product}: {price}")

        # Example updating the source (replace with your logic)
        new_source = 'new_data_source'
        price_requester.update_source(new_source)

        # Example modifying a price (replace with your logic)
        price_requester.modify_product_price('product_a', 12.99)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
