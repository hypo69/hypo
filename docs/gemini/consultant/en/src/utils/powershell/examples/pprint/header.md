```
## Changes Made

- Added missing import statements (`from src.logger import logger`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`).
- Added a `get_project_root` function to obtain the project root path more reliably.  The original method is error-prone.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads`.
- Added detailed RST-style docstrings for the module, `get_project_root` function, and `example_pprint_function`.
- Incorporated error handling using `logger.error` instead of `try-except` for better logging and readability.
- Removed commented-out code blocks that seem unnecessary.
- Reformatted some code blocks for better readability.


```
