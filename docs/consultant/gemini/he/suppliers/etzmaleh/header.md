```
Changes Made
```

* **Import `j_loads`:** Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
* **Error Handling:** Replaced `try...except` blocks with `logger.error` for better error handling and reduced code duplication.  # Important change.
* **`settings` Initialization:** Set `settings` to an empty dictionary in case of error loading settings to avoid `NoneType` errors.  # Critical fix.
* **`doc_str` Initialization:** Initialized `doc_str` to an empty string to avoid `NoneType` issues when `README.MD` doesn't exist. # Critical fix.
* **Improved Variable Names:** Renamed `settings_file` to `settings_file` for consistency.
* **Docstrings:** Added RST-formatted docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes.
* **Comments:** Added comprehensive comments to explain the code's logic and purpose.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** Ensured consistent spacing and formatting according to PEP 8.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints where appropriate.
* **Removed Redundant Imports:** Removed unnecessary import of `json` (already imported `j_loads`).
* **`logger` Import:** Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
* **Variable Name Consistency:** Changed `__root__` to `project_root` for consistency.
