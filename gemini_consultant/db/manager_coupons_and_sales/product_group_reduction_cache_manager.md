**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Credential Handling:** The code now explicitly requires `credentials` in the constructor.  Critically, it checks for `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it's not provided.  This prevents cryptic errors later.  The example demonstrates loading credentials from a file like `credentials.py`. You need to replace this placeholder with how you actually retrieve your database credentials.
* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is added to the `__init__` and other methods.  This is essential in production code to avoid crashes and provide informative error messages.
* **Context Management (`__enter__`, `__exit__`):** The `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are now used properly within a `try...except` block.  This is crucial to ensure that the database session is correctly closed, preventing resource leaks and potential errors.  The `__exit__` method, now implemented, correctly closes the session.
* **Import of Credentials:** The code now correctly imports the `credentials` from the correct location (e.g., a `credentials.py` file).
* **Example Usage (with error handling):** The provided example usage now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors when creating the `ProductGroupReductionCacheManager`.  This is *essential* in production code.
* **Session Closing:** The example code now demonstrates how to properly close the session using the context manager protocol. This is a crucial addition to prevent resource leaks.

**How to use with your actual credentials:**

1. **Create `credentials.py`:**  Put your database credentials in a separate file, like this:

```python
# credentials.py
credentials = {
    'db_server': 'your_db_server',
    'db_port': 3306,
    'db_name': 'your_db_name',
    'db_user': 'your_db_user',
    'db_password': 'your_db_password',
}
```

2. **Adjust Imports:** Make sure your import statements in `product_group_reduction_cache_manager.py` point to `credentials.py`:


```python
from .credentials import credentials
```


This significantly improves the robustness and maintainability of your code by handling errors, closing resources properly, and correctly managing credentials. Remember to replace the placeholder values in `credentials.py` with your actual database credentials.
