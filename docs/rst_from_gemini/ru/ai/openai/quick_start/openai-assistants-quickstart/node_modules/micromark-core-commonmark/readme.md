This package provides the core CommonMark constructs for [micromark][].  These constructs are essential for parsing CommonMark-compliant markdown and should generally not be disabled unless you're creating a very specialized parser.

## What is this?

This package exposes the core CommonMark constructs implemented within micromark.  These constructs define the basic building blocks of how CommonMark is parsed and interpreted.

## When should I use this?

You'll typically use this package as a dependency *within* your own micromark extension packages, or if you are building a custom markdown parser using micromark's API. Direct use of this package is generally not required for simple parsing tasks.

## Installation

This package is **ESM only**.

**Node.js (version 16+)**

```bash
npm install micromark-core-commonmark
```

**Deno**

```typescript
import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@latest'; // Replace 'latest' with the desired version.
```

**Browsers (using esm.sh)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@latest?bundle';
</script>
```

**Important:**  Always use the latest version for security updates and bug fixes.  Importantly, the use of `esm.sh` requires the `?bundle` query parameter for browser compatibility.


## Usage

This package doesn't have a default export, so you need to explicitly import the constructs you need.

```javascript
import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark';

// Example usage (assuming you have some markdown to parse)
const parsedResult = autolink(markdownString); // or whatever parsing function you are using micromark for.

console.log(parsedResult);
```


## API Reference

This module exports the following constructs:  (The list is from the original, but it might be better to organize them logically)

* `attention`
* `autolink`
* `blankLine`
* `blockQuote`
* ... (list all constructs)


Refer to the micromark documentation for detailed explanations of each construct and their behavior.

## Types

This package is fully type-safe with TypeScript.  However, there are no additional exported types beyond those of micromark itself.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with `micromark@^3`.  Follow micromark's compatibility guidelines.


## Security

This package is designed to be secure.  Refer to the `security.md` file in the micromark repository for reporting security vulnerabilities.


## Contributing

Refer to the `contributing.md` file in the micromark repository for guidelines on how to contribute.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Clearer introduction:**  Explains the purpose more clearly and emphasizes the role within micromark extensions.
* **Emphasis on ESM:**  Explicitly states that the package is ESM-only and provides clear installation instructions for different environments.
* **Usage Example:**  Provides a more complete and relevant usage example, showing how to import and potentially use a construct.  Includes a placeholder for a parsing function.
* **API Reference Enhancement:**  Instead of just listing the constructs, considers creating a more structured API reference section with better organization.  The list is a problem that needs to be addressed and ideally should be organized and explained in detail.
* **Installation Instructions:**  Makes installation instructions more specific and user-friendly.
* **TypeScript:**  Explains type safety correctly, but it's not the core focus, so you can leave it as is.
* **Documentation Structure:**  Overall, the documentation is better organized and provides more context.


Remember to replace the `...` placeholders with the actual list of constructs and add details to the API Reference section.  Also, review the `security.md`, `contributing.md`, and other files within the micromark repo to include the relevant information.
