**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Integration:** The code now uses Selenium to simulate user interaction and load a page.  This is **essential** for testing JavaScript code that interacts with the browser.  Crucially, it's now using `about:blank` as a starting page (a blank page) to avoid unpredictable behavior.


2. **Asynchronous Handling:**  JavaScript's `chrome.tabs.query` and `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` are asynchronous. The `WebDriverWait` is critical for waiting for the asynchronous operations to complete.  This prevents "false negative" tests that incorrectly report success or failure because the test was run too early.


3. **Error Handling (Crucial):**  The `test_send_url_failure` now includes a strategy for simulating a failure in the background script. A real world test might involve mocking the response with a known failure case.


4. **Edge Case (`test_send_url_no_active_tab`):** Added a test to handle the case where there's no active tab, demonstrating proper error handling (Selenium should throw a `NoSuchElementException`).

5. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions check that the expected alerts (success or failure) are displayed.


6. **Data-Driven Testing:** The tests are designed to be more general-purpose.


**How to run these tests:**

1. **Install pytest and Selenium:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Install ChromeDriver:**
   ```bash
   pip install webdriver-manager
   #or, if using an older method
   # python -m pip install selenium
   # Download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
   #and place the downloaded executable in the correct location on your system. 
   #e.g., on Linux in /usr/bin
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_popup.py  # Replace test_popup.py with the name of your test file.
   ```


Remember to replace `"sendUrlButton"` with the actual ID of the button if it's different. Also, make sure to update the code in the backend JavaScript part to trigger the success or failure scenarios accordingly. This is important for the `test_send_url_failure` test to be effective. Remember to adapt the specific selector for the alert messages.
