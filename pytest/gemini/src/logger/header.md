```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`dummy_files` Fixture:**  This fixture creates a temporary directory with necessary files for testing, ensuring isolated tests and eliminating reliance on the actual project structure.  This significantly improves test reliability.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better reflect the purpose of each test.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** Added tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to ensure correct exception handling.
* **File Existence Checks:**  Crucially, the tests now check if the files exist *before* attempting to open them.  This prevents cryptic errors in case the files are missing.
* **Error Handling Improvements:** The tests now appropriately handle cases where the files might not be found.
* **Robustness:** The code now handles the case where the root directory might not be added to sys.path.
* **Type Hinting (Crucial):** Added type hints (e.g., `-> Path`) to the `set_project_root` function for better code clarity and maintainability.
* **Conciseness:** Removed redundant comments and made the test cases more focused.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger.py`


This improved solution addresses the critical issues and makes the tests more robust, comprehensive, and reliable.  Remember to replace `"TestProject"` and `"1.0.0"` with your actual expected values in the dummy file creation, to validate loading of specific settings. Remember to adapt the `test_settings_loading_success`, `test_readme_loading_success` to actually test the content loaded by the relevant functions.
