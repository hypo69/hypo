## Changes Made

- Added RST-style docstrings for `speech_recognizer` and `text2speech` functions, including detailed parameter descriptions, return values, and exception handling.
- Replaced `# ...` placeholders with more descriptive comments.
- Replaced `jjson`'s `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` with comments, following the instruction not to make changes to these parts.
- Corrected the usage of exceptions; replaced vague `except Exception as ex:` with specific exceptions where appropriate.
- Added robust error handling using `logger.error` for more detailed logging and informative error messages.
- Added a check for successful audio download in `speech_recognizer` to prevent potential issues.
- Improved variable naming and style.
