    :synopsis: Module for managing web drivers.

"""
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
from src.logger import logger

MODE = 'development'


#from .header import (gs,  __root__, __version__, __doc__, __details__, __project_name__, __author__, __copyright__, __cofee__) # TODO: Add imports from header if needed.
from .driver import Driver
from .chrome import Chrome
from .firefox import Firefox
from .edge import Edge
from .bs import BS
from .playwright import Playwright  # Fixed typo: Playwrid -> Playwright
from .crawlee_python import CrawleePython


```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module-level docstring in RST format.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Fixed the typo in import `Playwright`.
- Added `# TODO` comments where necessary.  The existing comments were left in place and labeled accordingly.
- The comments from the original code are preserved.
