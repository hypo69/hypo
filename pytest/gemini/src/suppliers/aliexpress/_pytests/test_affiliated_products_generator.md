**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for empty input to `check_and_process_affiliate_products` and `process_affiliate_products`, demonstrating handling of different scenarios.
* **Edge Case Handling:** Included an invalid URL in `prod_urls` to test the `process_affiliate_products` function's robustness to invalid input. The `ensure_https` side_effect patch now handles the different input types better. This is crucial for real-world applications.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  More descriptive assertions are used to validate the output of the `process_affiliate_products` function (checking length and content).
* **Mock Return Values:** The mock for `retrieve_product_details` now returns an empty list in the test case to handle the absence of product details. This is crucial for robustness, as a real-world API might not always return data.
* **Mocking External Dependencies:** Correctly mocked `save_png_from_url` and `save_video_from_url` to avoid actual file operations during testing.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary comments and improved code readability.
* **pytest.main():**  Ensured the script runs as a pytest test file.

This revised solution provides a more complete and robust set of tests that cover a wider range of possible scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions. Remember to adapt the `src` paths if necessary. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Importantly, replace `src.suppliers.aliexpress.affiliated_products_generator` with the actual path to the module if it's different.
