```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:** The crucial improvement is mocking `os.getcwd` within the test functions. This allows you to control the return value of `os.getcwd`, which is essential for testing `dir_root` calculation reliably, without depending on the actual current working directory of your system.


2. **Exception Handling:** `test_syspath_append_multiple_times` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (e.g., errors when appending the path multiple times)

3. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions in tests are made more explicit and informative to easily understand the expected results.


4. **Complete Test Cases:** The test suite now provides tests for  `dir_root` calculation,  demonstrating how to handle different scenarios and validate the expected behavior.  You need to add tests for other functions and classes from `src` based on their actual implementation.


**Before running these tests:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  Replace `/path/to/hypotez/project` with the actual path to your project.
* **Import necessary modules:**  Make sure you have all the necessary imports for the functions you're testing.



This revised solution provides a solid foundation for comprehensive testing of the `header.py` code, handling various scenarios and checking for correct function behavior. Remember to add more tests for other parts of your code as needed. Remember to adapt these tests to the exact functions and classes you need to test from the `src` modules.
