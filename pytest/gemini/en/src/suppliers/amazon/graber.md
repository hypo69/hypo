```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now mocks `Driver`, `Context`, and any other external dependencies. This isolates the tests and prevents them from interacting with the actual browser or external services.  This is *essential* for effective testing.  I've used `unittest.mock`.

2. **Mock Graber Class:** A `MockGraber` class is created to mock the `Graber` class's methods, especially `grab_page` which interacts with various `await self.*` calls.  Crucially, it now sets `self.fields` to a mock `ProductFields` object. This simulates the desired return from the function, making assertion easier.  The `id_product` method is mocked to avoid unnecessary external calls.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** The `test_grab_page_valid_input` and `test_grab_page_empty_input` are more focused and clearly define what they test.


4. **`@pytest.fixture`:** The `graber` fixture now returns a properly mocked `MockGraber` instance. This way, each test function can easily use the fixture without needing to instantiate the class.

5. **`asyncio.sleep(0)`:** Added `asyncio.sleep(0)` to `grab_page` to ensure that the function does not return before the mocked method calls are "finished."  This is essential for proper asynchronous test execution.


6. **Assertions:**  The assertions are now focused on ensuring the correct type and basic contents of the returned `ProductFields` object (which we assume from the original code to exist).


**How to Use:**

1. Install pytest:  `pip install pytest`

2. Replace the placeholder imports (`from src import ...`) with the actual imports from your project.

3. Run the tests: `pytest`


This revised solution addresses the critical issue of mocking dependencies and provides far more robust, isolated test cases.  The `MockGraber` class is a critical aspect, and the `pytest` setup handles the necessary asynchronous execution. Remember to adapt the `ProductFields` assertion to match the actual structure of that class if you have one. Remember that the actual assertion logic should use the correct criteria for checking the *real* ProductFields object returned from the graber.
