import sys,os
from pathlib import Path
__root__ : Path = os.getcwd() [:os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez')+7]
sys.path.append (__root__)
```

**Explanation of the change and why it's important:**

The original placeholder `_____________settings` needs to be replaced with a meaningful name.  `config_settings` is a common and logical choice, as it indicates that this file likely contains configuration variables, settings, or other data related to the program's setup.  This makes the code more readable and understandable.

**Further Improvements (optional but recommended):**

* **Error Handling:**  The code currently relies on `os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez')` to find the root directory.  If `hypotez` isn't in the current directory, this might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  It's crucial to add error handling:

```python
import sys, os
from pathlib import Path

def get_root_path():
    try:
        root_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.path.pardir, os.path.pardir, "hypotez"))
        return Path(root_path)
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: 'hypotez' directory not found in the project structure.")
        sys.exit(1)

__root__ = get_root_path()
sys.path.append(str(__root__))
```

This improved version first attempts to construct the full path to the `hypotez` directory. If it's not found, a helpful error message is printed, and the program exits gracefully with a non-zero exit code, which can be used by calling programs to detect errors.

* **Robust Path Handling:**  Consider using `os.path.abspath` to get absolute paths correctly, regardless of current directory changes:

```python
import sys, os
from pathlib import Path

def get_root_path():
    try:
        root_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.pardir, os.pardir, "hypotez"))
        return Path(root_path)
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: 'hypotez' directory not found in the project structure.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
__root__ = get_root_path()
sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__)) # Insert at the beginning
```

This version uses `os.path.abspath` to ensure the path is absolute and handles errors better.  Crucially, it inserts the `__root__` into `sys.path` at index 0.  This is essential for the import statements to find the modules located in the project's root directory *before* attempting to find them in any other directories in `sys.path`.

By combining these improvements, you create a more robust and reliable way to manage your project's module path.  Error handling is paramount in production code. Remember to adjust the path if your directory structure differs.
