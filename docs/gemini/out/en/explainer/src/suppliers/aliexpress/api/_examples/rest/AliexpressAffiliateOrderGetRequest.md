```

## <algorithm>

**Step 1**: Initialization

- The `__init__` method of the `AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest` class takes `domain` and `port` as arguments.
- It calls the `RestApi` constructor with these arguments, likely initializing common resources or configurations.
- It initializes three instance attributes: `app_signature`, `fields`, and `order_ids` to `None`.  These likely hold data related to API authentication, data fields to retrieve, and order IDs respectively, before any specific request is made.


**Step 2**: API Name Retrieval

- The `getapiname` method returns the string `'aliexpress.affiliate.order.get'`. This appears to be the name of the specific API endpoint to be invoked for retrieving affiliate order information.

```

**Dependencies Analysis**:

The mermaid diagram shows a relationship to `RestApi` class.  The `RestApi` class is likely in a `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/base.py` file, forming part of the Aliexpress API client library.


## <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `from ..base import RestApi`: This line imports the `RestApi` class from a parent directory (`..`) within the `base` module. This suggests a modular design, where the `RestApi` class provides a base implementation for interacting with APIs, potentially handling things like authentication or general request formatting.  It would be helpful to see the `RestApi` code to understand the functionality it provides.


**Classes:**

- `AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest`: This class extends the `RestApi` class, likely to add specific functionality related to retrieving affiliate order data from the AliExpress API.  The class defines an `__init__` method for setting up the connection and initializing the order and credentials, as well as a `getapiname` method to specify the API method to call. The absence of further methods suggests that this class primarily prepares the request configuration rather than handling the actual communication with the API.


**Functions:**

- `__init__(self, domain="api-sg.aliexpress.com", port=80)`: Initializes the object with a domain and port.  By default, it uses `api-sg.aliexpress.com` and port 80.  It is probable that this is intended for configuration for REST calls for accessing the AliExpress API and that other options are possible. The `RestApi` class would likely handle low-level networking (e.g., sending HTTP requests).
- `getapiname(self)`: This method returns the API endpoint name (e.g., `aliexpress.affiliate.order.get`). This is vital for specifying the correct API call to be made.

**Variables:**

- `app_signature`: Likely holds an API key or authorization token.
- `fields`: Potentially contains a list of fields to be returned in the API response. This allows filtering the data returned from the API, improving performance.
- `order_ids`: Likely contains a list of order IDs for which to retrieve information.

**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

- The code doesn't include the actual API calls.  It only defines the structure for preparing the request. This requires calling a method from the `RestApi` class.
- The `app_signature`, `fields`, and `order_ids` are not used directly in the code snippet provided.  A real-world implementation would use these attributes to populate the request.
- The lack of error handling (e.g., checking for invalid API keys or order IDs) is a potential issue.


**Relationship Chain:**

```
AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest <--- RestApi
                                  ^
                                  |__ potentially interacts with other modules related to request formatting and handling network requests
```

The `RestApi` class forms a critical link, acting as a base class for making API calls. This class is expected to contain logic to handle low-level details like forming requests to the specified domain and port, authentication, and handling the results of API calls.
