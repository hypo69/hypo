**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).

2. **Dummy File Creation/Deletion:** The tests now create dummy `pyproject.toml` files (and folders if needed) for testing purposes, ensuring that the files exist, and cleaning them up after the test is finished, preventing interference with other tests or the actual project. This crucial step was missing in the previous example.

3. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** The tests cover various scenarios, including valid input where the marker file is in the current directory, and  `pyproject.toml` in the parent directory.  It also now includes tests for the case where no marker files are found and the case where a marker file isn't found in any of the expected locations.


4. **`pytest.raises` (not needed for `set_project_root`):**  The original code did not have exceptions to catch, so `pytest.raises` is not used.

5. **Fixtures (not needed):** Fixtures are not needed for these test functions.

6. **Docstrings:** Added clear docstrings to each test function, describing the purpose and the scenario being tested.

7. **Robustness:** The tests are more robust by handling edge cases and potential issues, such as the marker file not existing, avoiding potential errors.

8. **Multiple Marker Files:** Added a test to cover the situation where multiple marker files are specified.


This revised solution provides a more thorough and reliable test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing the test file to execute the tests. Remember to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
