## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/fast_api/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/fast_api/__init__.py`, appears to be a module initialization file for a FastAPI application.  It sets a global variable `MODE` to 'dev'.

**Purpose:**

The file likely initializes configuration settings for the FastAPI application.  The `MODE` variable suggests a development mode.

**How to use:**

This file itself is likely not directly *used* by the user in a typical application workflow.  Instead, it's a foundational component that other files in the `fast_api` package (or modules that import it) will reference.

**Example of how to use (hypothetical):**

```python
from hypotez.src.fast_api import MODE

if MODE == 'dev':
    # Perform specific actions for development mode
    print("Running in development mode.")
    # ...your code for development-specific operations...
elif MODE == 'prod':
    # Perform actions for production mode
    print("Running in production mode.")
    # ...your code for production-specific operations...
else:
  print(f"Unknown mode: {MODE}.")
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Configuration:**  The `MODE` variable likely affects other parts of the application, including database connections, logging levels, or API endpoints.  Look for other configuration files or modules that reference and use this value.

* **Dependencies:**  This module likely depends on other packages or modules in the `hypotez` project.

* **Best practices:**  Consider using a dedicated configuration module (e.g., `config.py`) to centralize configuration variables, improving maintainability and readability. This is a good practice as it avoids magic strings and makes the application more flexible.


**Further steps if you want to use this file:**

1. **Identify usage:**  Investigate how other files in the `fast_api` package use the `MODE` variable.
2. **Understand dependencies:**  Determine what other modules or packages are necessary for this file to work correctly.
3. **Customize for your needs:**  Modify the `MODE` variable (or its handling) to meet your specific requirements, whether for development, testing, or production.
