**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `__file__`:** The crucial change is mocking `__file__` using `unittest.mock.patch`. This prevents the test from attempting to read files in the project directory, making it independent and reproducible.  This is essential for testing code that's finding project roots.

2. **Temporary Directory:** The test now creates a temporary directory structure to simulate a project. This ensures the test doesn't interact with the actual project structure, and is deleted at the end. This is a much better approach than relying on pre-existing project files.

3. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions now explicitly check for the expected `root_path`.

4. **Edge Case:** `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` is added to handle the case where no marker files are found in parent directories.  This is a critical edge case.

5. **Robustness:** The code now handles the case where marker files aren't present in the parent directories.  This ensures the function returns the correct result when marker files are missing.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the above test code in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `header.py`.
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution addresses the previous limitations and creates more reliable and comprehensive tests for `set_project_root`. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` tuple in the test function to match the expected structure you're testing against. Also, if there are other functions in `header.py`, add tests for them as well.
