```

**Changes Made**

- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Added missing imports for `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns`.
- Implemented a `load_payload` function to load the payload from a JSON file.
- Added `try-except` blocks with appropriate error handling using `logger.error`.
- Added docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format to the `load_payload` function and the module.
- Added empty `# ...` placeholders to signify areas needing future development.
- Removed unused shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python`).
- Improved variable naming to enhance code readability.
