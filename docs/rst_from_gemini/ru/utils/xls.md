Module: src.utils.xls

Converter for Excel (`xls`/`xlsx`) to JSON and JSON to Excel (`xls`/`xlsx`).
This module provides functions to convert Excel files to JSON format, handle multiple sheets, and save JSON data back to Excel files.  It includes robust error handling and logging.

Functions:
    read_xls_as_dict(xls_file: str, json_file: str = None, sheet_name: Union[str, int] = None) -> Union[Dict, List[Dict], bool]:
        Reads an Excel file and converts it to JSON.  Optionally, converts a specific sheet and saves the result to a JSON file.  Handles errors gracefully.  Supports both `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.

    save_xls_file(data: Dict[str, List[Dict]], file_path: str) -> bool:
        Saves JSON data to an Excel file.  The data should be a dictionary where keys are sheet names and values are lists of dictionaries representing rows. Handles errors gracefully.  Supports both `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.

Examples:
    # Reading and optionally saving to JSON (using xlsx)
    data = read_xls_as_dict('input.xlsx', 'output.json', 'Sheet1')
    if data:
        print(data)

    # Saving from JSON data (using xlsx)
    data_to_save = {'Sheet1': [{'column1': 'value1', 'column2': 'value2'}]}
    success = save_xls_file(data_to_save, 'output.xlsx')
    if success:
        print("Successfully saved to output.xlsx")

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The `read_xls_as_dict` function now has more comprehensive error handling. It catches `FileNotFoundError` specifically and logs exceptions using `logging.exception()`. This provides detailed error messages, making debugging much easier.
* **Logging:** The code uses `logging.exception` for exceptions in both functions. This is essential for proper debugging: it logs the full traceback, which is crucial for identifying where and why an error occurred.
* **File Logging:**  A log file `xls_converter.log` is created in the same directory as the script.  The `filemode='a'` argument ensures that each run appends to the log file, making it easier to track changes over time.  This is vastly better than console-only logging.
* **`xlsxwriter`:** The `save_xls_file` function now uses `xlsxwriter` as the engine for writing Excel files. This is crucial for handling more complex formatting scenarios and is now the recommended method for writing Excel files with pandas.
* **Type Hinting:** The type hinting is kept, as it's good practice.
* **File Existence Check:**  A crucial check for existence of the `xls_file` now exists in the `read_xls_as_dict`. This is crucial for robust code.
* **Clearer Docstrings:** The docstrings now explicitly mention handling both `.xls` and `.xlsx` file extensions.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter
    ```

2.  **Save:** Save the updated code as `xls.py` in your `hypotez/src/utils` directory.

3.  **Run:**  Run your code that calls the `read_xls_as_dict` and `save_xls_file` functions. You'll see the logs detailing success or failure (and specific errors) in the `xls_converter.log` file.


This revised solution is more robust, easier to debug, and provides better error information, as well as appropriate file logging. Remember to adapt the file paths in your calling code to match your project's structure.
