# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/etzmaleh/header.py`

This file, `header.py`, initializes essential project information and sets up the Python environment. It's crucial for correctly locating project resources and imports.

## Key Functions and Variables

* **`set_project_root(marker_files=...) -> Path`:**
    * **Purpose:** Locates the project root directory.  It searches upward from the current file's directory until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
    * **Args:**
        * `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names used to identify the project root.  Defaults to a set of common project markers.
    * **Returns:**
        * A `pathlib.Path` object representing the project root directory. Also adds the root directory to `sys.path`.  This allows the code to import modules from within the project.
    * **Important:**  Crucially, if the root directory isn't found, it defaults to the directory of the script itself.


* **`__root__`:**
    * **Purpose:** A `pathlib.Path` object containing the path to the project root.  Initialized by calling `set_project_root()`.
    * **Usage:** Used throughout the file to access project resources.
    * **Note:**  This variable is crucial; its value determines where the script looks for important files like `settings.json` and `README.MD`.


* **`settings`:**
    * **Purpose:** A Python dictionary containing project settings loaded from `settings.json` located in the project's `src` directory.
    * **Initialization:** Attempts to load data from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json'`.  Uses a `try...except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions gracefully.
    * **Use:** Provides project-specific data (e.g., `project_name`, `version`, `author`).


* **`doc_str`:**
    * **Purpose:** Stores the content of the project's `README.MD` file.
    * **Initialization:** Reads the content from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'README.MD'`. Handles potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.
    * **Use:**  Likely used to provide documentation or help information about the project.


* **`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:**
    * **Purpose:** Store project metadata. These variables collect project name, version, documentation, details, author, copyright, and a link to support the developer (useful for open-source projects).
    * **Initialization:** Get values from the loaded `settings` dictionary if available, or use default values if `settings` is not available.
    * **Use:**  This metadata often appears in project-related displays and documentation.

## How to Use

1. **Project Structure:** Ensure your project has a directory structure containing `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`, `src/settings.json`, and `src/README.MD`.

2. **Import:** This file (`header.py`) should be imported in other modules within the project (e.g., `from src.suppliers.etzmaleh import header`).

3. **Access Data:** After import, the metadata like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, and `doc_str` will be accessible.

## Troubleshooting

* **Missing files:** If `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing, the corresponding variables (`settings`, `doc_str`) will be `None`, leading to errors if you try to use them without checking for `None`. Use `if settings:` or similar checks.
* **Import Errors:** Check that the `gs` module (which is used in this script) is correctly installed and imported in the same file if this function isn't found, as its functionality is required.  Verify that the `sys.path` modification in `set_project_root` is working as expected.

This guide helps you understand the purpose and use of `header.py` within your project. Remember to adapt and expand upon this guide as you use and modify the code.
