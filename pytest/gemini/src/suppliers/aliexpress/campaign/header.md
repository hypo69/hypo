**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `gs` and `sys` modules. This is crucial for isolating the tests and preventing them from depending on the actual file system or external modules.  The `MockGs` and `MockSys` classes are created.

2. **Error Handling:** Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are included in the `test_settings_file_not_found` and `test_settings_file_invalid_json` function to test the error handling in the script.

3. **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:**  New tests cover various scenarios like:
   - A `pyproject.toml` file in a subdirectory.
   - Cases where no marker file is found.
   - A marker file in the parent directory.
   - Multiple marker files.
   - Ensuring that `sys.path` modification is handled correctly in `set_project_root`.

4. **File cleanup:** The tests now delete the mock files created to avoid conflicts between tests and leave the system in a predictable state.

5. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive and accurately reflect the test's purpose.

6. **Structure:** The test structure is aligned with the example provided.

7. **pytest.raises (optional):** `pytest.raises` isn't strictly necessary for these tests since the script's error handling isn't directly throwing exceptions outside the `try...except` blocks; therefore, exception testing is omitted from the test_function_1 and test_function_2 examples.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive test suite for the `header.py` file. Remember to adjust the file paths (`pyproject.toml`, `settings.json`, `README.MD`) in the test code if your project structure differs. Remember to install the pytest library (`pip install pytest`). Also note the use of `Path` objects throughout, as these are the recommended way to handle file paths in Python 3.
