```

**Changes and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now properly catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Crucially, it prints a warning message to the console indicating the error.  This is *much* better than silently failing.  The original code did not provide feedback.
* **Default Settings:**  The `settings = {}` line inside the `except` block is a good addition.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, `settings` is now an empty dictionary. This prevents `AttributeError` later in the code if you try to access keys that don't exist.  The original code left some variables potentially undefined if the file couldn't be loaded, which is a significant bug.
* **Corrected Typo:**  `__copyrihgnt__` was changed to `__copyright__`.
* **Removed Unnecessary `if settings`:** The `if settings` blocks are now unnecessary since the default values are already set.  This makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.

**Why these changes matter:**

* **Robustness:** The error handling prevents the script from crashing if `settings.json` is not found or invalid.  This is critical for production-level code.
* **Maintainability:** The cleaner code is easier to understand and modify.
* **Feedback:** The warning message helps developers to diagnose issues related to `settings.json`.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://another-place-to-donate.com"
}
```

This improved version is significantly more reliable and informative in case of problems. Remember to place the `settings.json` file in the correct location relative to your `version.py` file (one directory up in this case). Remember to handle exceptions properly.
