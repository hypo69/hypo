**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` object and `execute_locator` method. This isolates the tests from the actual WebDriver and avoids dependency issues.  This is fundamental for reliable testing of the Graber class.

2. **Fixtures:** `mock_driver` and `graber` fixtures are now defined to properly set up the test environment.  Fixtures are crucial for creating reusable test setup and teardown.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** The tests have descriptive names, like `test_graber_init_mobile`, helping understand their purpose.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests are added for different URLs (mobile, desktop) and for the `__init__` method's behavior under various conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:** The tests now explicitly include an `test_graber_init_incorrect_url` case.

6. **Locator Loading:** The test for correct locator loading (`test_locator_loading_mobile`) now uses the mock.


**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

- **Exception Handling:** The provided `graber` class does not have much logic.  Tests for exceptions within the decorator (and any other methods that call external functions) are crucial and need to be included as shown in the example `test_close_pop_up_decorator` placeholder.

- **`src.logger` mocking:** You'll need to mock `logger` from `src.logger` to test any logging statements within the decorator and other parts of the code.  Add a `caplog` fixture for comprehensive logging assertion in your tests.

- **Context:**  The `Context` class and its `locator` and `driver` attributes will need appropriate mocking in the test setup.

- **`j_loads_ns`:**  You might need to mock the behavior of `j_loads_ns` if it has dependencies that you want to isolate during testing.

- **Dependencies:** Make sure your tests import all necessary modules from the file, especially those used by the functions being tested.  The example has been amended to do this.

- **Complete `close_pop_up` Test:** The test of the `close_pop_up` decorator needs mocking of the `execute_locator` call and proper handling of exceptions and any other internal logic.



By addressing these points, you can create more robust and reliable tests for the given code. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific behavior of the `close_pop_up` decorator and any other functions or methods that it interacts with. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already.
