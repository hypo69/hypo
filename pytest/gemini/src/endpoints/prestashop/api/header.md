```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mocks:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create mock `settings.json` and `README.MD` files, making the tests more independent and easier to manage.  This is crucial for testing the `try...except` blocks.

* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Testing:** Added tests for various scenarios:
    * Existing file in current directory.
    * Missing file (tests handling).
    * Multiple marker files.
    * Marker files in parent directories (critical edge case).
    *  Multiple levels of parent directories (more comprehensive)

* **Error Handling Tests:**  Added tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to verify exception handling.

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `__root__` is replaced with more descriptive names like `root_path` in the test functions.

* **Import Fix:**  Fixed an issue with the import statements for `header` within the tests, which was causing problems when the `import` was moved inside the functions.

* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from pytest is used to create temporary directories for the tests, avoiding conflicts and ensuring clean test environments.

* **`mock_gs_path`:** This fixture correctly sets up a mock `gs.path.root` for testing the file loading sections.

* **Simplified Assertions:** Assertions are made more concise and readable.

* **Docstrings:** Added or improved docstrings for better understanding of the tests' purpose and logic.

These improvements make the tests more robust, comprehensive, and easier to understand and maintain.  They are crucial for ensuring the code behaves correctly in various situations, including when files might be missing or have unexpected formats. Remember to install `pytest` and any necessary dependencies using pip before running these tests.


```bash
pip install pytest
