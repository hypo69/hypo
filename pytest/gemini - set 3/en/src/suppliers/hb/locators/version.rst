**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better reflect the test's purpose.

2. **Comprehensive Checks:** Added tests for the type (`isinstance`), ensuring that `__version__` is a string.  Crucially, added tests for the version's *content*—checking that it's not empty and has the expected minimum number of parts, if the version string format has structure (e.g., `major.minor.patch`).

3. **Edge Case Testing:** An example of an edge case is added—checking for leading zeros or other patterns in the version string. Modify this test to match the expected versioning scheme in your code.

4. **Exception Handling (commented out):** DemonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions. The example is commented out since the original code doesn't appear to raise exceptions for valid inputs.  Uncomment and modify if exception handling is present.


**How to Use and Adapt:**

* **Versioning Pattern:**  Replace the example version checks (e.g., `len(parts) >= 5`) with the actual format expected for your `__version__` string.  If your version string uses hyphens, periods, or other characters instead of dots, adjust the tests accordingly.   Knowing the expected version format is vital.

* **Edge Cases:**  Add specific edge cases relevant to your project's needs, such as checks for versions with leading zeros or versions with unusual format components.  These will be specific to the way your code is meant to handle version numbers.

* **Exception Handling:** If your code raises exceptions in the function under test, uncomment the exception handling example and adjust it to test the expected exceptions and error messages.

* **Run the tests:**  Use `pytest` to run the tests in your terminal:  `pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/locators/`.

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage, ensuring that the version handling in your `version.py` file is robust and correct. Remember that thorough testing depends on a clear understanding of your `__version__` format and the expected behavior of your code. Remember to replace placeholders with actual version format details from your code.
