**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The crucial change is mocking `Driver` and `Chrome`.  This isolates the `FacebookPromoter` from external dependencies like web interactions, which would be unpredictable and slow in a testing environment.
* **`mock_driver` Fixture:** Creates a mock `Driver` object, allowing tests to interact with it without actually launching a browser.
* **`mock_facebook_promoter` Fixture:** Sets up a mock `FacebookPromoter` object, passing the mock driver. This keeps the test setup cleaner and more readable.
* **Clearer Test Cases:** Tests are now more focused on specific aspects (valid input, empty input, exception).
* **Exception Handling Test:** Added a test to check if the `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` block is handling exceptions correctly, using `pytest.raises`. This now also simulates an exception within the `time.sleep()` call. This is a crucial improvement to test robustness.
* **Empty input test:** Added a test to verify the behavior with an empty `campaigns` list as an input to `run_campaigns`.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the above test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_start_posting.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_start_posting.py
    ```

This revised solution is much more comprehensive, realistic, and effective in testing the `start_posting` code. Remember to adapt the mocks to match the actual implementation of your classes if they change.
