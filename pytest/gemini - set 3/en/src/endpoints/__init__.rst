```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.endpoints as endpoints


# Tests for endpoints module (assuming no functions are exported)
#  Since the provided code only imports modules and defines constants, there are no functions to test.


# Example testing if the MODE constant is set correctly.
def test_mode_constant():
    """Tests if the MODE constant is defined and has a value."""
    assert endpoints.MODE is not None
    assert isinstance(endpoints.MODE, str)  #Ensure it's a string
    # Add further assertion if you want to check the specific expected value:
    # assert endpoints.MODE == 'dev' 
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code snippet only imports modules and defines a constant.  There are no functions to test directly.  Therefore, the example test above only checks if the `MODE` constant exists and is a string.

**Crucial Missing Information:**

To write meaningful tests, we need the actual functions and classes defined within the modules imported (`PrestaShop`, `PrestaCategory`, etc.).  These would likely have methods that could be tested.  For example:

```python
# Example (Hypothetical) Function in PrestaShop
class PrestaShop:
    def get_products(self, category_id):
        # ... (Implementation details)
        if category_id < 0:
           raise ValueError("Category ID cannot be negative")
        return []  # Example return
```

**Example Tests for Hypothetical `PrestaShop` Class:**

```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.endpoints as endpoints

# Assuming 'PrestaShop' exists in the imported modules
# ... (Previous test for MODE constant remains the same)

def test_get_products_valid_input(example_presta_shop_instance):
    """Tests get_products with valid category ID."""
    category_id = 10  # Example category ID
    products = example_presta_shop_instance.get_products(category_id)
    assert isinstance(products, list)  # Check the return type

def test_get_products_invalid_input(example_presta_shop_instance):
    """Tests get_products with invalid category ID (negative)."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Category ID cannot be negative"):
        example_presta_shop_instance.get_products(-1)


@pytest.fixture
def example_presta_shop_instance():
    """Creates a PrestaShop instance for testing."""
    # Replace this with the actual instantiation using parameters 
    # Example:
    #return endpoints.PrestaShop(db_connection_details)
    return endpoints.PrestaShop()
```


**To create comprehensive tests, you need to provide:**

1. **The actual code:**  The functions and classes within the imported modules (`PrestaShop`, etc.).  This is absolutely crucial.
2. **Example data and possible return values:**  What kind of data do the methods expect and return?  This helps in creating meaningful test cases.
3. **Edge cases:**  What are the unusual inputs that the functions should handle correctly (e.g., empty lists, specific numerical values, special characters)?

With the actual code, you can generate precise and valuable test cases, demonStarting appropriate usage of `pytest.raises` for exception handling and other pytest features like fixtures for dependency injection.
