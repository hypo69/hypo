**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Created `mock_project_root` to create a temporary directory structure for testing. This isolates the tests, prevents interference between them, and avoids relying on the actual project structure. `mock_project_root_missing_marker_file` is introduced to test when marker files are missing.

2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

3. **Edge Cases:**  Added a test (`test_set_project_root_missing_marker_file`) to handle the case where the marker files are not present. Added `test_set_project_root_current_dir` to check for the scenario where no marker file is found anywhere.

4. **Exception Handling:**  Tests are written to ensure appropriate behavior for valid and invalid inputs.

5. **pytest.raises (crucial):** I've added `pytest.raises` to test exception handling, but this requires you to specify the exact exception you expect (`FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are included in the examples, for example).


6. **Removing Temporary Files:**  Critically, I added `os.remove(...)` statements to clean up the created temporary directories after each test. This prevents build-up of test files and keeps the test environment clean.


7. **sys.path Handling:** The code now correctly handles adding the project root to `sys.path`. Added test to clear `sys.path` before each test to make sure the tests are independent of each other.


**How to Run:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest -v test_header.py  # Replace test_header.py with your test file name
    ```

**Further Considerations:**

-   **Comprehensive Testing:** Add more test cases for `set_project_root` covering more variations in the input `marker_files`.
-   **Settings File:** You may want to create a mock `settings.json` to test the related parts of the `header.py` code.
-   **README.MD File:**  Similarly, for the `doc_str` handling, create a mock `README.MD` file.


Remember to replace placeholders like `test_header.py` with the actual name of your test file. Remember to install `packaging` if you don't already have it. This revised example provides a strong foundation for comprehensive testing of the `set_project_root` function.
