**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`_clean` function improvement:**
    * **Handles `None` values:**  Now correctly handles cases where `content` is `None`.  Returning an empty string (`""`) prevents errors.
    * **Explicit type conversion:**  Forces `content` to a string using `str(content)` before any further processing, which is crucial.  This prevents unexpected behavior if the input is not already a string.
    * **Removed unnecessary encoding:** The old encoding attempt was not needed and sometimes problematic.


* **Corrected `get_data` function:**
    * **Corrected key:** Changed `StringNormalizerippet` to `featured_snippet` to align with the name used in the method.  This is vital for data consistency and correct retrieval later in the code.


* **Consistent use of `str()`:**
    * Throughout the code, ensure that any values that might be of different data types are cast to string using `str()`. This improves robustness.


* **Comments & Docstrings:** Added some helpful comments and clarified some parts in the existing docstrings.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:** Handling `None` values and ensuring proper string type prevents crashes.
* **Data consistency:** Using `str()` conversion makes the code more reliable by ensuring the correct data type for further processing.
* **Readability and Maintainability:**  Corrected variable names and added comments enhance the code's clarity.

**How to use the improved code:**

```python
import requests
from lxml import etree  # Use etree for better XML handling

# Example usage (replace with your actual search query and user-agent)
search_query = "python programming language"
user_agent = "desktop"

try:
    response = requests.get(f"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_query}", headers={'User-Agent': 'your_user_agent'})  # Replace with your real user agent.
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    parser = GoogleHtmlParser(response.text, user_agent)
    results = parser.get_data()
    print(results)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error during request: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during parsing: {e}")

```

Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install requests lxml
```

Replace `"your_user_agent"` with a valid user agent string.  Using a proper user-agent is crucial to avoid Google's anti-scraping measures.  You might need to adjust the `user_agent` parameter according to Google's policies.
