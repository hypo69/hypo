How to use the `get_list_products_in_category` function
=========================================================

Description
-------------------------
This function retrieves a list of product URLs from a given category page on a website.  It handles potential pagination by automatically scrolling through the page and checking for the next page.  Crucially, it uses a `Supplier` object to interact with the web page, providing a consistent interface across different suppliers.  It also employs logging for debugging and error messages.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The function receives a `Supplier` object (`s`) as input. This object encapsulates the necessary information and methods for interacting with the specific supplier's website.  It also uses locators, likely from the `Supplier` or a related class, to identify the elements required to navigate the category page.

2. **Webdriver interaction:** The function utilizes the `Driver` object (`d`) associated with the `Supplier` to navigate and interact with the webpage. The code waits for one second, handles potential banner pop-ups, and scrolls the page down, potentially encountering more products.

3. **Finding initial products:** The function uses the `execute_locator` method of the `Driver` object, looking for a locator (`l['product_links']`) associated with product links on the page. This extracts the initial list of product URLs.

4. **Error Handling (No Products):** If no product links are found, a warning is logged, and the function returns `None` (or an appropriate empty list, based on expected return).

5. **Pagination handling (while loop):** The code enters a `while` loop to check if there are more pages of products. It uses the `current_url` and `previous_url` of the `Driver` to detect if it has moved to a new page.

   - **Pagination check (`paginator` function):**  Inside the `while` loop, the `paginator` function is called to check for the next page. If the next page is found, the product URLs from the next page are appended to the `list_products_in_category`. If not, the loop breaks.

6. **Data Handling:** The function ensures the `list_products_in_category` is a list, even if a single string was returned (a single product url on a page with no pagination).

7. **Logging:** The function logs the number of items found in the specified category, giving the user feedback on progress.

8. **Return value:** The function returns the `list_products_in_category` containing the URLs of all the products found on the category page.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
from src.suppliers.kualastyle.category import get_list_products_in_category
from src.suppliers import Supplier  # Assuming this class exists
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver  # Assuming this class exists


# Example instantiation (replace with actual instantiation)
supplier_obj = Supplier("some_supplier_details")  # Replace with your actual supplier data
driver = Driver()  # Replace with your actual driver instantiation
supplier_obj.driver = driver

# Example usage
list_of_product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier_obj)

if list_of_product_urls:
    for url in list_of_product_urls:
        print(f"Product URL: {url}")
else:
    print("No product URLs found.")
```
```
```
```python
