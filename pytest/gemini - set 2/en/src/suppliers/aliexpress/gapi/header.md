**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures to mock the contents of `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  This is crucial for isolating tests from external files and controlling the data.  `mock_gs_path` is important to mock `gs.path.root`  to control the expected directory. This makes the tests more robust.


2. **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Importantly, I used `pytest.tmp_path`.  This creates a temporary directory for each test.  This isolates the tests and prevents file conflicts.


3. **Mocking for Robustness:**  Using `monkeypatch` to mock `gs.path.root` allows you to test scenarios where `gs.path.root` points to different directories without needing to modify the actual `gs` module.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Added tests to cover:
   - Valid and invalid file inputs (using `tmp_path`)
   - Correct handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
   - Edge cases where the marker files are in the parent directory.
   -  The case where `settings` or `doc_str` are `None` (handling no files)

5. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions now directly check the expected values (e.g., `assert project_root == tmp_path`, `assert settings == mock_settings_json`).

6. **Error Handling:** Added tests specifically for exception handling (`FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`).

7. **Robustness Against Missing Files:**  The `try...except` blocks in the original code are preserved in the tests. The test `test_settings_loading_failure` ensures appropriate handling of a missing file, and `test_settings_loading_success` tests the correct behavior when the file exists.


8. **System Path Test:** Included `test_set_project_root_syspath_addition`. This checks that `set_project_root` correctly adds the project root to `sys.path`.

This revised solution provides a much more complete and robust set of test cases, crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the `set_project_root` function, especially in different scenarios. Remember to install the necessary packages (`pytest`, `packaging`) if you haven't already.  Also ensure your `gs` module is correctly imported and usable within your test environment.

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
