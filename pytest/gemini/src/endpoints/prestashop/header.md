**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for better isolation:**  Crucially, the code now uses `@pytest.fixture` to create a temporary project directory (`example_project_root`). This ensures each test runs in a clean environment, avoiding issues with shared state or leftover files.  The `example_settings_json` fixture aids in testing the settings loading.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more explicit about the test conditions.

3. **Edge Case Tests:** Added tests for cases where the marker file isn't found (returning the current directory), multiple marker files are present, and the marker file is in a parent directory.

4. **Error Handling:** The provided `try...except` blocks were preserved, but the `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file` now uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to efficiently check multiple cases where the marker file doesn't exist or is wrong.

5. **`monkeypatch` for sys.path:**  The `test_set_project_root_already_in_syspath` now uses `monkeypatch` to modify the `sys.path` fixture without changing the actual `sys.path`. This is crucial for testing that the code does not modify `sys.path` if the root is already there.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test suite now covers a wider range of scenarios, including different locations of the marker file and scenarios with invalid inputs or no marker files found.

7. **Concise Assertions:** The assertions are now more concise, focusing on checking the expected result of the function.

8. **Error Handling:** The code now explicitly checks for `TypeError` exceptions, which can be raised if the `marker_file` is incorrectly formatted or invalid.

9. **pytest.raises:** This is *not* needed for the `set_project_root` function because it doesn't raise exceptions for cases of a non-existent marker file.  We test for expected behavior, not error handling within the function, instead using assertions to ensure the correct directory is returned when the files aren't there.


This significantly improved test suite provides more confidence that the `set_project_root` function behaves correctly in various situations. Remember to install `pytest` and the `packaging` library if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
