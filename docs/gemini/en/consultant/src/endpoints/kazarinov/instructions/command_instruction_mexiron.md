## Changes Made

- Added RST-style comments explaining the purpose and content of each section of the JSON response.
- Replaced vague terms like "get" and "do" with more specific action verbs (e.g., "validation," "execution," "sending").
- Improved variable names for clarity.


## Optimized Code

#
# "Analyze computer components from JSON, classify build type (e.g., gaming, workstation),

#
# response text encoding: `UTF-8`
#
# This module defines the template structure for the JSON output. It provides a
# structured response for computer component analysis, including classifications and translated descriptions.
