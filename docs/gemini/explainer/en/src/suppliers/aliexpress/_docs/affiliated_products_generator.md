## `affiliated_products_generator.py` Overview


The `affiliated_products_generator.py` file contains the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class. This class is responsible for generating complete product data from the Aliexpress Affiliate API. It builds on the `AliApi` class to process product URLs or IDs and retrieve details about affiliate products, including saving images, videos, and JSON data.

#### Methods


##### `process_affiliate_products`


```python
def process_affiliate_products(self, prod_urls: List[str]) -> List[SimpleNamespace]:
    """
    Processes a list of URLs and returns a list of products with affiliate links and saved images.

    :param prod_urls: List of product URLs or IDs.
    :return: List of processed products.
    """
    # ... (implementation details omitted for brevity)
```


##### `delete_product`


```python
def delete_product(self, product_id: str, exc_info: bool = False):
    """ Delete a product that does not have an affiliate link"""
    # ... (implementation details omitted for brevity)
```


<algorithm>

**Step 1:** Input: `prod_urls` (list of product URLs or IDs)

**Step 2:**  `ensure_https`: Convert all URLs to HTTPS. Example: `['http://example.com/123', '456']` -> `['https://example.com/123', '456']`

**Step 3:** Iterate through `prod_urls`:
    * **Step 3.1:** Get affiliate link using `super().get_affiliate_links(prod_url)`. Example: `prod_url='https://example.com/123'` -> `_link` object containing promotion_link
    * **Step 3.2:** Check if `_link` is valid (contains `promotion_link`).
        * If valid: append `_link.promotion_link` to `_promotion_links` and `prod_url` to `_prod_urls`. Log a success message.
        * If invalid (not an affiliate): Log an info message.

**Step 4:** Check if `_promotion_links` is empty.
    * If empty: Log an error and return.

**Step 5:** Retrieve product details for URLs in `_prod_urls` using `self.retrieve_product_details(_prod_urls)`. Example `_prod_urls=['https://example.com/123']` -> `_affiliate_products` object containing product details.

**Step 6:** Iterate through `_affiliate_products` and `_promotion_links` simultaneously:
    * **Step 6.1:** Check if `promotion_link` exists for the corresponding product.
        * If not: parse URL and extract `aff_short_key`. Create a new promotion link. If `aff_short_key` does not exist, delete the product and log a message.
        * If exists: use the promotion link from `_promotion_links`.

    * **Step 6.2:** Save product image to `campaign_path/images/`.
    * **Step 6.3:** Save product video to `campaign_path/videos/` if available.
    * **Step 6.4:** Save product data as JSON to `campaign_path/locale/` (e.g., `campaign_path/EN_USD/product123.json`). Log a success message.
    * **Step 6.5:** If any step fails, log a warning message.

**Step 7:** Return `_affiliate_products`.

<explanation>

**Imports:**

- The imports are crucial for various functionalities.  `asyncio` enables asynchronous operations, `itertools` for efficient iteration, `math` for potential calculations, `pathlib` for file system path handling, `typing` for type hinting, `urllib.parse` for URL parsing, and `SimpleNamespace` for creating structured objects. Libraries like `gs` (`src.settings`),  `AliApi`, `Aliexpress`,  `AffiliateLinksShortener`, `extract_prod_ids`, `ensure_https`, `csv2dict`, `j_dumps`, `save_png_from_url`, `save_video_from_url`, `pprint`, `read_text_file`, `save_text_file`, from  `src.utils`, `src.logger`, etc. contribute to the API interactions, data conversion, saving of files and logs. This shows a strong dependency structure where the project has well-defined modules and functions that handle various operations from image saving, data extraction to log management.  The `src` prefix signifies a self-contained package structure.

**Classes:**

- `AliAffiliatedProducts`: This class extends `AliApi` and focuses on gathering product details from AliExpress.  Its attributes (`campaign_name`, `campaign_path`, etc.) define the context for the specific campaign. Its methods (`process_affiliate_products`, `delete_product`) implement the core logic for processing URLs, retrieving product data, and saving files in the appropriate campaign directory.  It shows a clear separation of concerns, with the logic of handling affiliate links and saving the product data being distinct from that of the parent class `AliApi`.  


**Functions:**

- `process_affiliate_products`: This function is the core processing logic, handling affiliate link retrieval, product data retrieval, and local saving of images/videos/JSON data.  It uses several external libraries and helpers for these tasks. The `SimpleNamespace` return structure is appropriate to encapsulate product attributes.  The use of `pprint` for logging provides easy debugging and monitoring of the process. It demonstrates well-structured code, employing error handling and logging mechanisms to enhance robustness.

- `delete_product`: Handles situations where affiliate links are unavailable. It's crucial in maintaining data consistency and preventing errors due to invalid data. It reads and updates files related to the campaign products.

**Variables:**

- `prod_urls`: A list of product URLs or IDs is the main input for processing.
- `_promotion_links`, `_prod_urls`, `_affiliate_products`: Internal variables to store results, intermediary data, or processed data, showcasing appropriate usage of variables for data flow within the function. `campaign_path`: dynamic path based on the campaign name.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

- **Error Handling**: While error handling (e.g., `exc_info=False`) is present, consider more specific exception handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to deal with potential issues like invalid URLs, network problems, or issues with saving files.  The `logger` is a crucial part of error handling and monitoring.

- **Asynchronous Operations:** For a large number of product URLs, the code could benefit from asynchronous requests using `asyncio` to improve performance and avoid blocking the main thread.

- **Input Validation:** Robust input validation for `prod_urls` would prevent unexpected behavior.


**Relationships:**

The code exhibits a clear dependency on various modules under `src`. The `AliApi` class likely handles lower-level API interactions with the AliExpress Affiliate API. `gs.path.google_drive`,  shows that this code may interact with Google Drive for storage.  `save_png_from_url` and other `save...` functions hint at image and video processing libraries being used. `csv2json` suggests data processing from CSV files is necessary for this workflow.  The overall project structure seems to involve data gathering, processing, and saving in a structured way.
