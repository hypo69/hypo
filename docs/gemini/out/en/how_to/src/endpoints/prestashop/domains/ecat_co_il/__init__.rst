How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file (`__init__.py`) is part of a larger PrestaShop integration, likely for a specific domain (`ecat_co_il`). It defines a variable `MODE` with the value 'dev'.  This variable likely controls the operating mode (e.g., development, production) of the PrestaShop integration or endpoint. It also contains numerous multiline strings that seem to be documentation comments using reStructuredText syntax.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file sets a variable `MODE` to the string value 'dev'.
2. The file contains extensive docstrings and comments, but these do not affect the execution flow, their purpose is for documentation and to clarify the functionality of the module.
3.  The file imports no external modules, and only defines a single variable.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No direct usage of this file as a standalone block.
    # To use the 'MODE' variable, you would import this file and access it as a module attribute.


    # Example assuming 'ecat_co_il' is a package or module:
    import ecat_co_il

    mode = ecat_co_il.MODE
    print(mode)  # Output: dev
