Module for code processing and documentation generation.
=========================================================

This module contains the `CodeProcessor` class, which is used to analyze and process code files.  It interacts with various AI models for code analysis and documentation generation.

Example Usage
--------------------

    result = processor.process_files(['file1.py', 'file2.py'])

# Changes Made

- Added RST-style docstrings to the module, class, and method.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (from `src.utils.jjson`).
- Added error handling using `logger.error` instead of `try-except` blocks for better error logging and reduced code duplication.
- Improved variable and function names.
- Added import statement for `os` to handle file system operations.
- Implemented basic error handling for missing files.
- Included more detailed comments with RST style to explain the code functionality.
