**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock `Driver`, `Context`, and potentially other classes and functions.  This is crucial for testing asynchronous code without needing a real browser.

2. **`MockDriver` and `MockContext`:**  These mock the necessary methods for testing.  The `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are essential to ensure proper cleanup of resources.

3. **`MockGraber`:** This class inherits from `Grbr` and mocks the necessary methods for testing.  It's much cleaner than patching individual methods.  Importantly, it now initializes `self.fields` in `grab_page`, which is essential for assertions.

4. **`@pytest.fixture` for `mock_driver` and `graber`:** These fixtures provide convenient access to the mocked objects, making your tests more readable.

5. **Asynchronous Testing with `asyncio.run`:** The `asyncio.run` call is now correctly used to run the asynchronous functions.

6. **Comprehensive Example Tests:**  The example tests now cover the `grab_page` method and handle cases for `id_product`, `name`, `description_short`, and `local_saved_image`.

7. **Clear Assertions:** The tests now have clear assertions using `assert` statements to verify the expected results.

8. **Robust Exception Handling (Example):** Added a basic example of how to test exceptions. This would need to be adapted if there are other potential exceptions in the original code.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Install pytest:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **Replace Placeholder Comments:** In the actual test file, replace the `# ...` with test functions for methods like `self.id_manufacturer`, etc.  Follow the same pattern for handling valid input, invalid input, edge cases, and exceptions.

- **Adjust Mock Data:**  Adapt the mock data to fit the specific data requirements of the methods you are testing.

Now you have a much better foundation for testing the `Graber` class, covering valid input and also important methods. Remember to add tests for every method in the `Graber` class and any associated exception handling. Remember to adapt the `MockGraber` class to include all the functions you want to test, and add corresponding assertions.
