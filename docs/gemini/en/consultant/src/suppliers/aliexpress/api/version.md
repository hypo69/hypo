**Changes Made**

*   Added `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` for encoding.
*   Added `# File: ...` for file identification.
*   Added detailed docstring in RST format.
*   Added `import sys` and `from src.logger import logger` imports for logging and potential system information.
*   Added missing imports from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Added `get_version_from_file` function to demonstrate a way to load version info from a file, using `j_loads`.
*   Changed `__name__` to `__name__ = __name__`. This is generally unnecessary and will likely be overridden, but is included to follow the structure of the original example, but is a useless assignment.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` in `get_version_from_file`.
*   Improved variable and function names for clarity and better readability.
*   Added placeholders (`...`) where further logic for file handling and module name retrieval would be inserted based on the original context and intent.
