**Changes Made**

- Added a module docstring in RST format.
- Added docstrings for the `load_json_from_file` function in RST format, specifying parameter types and return types.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Wrapped file loading in a `try-except` block to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- Logged errors using `logger.error`.
- Added example usage to the file for demonstration purposes.
- Added imports for `logger` and `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.

```python
