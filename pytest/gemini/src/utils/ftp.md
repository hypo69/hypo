**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `monkeypatch` from `pytest` to mock the `ftplib.FTP` methods. This is crucial for unit testing these functions because they interact with external resources (FTP server). This way, you don't need an actual FTP server.
* **Error Handling:**  The tests cover cases where the connection fails, file transfer fails, and the file retrieval fails, testing the `try...except` blocks in the original code.
* **Edge Cases:** The tests attempt to cover some edge cases, including empty file names, empty destination directories, and invalid file paths.  **Crucially, there are now tests for failure cases** in each of the functions.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Function names are more descriptive, and comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.
* **Fixtures for Mocking:** `mock_ftp_session` fixture helps mock the FTP session for more controlled tests.  The `mock_file` fixture helps mock the file being transferred.
* **Removed Unnecessary Imports:** Unnecessary imports are removed, making the code more concise.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_ftp.py`).
2.  Make sure the `hypotez` package is in your Python path.
3.  Run pytest from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_ftp.py
    ```

This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the FTP functions, covering both success and failure scenarios. Remember to adapt the test file paths to your specific setup. Also, replace placeholder error messages with meaningful ones.
