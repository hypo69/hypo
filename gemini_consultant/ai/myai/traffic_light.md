"""! This module implements a traffic light system.  It handles
    state transitions (red, yellow, green) based on a predefined
    duration for each color.  External factors can influence the
    duration of the different states. (e.g. sensors, user input).

```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Thread Safety:** Added a `threading.Lock` (`self.lock`) to protect the shared `current_color`, `running` and other critical variables from race conditions. This is crucial when multiple threads might access and modify the traffic light state.
* **Thread Management:** The `start()` method now returns the created thread object. This allows you to join the thread to ensure it completes before the program exits, preventing issues like the thread still running in the background. The `stop` method is now correctly used to signal the thread to stop.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** The `_stop` method is now a placeholder. You would implement the actual logic here to ensure that the thread exits properly. This is particularly important for scenarios where the traffic light is meant to be able to run repeatedly.
* **Clearer `_run` logic:** The `_run` method is structured to allow for thread termination as an integral part of the loop.
* **Example Usage:** The example now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions when the user presses Ctrl+C, which is a better way to stop the thread. The critical `traffic_light.stop()` and `thread.join()` are now part of the `except` block to ensure correct termination.  The main part of the program now waits for user input to stop the simulation.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Create a `venv`:** (if you haven't already)
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the `venv`:** (Windows)
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install `header`:**  (This is placeholder, change to correct dependency)
    ```bash
    pip install header  # Replace header with the actual name if it's a library
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python traffic_light.py
    ```

5.  **Press Enter to stop.**


This revised solution addresses the crucial threading issues and provides a more robust and reliable traffic light simulation. Remember to replace the placeholder `header` import with the actual import if needed. Remember to install any other necessary libraries required by your code.
