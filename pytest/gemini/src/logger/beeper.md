**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:**  Crucially, I've added the necessary `from ... import ...` lines to import the required classes and functions from `hypotez.src.logger.beeper` for the tests to work.  You might need to adjust the import paths if your project structure is different.


2. **Fixtures:**  Created fixtures `beeper_instance`, `beep_level_success`, `beep_level_error`, and `invalid_beep_level` to encapsulate the setup for the tests. This promotes better organization and reduces redundancy.


3. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The `test_beep_invalid_frequency` tests are now using `pytest.raises` to test the expected exception message when an invalid frequency is passed.


4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various levels and the string version to thoroughly test different use cases of the `beep` method.


5. **Silent Mode Tests:** Added `test_silent_mode_decorator` to check the functionality of the `silent_mode` decorator, covering both the silent and non-silent scenarios.


6. **Handling No Melody:** Added a `test_beep_no_melody` to check if `beep` appropriately handles a level that doesn't have an associated melody.  This is crucial to catch a potential edge case.


7. **asyncio:** The `asyncio.run(...)` calls are essential.  The `beep` method is asynchronous, and you must run it in an event loop for the tests to be accurate.


8. **Mocking `winsound` (Optional but Recommended):**  For more robust testing, especially if `winsound.Beep` has dependencies (like external libraries), consider using `pytest-mock` to mock the `winsound` module. This prevents the tests from relying on the actual beep sound generation (which can lead to flaky tests or issues in CI/CD environments).

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_beeper.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_beeper.py`.

This significantly improved test suite addresses the requirements, uses best practices, and is more likely to provide robust and reliable testing for the `beeper` module.  Remember to adapt the imports and paths if your project structure is different.  If you have more complex interactions (e.g., file handling), mocking would become even more important.


Remember to install `pytest-mock` if you want to mock the `winsound` module for more reliable testing: `pip install pytest-mock`
