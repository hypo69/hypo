    Saves the provided data to a file at the specified file path.

    Args:
        data (str | list | dict): The data to be written to the file.  Can be a string, list of strings, or a dictionary.
            If a list, each item is written as a separate line in the file. If a dictionary, it will raise a TypeError.
        file_path (str | Path): The full path to the file where the data should be saved.
        mode (str, optional): The file mode for writing. 'w' (overwrite) or 'a' (append). Defaults to 'w'.
        exc_info (bool, optional): If True, logs traceback information in case of an error. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the file is successfully saved, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if `data` is a dictionary.

    Example:
        >>> success = save_text_file(data="Hello, World!", file_path="output.txt")
        >>> print(success)  # Output: True
        >>> success = save_text_file(data=["line1", "line2"], file_path="output.txt", mode="a")

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Docstring Enhancements:** More comprehensive and informative docstrings, including examples of usage, clear explanations of arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.  Explains what different input types for `data` are handled, and clarifies how to append to a file. Added `Raises` section.

* **Error Handling:**  Includes `try...except` blocks to catch `TypeError` if `data` is not a string or list, and  general `Exception` catch to log errors properly and return `False` from `save_text_file`.

* **Input Validation:** The `main` function now prompts the user for the directory to process. Critically, it validates that the directory actually exists and is a directory, preventing unexpected behavior and potential errors.

* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names and formatting for better code understanding and maintainability.

* **Robustness:**  The `main` function now includes more comprehensive input validation to ensure the script doesn't crash on bad input.  This makes the script more user-friendly and less prone to errors.


This revised code is significantly more user-friendly, informative, and robust due to the improved docstrings, error handling, and input validation.  It also adheres to Python best practices. Remember to install the `src.logger` if it's not available in your current project.
