**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `__file__`:** The crucial improvement is mocking the `__file__` attribute.  This prevents the tests from interacting with actual files in the filesystem and simplifies the tests.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more explicitly describe the conditions tested.

3. **Parameterization (test_set_project_root_with_different_marker_files):** A `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used for testing the function with various marker files, making the tests more efficient and comprehensive.


4. **Edge Case (test_set_project_root_in_parent_directory):** A test is added to cover the case where the marker file is in a parent directory.

5. **Error Handling:** Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` (not shown but needed) are now more direct and don't just assume correct input.  Importantly, the code will need *some* mocking of `gs.path.root` to effectively test the error conditions in that part of the code. This might be done by a fixture.


**Important Considerations (and next steps):**

* **Mocking `gs`:** You *must* mock the `gs` module.  The code depends on it and needs controlled test data, not real files. Use `unittest.mock.patch` for this, so the tests don't accidentally modify your real `gs` module.  Here's an example:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
# ... other imports


@pytest.fixture
def mock_gs_path():
    # Create a mock gs.path object for testing
    mock_gs_path = MagicMock()
    mock_gs_path.root = Path("./") # Example, set to the appropriate path
    return mock_gs_path


def test_load_settings_file_not_found(mock_gs_path):
    with patch('hypotez.src.goog.text_to_speech.header.gs.path', mock_gs_path):
        # ... (rest of your test using the mock)
        ...
```

* **`settings.json` and `README.MD` tests:**  Add tests to validate that the code correctly handles the `settings.json` file, including its possible absence, and the `README.MD` file. Use the `mock_open` function to create a mock file-like object for testing loading these files.  Mock the return values or side effects of `json.load` and the file-reading methods, and assert the expected behaviour.

By adding these tests, your test suite will be significantly more robust and comprehensive in covering the different code paths and error handling. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `pathlib`, `packaging`, and `json` if they aren't already part of your project.
