**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Uses `pytest.fixture` `mock_files` to create a temporary directory with mock files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `settings.json`, `README.MD`) for testing. This isolates the test from the actual file system and avoids side effects.
2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).
3. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where no marker files are found, no marker files are given as input.
4. **Exception Handling (Partial):**  The original code had `try...except` blocks but didn't handle the exceptions effectively. This is still relevant but would need more comprehensive exception tests in a real-world scenario.
5. **Fixture for No Files:**  Added `mock_no_files` to test the scenario where no marker files are present, crucial for robustness.
6. **Correct Path Resolution:**  Crucially, the `tmp_path` in the fixtures now provides the appropriate base path for constructing files.
7. **Import sys:** The original code was missing the import statement for sys, which is required to add the root directory to sys.path. This has been included in the fix.
8. **Comprehensive tests:** Ensures correct behavior for the most common cases (marker file in correct spot, not in spot, more than one, no files passed as input).

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_header.py
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks in the original code need more extensive testing for specific error conditions (e.g., `json.JSONDecodeError` if `settings.json` has invalid JSON).
- **`sys.path`:** Be mindful of the impact of modifying `sys.path` within a test function; tests should be independent.   The test now ensures the path is in `sys.path`.

This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of test cases for the `set_project_root` function, covering various scenarios including edge cases and error handling. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual expected behavior of the function and the specific errors it might raise.
