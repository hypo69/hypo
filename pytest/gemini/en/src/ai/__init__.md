# Important: Replace the placeholder comments and the placeholder model instantiation

# Example of error handling testing using pytest.raises for OpenAI
# Add similar test cases for other methods and scenarios in your actual code.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Replacement:** The code now includes placeholder comments (`# Replace with ...`)  where you should insert the actual prompt, expected response, and initialization logic for your `GoogleGenerativeAI` and `OpenAIModel` classes.  This is **absolutely critical**.  Without the actual class implementation, these tests won't run as intended.

2. **Specific Error Handling:** The `test_google_generate_text_empty_prompt` and `test_openai_complete_text_empty_prompt` tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for the `ValueError` exception you want to raise for empty prompts.  This is better than just a generic `assert` that the result is not None.  It ensures your exception-handling logic is functioning correctly.

3. **Edge Case Testing:** Added `test_google_generate_text_long_prompt` to test the behavior with a long prompt.  This is a vital edge case.


4. **Initialization Tests:** Added `test_google_ai_initialization` and `test_openai_ai_initialization` to check for correct instantiation.  These are crucial for verifying if the classes are set up correctly.


**Before Running:**

- **Replace Placeholders:**  Put your actual classes and methods in the example code.  Fill in the `prompt`, expected responses, and any initialization that your models require.
- **Import Necessary Modules:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries imported in your `test_ai.py` file, including `pytest`.

**How to Run:**

Save this code as `test_ai.py` in the same directory as your `__init__.py` file. Then, run:

```bash
pytest test_ai.py
```

This updated solution provides a significantly more robust and accurate testing framework for your AI classes. Remember that a comprehensive test suite requires tests for various possible inputs, error conditions, and edge cases, and this framework is a starting point for you to expand upon based on your specific requirements. Remember to handle actual API responses, which can include error codes from the external API.  Add more tests tailored to your methods and the expected API behavior.
