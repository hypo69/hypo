```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `browser.scripting`:** The original code relies on the `browser.scripting` module, which is not part of the standard Python library.  This is crucial for testing because it simulates an external dependency. The `MockBrowserScripting` class acts as a stub. In a real project, you would use a more sophisticated mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`.

2. **Fixtures:**  The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create `tab_data` and the `mock_browser_scripting` object. This isolates the tests and ensures data setup is handled appropriately.  This is vital for testing external dependencies.

3. **Asynchronous Tests:** The original code was synchronous, which wasn't correct.  The provided example was modified to be asynchronous.  This is done by using `async def` and `await`.  `pytest` can handle async tests properly.

4. **Exception Handling:** The `test_execute_script_invalid_file` and `test_execute_script_no_tab_id` now use `pytest.raises` to assert that the function correctly raises exceptions in those specific cases.  This is a crucial aspect of robust testing. The added error handling and type checking will catch unexpected behavior.

5. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, allowing for easier understanding of the test's purpose.

6. **Valid Input Test:** An additional `test_execute_script_valid_input` is included. This confirms the success path with expected input.

7. **Missing `tab.id` Edge Case (Critical):** The `test_execute_script_no_tab_id` test case added is crucial.  The original code would likely throw a `TypeError` if the `tab.id` was missing.  Correct testing needs to account for this.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_background.py`).
2.  Run the tests from your terminal using pytest:
   ```bash
   pytest test_background.py
   ```

**Crucial Considerations (if you're working on a real project):**

- **Actual Mocking:** The `MockBrowserScripting` class is a placeholder. For a real-world project, you'd use a mocking library (such as `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to create more comprehensive mocks of the `browser.scripting` module.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that `pytest` and any necessary mocking libraries are installed.
- **Asynchronous Code:**  If the actual `browser.scripting.executeScript` is asynchronous (as is likely), the tests must use `async` functions and `await`.
- **Error Handling:**  Always thoroughly check for possible exceptions that could be raised by `browser.scripting.executeScript`.  Your mock should properly emulate these behaviors for comprehensive testing.


This significantly improved version addresses the issues of the original response and provides a much more robust and practical testing approach. Remember to adapt the mocking based on the specific structure and interactions of the real `browser.scripting` module.
