```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  The code now uses `@pytest.fixture` for `setup` and `focus_group_world`. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding state contamination between them. The `focus_group_world` fixture populates the world with the necessary agents (Lisa, Marcos, Oscar) to match the original tests.  Importantly, I've added an assertion to ensure the world isn't empty, as testing on an empty world would have caused errors.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_story_start_valid`, `test_story_start_invalid_requirements`).

* **Exception Handling:** Tests now include `pytest.raises` for checking exception handling in the case of invalid inputs (e.g., missing requirements).  This is a significant improvement in test coverage.

* **Empty World Handling:** Tests now include scenarios for empty worlds, ensuring robustness against unexpected situations.

* **Mock Data:** The code no longer relies on external functions (`create_lisa_the_data_scientist`, etc.) to populate the world. This is crucial because external calls are often unreliable and difficult to test and may not accurately match your intended test environment.

* **Realistic Simulation:** The `world.run(2)` call is kept to simulate the execution context required by the code, but it's critical to understand that this is a *simplification* of a real simulation step.  Replace this placeholder with actual simulation logic if needed.

* **Import `testing_utils`:** The code now properly imports the `testing_utils` module (assuming it exists) and uses `proposition_holds` from it.

* **Corrected Example Data**: The example data is correctly populated to represent the example agents needed in the original function.

This improved solution provides a more comprehensive and robust set of test cases. Remember to adapt the `testing_utils` module and simulation logic (the `world.run(2)` part) to match your actual implementation. Remember to replace the placeholder simulation logic with your real world interaction logic if it's more complex.
