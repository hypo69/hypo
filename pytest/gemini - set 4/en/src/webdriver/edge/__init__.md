#Important note! Tests for initialization MUST use a fixture to avoid issues with the driver object not being defined. 

#Important note about edge cases!
#Add tests for cases where the webdriver dependencies (geckodriver, chromedriver) are missing from the system.
# This kind of error will only be detected during test execution.

#Important Considerations for a real test suite:
# - Add imports for any necessary external libraries.
# - Include tests for any other methods in the Edge class.
# -  Handle potential exceptions raised by the Edge class methods in a robust way.
# -  Use proper fixtures for setting up and tearing down the Edge driver, particularly when dealing with setup and teardown. Use `pytest.mark.usefixtures` where appropriate.




```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the scenario (e.g., `test_edge_init_invalid_options`).

2. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test exceptions for invalid input cases (`test_edge_init_invalid_options`, `test_edge_init_non_dict_options`).

3. **Fixture for Options:** `example_edge_options` fixture provides sample data for the `Edge` constructor, allowing for more controlled and reusable test scenarios.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for valid and invalid option formats, including an empty dictionary for edge case.

5. **Placeholder for Driver Start Test:**  `test_edge_start_driver` provides a structure for testing driver initialization.  Crucially, it's a placeholder; you **must** adapt it to the actual `start_driver()` method's behavior (e.g., returning a driver object or raising an exception under certain conditions).

6. **Important Considerations:** The comments highlight the need for more context-specific tests (like driver start failures due to missing dependencies), as well as proper setup and teardown for testing and using `pytest.mark.usefixtures`.

7. **Missing Dependencies Check:** Included a placeholder for checking if the necessary libraries are correctly installed (important edge case testing). This test is a placeholder, but it illuStartes the kind of testing needed for a production-quality suite.

**How to Run:**

To run these tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_edge.py`) and run it from your terminal:

```bash
pytest test_edge.py
```

**Important:**

- Replace the placeholder comments (`#If the function actually starts the driver...`) with the actual checks for the function's return values.
- Adapt the tests to handle potential exceptions that `Edge` may raise during initialization or operations.


This improved solution provides a more robust and complete set of test cases for the `Edge` class, including edge cases and exception handling, which is crucial for reliable code. Remember to replace the placeholder assertions in `test_edge_start_driver()` with the actual validation of the driver object or exceptions as appropriate. Add more tests for specific edge cases based on the functionality of the `Edge` class.
