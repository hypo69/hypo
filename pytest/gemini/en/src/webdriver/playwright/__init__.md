#Tests for the Playwrid class (if there are methods). Add tests specific to the class's methods below.

#
#@pytest.fixture
#def playwrid_instance_fixture():

#def test_playwrid_method_with_valid_input(playwrid_instance_fixture):

#def test_playwrid_method_with_invalid_input():
#    """Checks the behavior of a Playwrid method with invalid input."""
#    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
#        Playwrid().some_method("invalid")  # Replace with the method call and invalid input

#        assert True  #Import was successful
#    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
#        pytest.fail(f"Error importing Playwrid: {e}")

#These tests are placeholders.
#Important: Replace the comments with specific test cases based on the actual functionality of your `Playwrid` class.
# If the Playwrid class has methods, add tests to cover each method thoroughly with valid, invalid, and edge cases.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_playwrid_initialization`).

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  The example now includes a test using `pytest.raises` to check for a `ValueError`.  This is crucial for robust exception handling.

3. **Comprehensive Testing (Placeholder):**  The provided tests are placeholders.  You *must* replace the example comments with actual tests for the methods and attributes present in your `Playwrid` class, including valid input, invalid input, and edge cases.

4. **Fixture (Example):**  An example of a fixture (`playwrid_instance_fixture`) is provided, but remember to use it if appropriate.

5. **Import Error Test (Example):** An example is provided on how to test for import errors, but this might not be necessary for every situation.

6. **MODE Test (Example):** A test is included to check the correct definition of `MODE`

**How to use it:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Go through each placeholder comment in the test code and write actual test cases based on the functionality of the `Playwrid` class.  This is the most crucial part.

2. **Add input and expected output:** For each test, specify the expected input and the expected output or behavior.

3. **Run the tests:**  Save the code, and run `pytest` in your terminal.  This will execute the test functions and report the results.

4. **Address failing tests:**  If any tests fail, carefully examine the output and the expected vs. actual results to understand why. Correct the `Playwrid` code or the tests as needed.

By filling in the example placeholders with specific tests for the methods and attributes within your Playwrid class, you will have a much more comprehensive test suite. Remember to consider different input types, edge cases, and potential exceptions. Remember to replace `Playwrid().some_method()` with the appropriate method call.
