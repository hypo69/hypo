**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover a wider range of scenarios, including valid and invalid URLs, mixed lists, empty lists, and empty strings.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names clearly indicate the input and expected outcome.
* **Explicit Assertions:** Uses `assert actual_id == expected_id` for better error messages.
* **`pytest.raises` not needed:**  The original code did not raise exceptions for invalid input, so `pytest.raises` is not necessary in these tests.  The function correctly returns `None` for empty lists or strings with no IDs, which is tested.
* **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** Tests are included for various edge cases, like lists with mixed data types, a list where no IDs match, etc.
* **Docstrings:** Updated docstrings to reflect the test's purpose.
* **Robustness:** Handles mixed data (invalid URLs, `None` values) in the input lists gracefully.
* **Correctness:** Ensures the tests cover all the cases the original function should handle.

This revised test suite is more comprehensive and provides better test coverage for the `extract_prod_ids` function.  Remember to save the tests in a file named `test_extract_product_id.py` (or similar) in the same directory as the `extract_product_id.py` file.  Then run `pytest` from your terminal to execute the tests. Remember to adjust the path imports if needed.
