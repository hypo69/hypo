How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that locates the project root directory.  It then loads settings from a `settings.json` file and project documentation from a `README.MD` file, if they exist. Finally, it defines several variables representing project metadata (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a link for coffee support).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules: `sys`, `json`, `packaging.version`, and `pathlib`. It also imports the `gs` module (likely a custom module) and specifies the file encoding and interpreter for clarity.

2. It defines a constant `MODE` likely for development or production modes.

3. The `set_project_root` function is defined, taking a tuple of marker files as input. This function aims to find the project root directory by traversing up the directory tree from the current file's location.

4. The function iterates through parent directories until one containing any of the marker files (e.g., 'pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git') is found.

5. If a suitable root directory is found, the function adds it to the `sys.path` to enable importing modules from the project's source tree.

6. The function returns the found path to the root directory.

7. The `__root__` variable is assigned the result of calling `set_project_root()`, retrieving the project's root path.

8. The code attempts to open and load settings from a `settings.json` file located within the project root directory. If the file is not found or the JSON is malformed, it uses a `...`  (omitting the error handling block for brevity).

9.  The code attempts to read the project's documentation from a `README.MD` file. Similarly, if the file isn't found or is malformed, the `...` handles the situation.

10. The code defines several variables containing project metadata (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`) by fetching data from the loaded `settings.json` file. Defaults are set if the settings file or specific data are missing.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have a project structure like this:
    # myproject/
    #   pyproject.toml
    #   requirements.txt
    #   src/
    #       settings.json
    #       README.MD
    #       ... (other files) ...

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.gearbest.header import set_project_root

    project_root = set_project_root()

    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")  # Output project name from settings.json
    print(f"Version: {__version__}") # Output version from settings.json
    print(f"Documentation: {__doc__}") # Output documentation from README.MD
