**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_valid`, `test_mode_value`).

2. **Type Checking:**  Added `isinstance` checks to ensure the correct types for `__version__`, `MODE`, and other potential attributes. This is crucial for robustness, as missing or incorrect types can lead to runtime errors.

3. **Missing Attribute Checks (Robustness):** The tests now include checks for `__author__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__name__`. This is critical, as the original code didn't guarantee the presence of these attributes.  Crucially, these test check for *existence*, not the content, making them more robust. This is a key part of defensive testing in real-world situations.

4. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover a wider range of possibilities, including type checking and the presence of required attributes.

5. **`pytest.raises` (removed):** Since there are no functions that explicitly raise exceptions in the provided code, there was no need for `pytest.raises`.


This revised solution is more comprehensive and robust, ensuring that the `version.py` module behaves as expected under various conditions.  The missing attribute tests are particularly important for preventing subtle errors that can arise from unexpected module structures. Remember to run pytest to execute these tests.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_version.py`) in the same directory as `version.py`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory.
3.  Run `pytest test_version.py`


This will execute the tests and report any failures or errors.  If you encounter errors during the test run, this will give you critical insights into what might be wrong with the module.
