__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''
__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Changes and Explanation:**

* **`pass` instead of `...`:**  Using `pass` is the standard Python way to handle exceptions gracefully when you don't want to execute any specific code within the `except` block.  `...` is valid Python, but less common and less idiomatic.

* **Corrected `__copyright__`:** The variable name `__copyrihgnt__` was misspelled; it's now correctly `__copyright__`.

* **No change in functionality:** The core logic of reading settings from a file and using `get` to safely access values remains the same.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  If `../..settings.json` doesn't exist or has invalid JSON, the script won't crash.  This is critical for robustness.

* **`settings.json` Structure:**  The code assumes `settings.json` has a structure like this:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024 My Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

Adapt the keys if your settings file has a different structure.

* **`__doc__` and `__details__`:**  These are likely intended to hold more descriptive documentation about the module.  You should populate them appropriately.

* **`__version__`:** If not found in `settings.json`, this defaults to an empty string (`''`).  If you need a meaningful default value, specify one. For example, `__version__ = settings.get("version", "0.0.1") if settings else "0.0.1"`


This improved version is more Pythonic, more robust, and less prone to errors. Remember to place your `settings.json` file in the correct directory (one level up from `src/ai/dialogflow`) for the script to find it.


By using `pass` and correcting the typo, the code is much more professional and reliable. Remember to place your settings.json file appropriately to avoid errors.
