OpenAI Assistants API Quickstart
==============================

This quick-start template demonstrates using the OpenAI Assistants API with Next.js, featuring streaming, tool use (code interpreter and file search), and function calling.  The template showcases how to integrate various functionalities into a user-friendly chat interface.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Modules:**  The generated RST now uses placeholders (`# Replace with actual module name if applicable`) for the module names.  This is crucial because there's no Python code provided in the input.  If you provide Python files, these placeholders will be replaced with the actual module names.

2. **TOC Structure:** The `.. toctree::` directive is correctly structured to create a table of contents, linking to different sections of the documentation.


3. **Missing Functionality:** Since there's no Python code, the `automodule` directives don't link to anything.  You need to process the actual Python files to generate the documentation for the functions, classes, etc.

4. **Sections:** The documentation now includes sections for Setup, Deployment, Overview, Components, and Endpoints, as requested.  These were created using the level 1 (`=`), 2 (`-`), 3 (`~`), and 4 (`^`) headers.

5. **Missing context:**  The original description lacks specific Python files, so the RST is very generic.  Actual content won't be generated until Python code is provided.


**How to use with Python Code (Example):**

If you provide a Python file named `app/components/chat.py`,  the RST generation would look like this in the `quickstart_components.rst` file:

```rst
Main Components
---------------

.. automodule:: app.components.chat
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```

This example shows how to use `automodule` with a specific Python file. The `:members:`, `:undoc-members:`, and `:show-inheritance:` are essential for Sphinx to correctly document classes, functions, and their inheritance structure.  Ensure that `app.components.chat` is the correct module path corresponding to the Python file's location.


**Crucial Next Step:** You need to provide the Python code to generate the actual documentation.  These placeholders serve as a template for how the documentation will link to the Python code when it's available.
