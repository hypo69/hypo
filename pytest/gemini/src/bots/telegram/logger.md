**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`configure_logging` Tests:** Added tests to check both valid modes (`'dev'` and `'prod'`) and invalid mode.
2. **`log_message` Tests:**
   - The crucial addition of a `caplog` fixture and example usage.
   - Tests with different log levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`).  Crucially,  tests now use `caplog` to capture the logged messages, allowing reliable assertions in the `test_log_message_with_caplog` test.
3. **Example of `caplog` Fixture:** DemonStartes how to use `pytest.LogCaptureFixture` from pytest to properly capture logged output.  This is necessary to verify the log messages.
4. **Placeholder Assertions:** The commented-out assertions in `test_log_message_info` and `test_log_message_debug` were crucial placeholders.  You **must** include assertions to confirm the message was logged using the `caplog` fixture.

**To Run the Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Save the code:**  Create a file named `test_logger.py` (or similar) and place the provided code in it.

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_logger.py
   ```

**Important:**  The example `logger.py` code is minimal. Replace the placeholder `...` with your actual implementation of `logger.py` to get thorough and accurate tests.  The `caplog` fixture and assertion examples are absolutely critical for effective log testing.
