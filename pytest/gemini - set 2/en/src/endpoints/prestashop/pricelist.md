**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial improvement is mocking the `request` method.  This prevents your tests from actually making external API calls, which can be slow and unreliable.  The `unittest.mock.MagicMock` is used to create a mock object that acts like the actual `request` method but doesn't do anything except return a value or raise an exception (as shown in the test cases).

2. **Comprehensive Tests:** Includes tests for `__init__`, `request_prices` (with valid and empty input, and an `invalid_products` case), `update_source`, and `modify_product_price`.

3. **Edge Cases:** The `test_request_prices_empty_products` test handles the scenario where the `products` list is empty.

4. **Type Handling:** The `test_request_prices_invalid_products` test shows how to handle cases where the input is not of the expected type.

5. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are added to verify that the correct values are returned or exceptions are raised as expected.

6. **Fixture for `api_credentials`:** A fixture is created to provide the credentials to the `PriceListRequester` constructor, making the tests more organized and reusable.

7. **Fixture for `products`:** A fixture is added to hold the product list.

**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the above test code in a file (e.g., `test_pricelist.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_pricelist.py
    ```

This revised solution is much more robust and reliable because it avoids external calls, making the tests independent, fast, and reliable for testing different conditions. Remember to replace `"your_real_source"` with the actual source name. Also, `modify_product_price` needs to be implemented in the future.
