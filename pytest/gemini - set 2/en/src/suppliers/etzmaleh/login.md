**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `logger`:** The original code relied on the `logger` from `src.logger`.  This solution mocks `logger` so our tests don't interact with the actual logging system.  This is crucial for testing because external systems (like logging) can introduce flakiness or slow down tests.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_login_valid_input`).

3. **Thorough Input Handling:** Tests now handle `None` input (important edge case).

4. **Edge Cases:** The tests include `""` (empty string) and a very long string to test for potential issues with input length.

5. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:**  The `test_login_no_input` correctly tests if `login` raises the expected `TypeError`.

6. **Consistent Assertions:** Assertions are aligned to verify the return value is `True` in cases where the original code did not explicitly return `False` for any situation


**Crucial Considerations:**


* **`src.logger`:** Make sure the `src.logger` module is correctly imported and configured before running the tests.


* **Error Handling:** The original code doesn't handle any invalid inputs.  In a real scenario, you might want to raise exceptions or return specific error codes. The `test_login_no_input` case is now showing how to check if a `TypeError` is raised.


* **Robustness:** The tests cover more scenarios to ensure the function's behavior is correctly handled with various inputs.  The most significant improvements are in handling potentially invalid inputs (e.g., `None`).


By addressing these points, the tests provide better coverage and make sure the `login` function is behaving correctly in different situations. Remember to replace `"example_supplier"` with a more relevant test value for your scenario.  Without knowing the expected behavior with invalid inputs, this test suite is as comprehensive as it can be.
