**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Graber:**  The original tests lacked the import for the `Graber` class.  This is crucial, as you can't test a class that doesn't exist.

2. **Placeholder Tests for Graber:** The example test cases now correctly import `Graber`.  Crucially, they show how to test for error handling and expected function return values.


3. **Mock Data (Important):** Testing against a live API can be problematic, especially when testing code you don't control. In the example `test_graber_retrieves_data_successfully`, we use placeholder mock data for checking if the function returns a correct type. This isolates the tests and makes them repeatable without needing access to a real GearBest API.


4. **Exception Handling:** The `pytest.raises` context manager is effectively used to verify if `Graber` raises the correct exceptions (e.g., `ValueError` for invalid URLs, exceptions raised during API requests) for different error scenarios.


5. **Specific Error Messages:** Testing for specific error messages enhances the confidence in the error handling mechanism implemented in the `Graber` class.


**How to proceed with more tests:**

1. **Understand Graber:** Examine the `Graber` class's code to understand its methods, arguments, and possible error scenarios.
2. **Design Tests:** Create test functions for each method in `Graber`. Consider various inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases).
3. **Use Fixtures:** Define fixtures for creating test instances of `Graber`, providing test data, and setting up any necessary dependencies. 
4. **Mock Data (if needed):** Mock API calls or data fetching to avoid external dependencies when possible and to control test input. This allows for faster, more deterministic, and reliable tests.



Remember to replace the placeholder tests with specific tests based on the actual functionality of the `Graber` class. Also, make sure to install the `pytest` library if you don't have it already: `pip install pytest`
