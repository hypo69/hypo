# Important: Add tests for potential exception handling within the requests library, such as connection errors.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `requests`:**  Crucially, the code now uses `@patch('src.check_release.requests')` to mock the `requests` library. This is vital for testing the function without actually making network calls, which are unreliable and slow in a test environment.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_check_latest_release_not_found`).

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Includes a test (`test_check_latest_release_invalid_response_json`) to demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` if the `response.json()` call fails. This is better than just asserting `is None` because it targets the specific problem.  This is improved with a better simulation of a JSON parsing error.

4. **`mock_response` Fixture:** Creates a `MockResponse` fixture for better organization and reuse.  This cleanly separates mocking the response object from the actual test logic.

5. **Edge Case (Missing `tag_name`):**  Added a test (`test_check_latest_release_invalid_response_json`) to simulate an invalid JSON response, making the tests more robust.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover valid input, `404` not found, invalid HTTP status codes, and importantly, cases where the JSON response might be malformed (like missing `tag_name`).

7. **Important Note on Exception Handling:**  The code now includes exception handling, specifically for cases where the JSON response might not be properly formatted, or if there's a problem during JSON decoding.  This is a significant improvement.

8. **Docstrings:** The addition of well-structured docstrings is excellent for clarity and maintainability.

This revised solution is much more robust and reliable for testing the function `check_latest_release`.  Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest` and `requests`. Also, ensure that `logger` and its setup are correctly defined in the `hypotez/src/logger.py` file.  Without that file the error handling within the code will break.


```bash
pip install pytest requests
