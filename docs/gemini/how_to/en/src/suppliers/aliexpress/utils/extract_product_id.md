    Args:
        urls (str | list[str]): A URL, a list of URLs, or product IDs.  Input can be a single string or a list of strings.

    Returns:
        str | list[str] | None: A list of extracted item IDs, a single ID, or `None` if no valid ID is found.  Returns `None` if the input is invalid for any reason (not a string or list, or an empty list/string).  Returns an empty list if a list of URLs is passed but no valid IDs are found.

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `TypeError` handling to check if the input `urls` is a string or a list of strings.  Also added handling for empty lists and empty strings, returning `None` in these cases to avoid unexpected behavior. This makes the function more robust.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved docstrings with more comprehensive examples, including error cases (empty lists and non-string inputs) and a clear description of return values.  Also clarified what happens when input is a single string vs a list of strings (the single string case is handled gracefully).
* **Efficiency:**  The code remains efficient.  Using list comprehension is generally more concise and readable compared to a loop.


This revised solution is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices by handling various potential issues.  The docstrings now accurately reflect the function's behavior, making it easier for others (and yourself in the future) to use and maintain. This is crucial in a production environment.


**How to use:**

```python
from extract_product_id import extract_prod_ids

# Example usage (with error handling):
urls = ["https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123456.html", "7891011.html", "https://example.com/wrongurl"]
extracted_ids = extract_prod_ids(urls)
print(extracted_ids)  # Output: ['123456', '7891011']

urls = "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/987654.html"
extracted_id = extract_prod_ids(urls)
print(extracted_id)   # Output: '987654'

urls = [] # Empty list
extracted_id = extract_prod_ids(urls)
print(extracted_id) # Output: None

urls = 123  # Non-string input
try:
    extracted_id = extract_prod_ids(urls)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: Input must be a string or a list of strings.
