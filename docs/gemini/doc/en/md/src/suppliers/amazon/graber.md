# hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, a subclass of `Grbr`, for fetching product information from Amazon.  It handles asynchronous operations and data extraction using web scraping techniques.  It utilizes a `Context` object for managing global configurations, and it includes a `close_pop_up` decorator to potentially handle pop-up windows.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class extends the `Grbr` class to specifically handle data extraction from Amazon. It manages the initialization and data fetching processes for the amazon supplier.


**Methods**

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` instance, setting the `supplier_prefix` and initializing the `Context` object.

#### `grab_page`

**Description**: Asynchronously grabs the product fields from the Amazon website.


**Parameters**

- `driver (Driver)`: The webdriver instance to use for interacting with the website.


**Returns**

- `ProductFields`: A `ProductFields` object containing the extracted product data.  This might be a complex nested structure.


## Functions


### `close_pop_up`


**Description**: This function creates a decorator (`@close_pop_up`) to handle potentially closing pop-up windows before executing a target function. It's currently not used, although it's designed to be potentially called.


**Parameters**

- `value (Any, optional)`: Additional value passed to the decorator (currently unused).


**Returns**

- `Callable`: The decorator, which wraps the target function.

```
Note: The `close_pop_up` function and the `Context` class are currently commented out but are included in the documentation for completeness.
