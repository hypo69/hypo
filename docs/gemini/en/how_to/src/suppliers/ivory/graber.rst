How to use the `graber.py` code block
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a `Graber` class, inherited from a `Grbr` class, for extracting product data from the `ivory.co.il` website.  It handles various product fields and allows for customized data extraction through overridden methods.  The code uses asynchronous operations (`asyncio`) and a `Driver` object for interacting with a web browser.  It includes a `close_pop_up` decorator (though not currently used) for handling pop-up windows before proceeding with data extraction. The code also utilizes `pydantic` for data modeling and `jjson` for parsing JSON-like data.  Crucially, it centralizes data collection for multiple fields into a single method (`fetch_all_data`) which calls each individual field-extracting function. This enhances code organization and efficiency.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports various Python libraries such as `asyncio`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `functools`, `pydantic`, and others, which are used for different tasks, including asynchronous operations, file path handling, type hinting, and data validation.
2. **Define the `Graber` class:**  This class inherits from the `Grbr` class (likely containing base functionalities for data extraction). The `Graber` class initializes with a `supplier_prefix` and a `Driver` object. It also initializes a global `Context.locator_for_decorator` variable which is designed for use in a decorator if needed.
3. **Implement the `grab_page` method:** This method is the primary asynchronous function for extracting product data.
4. **Define asynchronous functions for each product field:**  The code contains a large number of asynchronous functions (`id_product`, `description_short`, `name`, etc.) responsible for retrieving the value for each product attribute.
5. **Aggregate data in `fetch_all_data`:** This central function calls each individual product field extraction function, allowing all the data to be collected in a single call, thereby improving organization and efficiency.
6. **Return the `ProductFields` object:** The `grab_page` method returns a `ProductFields` object, containing the extracted product data.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from src.suppliers.ivory.graber import Graber
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from src import gs # Assume this module exists

    async def main():
        # Initialize the WebDriver
        driver = await Driver.get_driver()
        # Initialize the Graber class.  You would likely need to pass
        # in details on where to find the product
        graber = Graber(driver)

        # Example usage to get product details
        product_fields = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product="12345", additional_shipping_cost="6789")

        print(product_fields)  # Print the extracted fields
        await driver.close_driver() # Close the WebDriver when finished

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

```

**Important Notes:**

* This code heavily relies on other modules (`gs`, `Grbr`, `Context`, `ProductFields`, `Driver`, `j_loads_ns`, `logger`) that are not defined within the provided snippet.  To use this `Graber` class, you will need these supporting modules.
* The placeholder comments within the `grab_page` method (and other places) indicate that specific data fetching functions are present, but their implementation is missing within this code snippet. These functions must be defined elsewhere.
* The `global d` assignment is generally undesirable and a strong sign of potential bugs.  The `d` variable should be handled appropriately within the scope of the `Graber` class, for instance, by making it an instance variable.


This improved response provides a more comprehensive and understandable explanation for using the provided code. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual implementation details. Remember to install the required libraries (`pydantic`, `jjson` etc.).
