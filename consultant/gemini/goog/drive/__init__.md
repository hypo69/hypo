""" module: consultant.gemini.goog.drive """
MODE = 'debug'
```python
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""" module: src.goog.drive """
""" Google API """



from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__ 

from .drive import GoogleDrive
```

**Explanation and Improvements (if any):**

The provided code is already quite good.  It's a standard Python module initialization file.  The only potential improvement is to document what `GoogleDrive` actually *is*.  Currently, only that it's a class/object from a submodule named `drive` is known.


**Example of improved documentation (within the file):**

```python
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""" module: src.goog.drive """
""" Google API """



from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__ 

from .drive import GoogleDrive


# Add some docstring for clarity.  (Important for others using this module)
"""
GoogleDrive:
A class for interacting with the Google Drive API.  

This module provides a client for the Google Drive API, allowing access to files, folders, and other resources.  Methods should be implemented within `goog/drive/drive.py`.
"""

```

**Further Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code, as written, assumes that `GoogleDrive` exists and that the required functions are available.  Add `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during import, especially in a production setting.
* **Dependencies:** If `GoogleDrive` depends on specific packages, list them in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility and installation by others.
* **Testing:** Unit tests are crucial to ensure the correctness and reliability of `GoogleDrive` and its associated functions.  Writing tests for `GoogleDrive` would greatly improve the quality of the module.
* **Code Style:**  While the code is functional, consider using a consistent code style guide (e.g., PEP 8) for better readability and maintainability.  Linters like `flake8` can help with this.


By addressing these points, you can make your module more robust, maintainable, and easily usable by others. Remember to place the documentation (docstrings) clearly within the code itself for future users.  It's crucial to document how to use `GoogleDrive`.
