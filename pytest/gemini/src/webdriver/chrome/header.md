```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Introduced `test_dir`, `settings_json`, and `readme_file` fixtures to create the necessary temporary directory and files for testing `set_project_root` without affecting the original project structure. This is crucial for isolating tests.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, reflecting the specific input and expected outcome.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** Added tests for cases where marker files are not found, located in higher directories, or not the expected file types to validate the robustness of the function.

4. **Error Handling:**  The original code had empty `...` sections for exception handling. This solution includes handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid input, files in different locations, and cases where marker files might not exist.

6. **Pathlib:** Uses `pathlib` for path manipulation, which is more robust and Pythonic.

7. **`pytest.raises`:**  No `pytest.raises` is needed for exception handling in this case, as the code is correctly handling exceptions by returning the current directory.

8. **Mocking or Stubbing (if needed):** For complex scenarios or interactions with external dependencies (e.g., `gs.path`), consider using mocking libraries like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to isolate the tests. If `gs` is a library you need to use, a proper stub is needed to mock `gs.path.root`.

9. **Asserting sys.path:** Added assertion to check that `__root__` is added to `sys.path` if it's found.



This improved test suite provides much more comprehensive coverage and is significantly better for ensuring the correctness of `set_project_root` under various conditions. Remember to install the required libraries (e.g., `pytest`, `packaging`) if you haven't already.  Remember to adapt the fixtures to use your actual `gs` library if needed.  If you require more complex testing of the entire `header` file, additional test cases for `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc. will be necessary. Remember to replace `"./test_dir"` with a different temporary directory if needed.
