**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names now explicitly describe the scenario, making the purpose of each test more obvious.

2. **Isolated Tests:**  Each test now creates a temporary directory and file structure, ensuring tests don't interfere with each other or the file system of the main project.

3. **Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_file` case is added to check when no marker file is found, which is a relevant edge case. The `test_set_project_root_marker_file_in_parent`  case is also included to handle scenarios where the marker file is in a parent directory.

4. **Exception Handling (Improved):** The original code had no test for `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`. These are now covered with tests, in this case using pytest-style testing for exceptions.

5. **Data Creation and Cleanup:** The code now creates temporary directories and files for each test to ensure that the test environment is clean and isolated.  It also cleans up those temporary directories and files after each test execution (using `tmp_dir.rmdir()`). This prevents file system clutter and ensures that the tests don't affect each other.

6. **Correct Assertions:** Assertions are used to verify that the root path is correctly identified in various scenarios.

7. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:** Fixtures are not needed for these tests, as the tests are self-contained and do not rely on external data sources.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_logger.py` in the same directory as your `header.py` file).
2.  Run the tests from your terminal using pytest:
    ```bash
    pytest test_logger.py
    ```


This revised solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive set of test cases for the `set_project_root` function, adhering to best practices for writing pytest tests. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Also, make sure that `hypotez/src` exists in the same directory as the `test_logger.py`.
