## Changes Made

- Added a module-level docstring in reStructuredText (RST) format, describing the module's purpose and functionality.
- Removed unnecessary shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`). These are typically handled by the environment and usually not needed in Python modules.
- Added a function `get_graber()` to encapsulate creation of the Graber object. This promotes better code organization and reusability.
- Added a docstring for the `get_graber()` function, following RST and Python docstring conventions.
- Replaced `MODE = 'dev'` with a comment, as this variable currently serves no purpose.
- Added placeholder `# ...` comments to illustrate usage. This is helpful for developers to understand how the module can be used.
- Removed imports of j_loads and j_loads_ns as they were not used. If needed, these must be imported from the correct file path (e.g., 'src.utils.jjson').
- Added a placeholder `# from __future__ import annotations` statement, which may be useful in some situations to suppress warnings.  However, it is commented out as it is not necessary in this specific example.
- Implemented a basic example usage within a conditional statement (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
- Improved variable and function naming consistency.
