# The user-provided code is missing, so no tests can be generated.
# To create tests, please provide the Python code to be tested.
# Example of how to structure tests once code is provided:


# Example fixture (replace with your actual fixture)
@pytest.fixture
def example_data():
    """Provides test data for the function."""
    return {"key1": "value1", "key2": 123}


# Example test functions (replace with tests for your code)
def test_function1_valid_input(example_data):
    """Checks correct behavior with valid input."""
    # Replace with your function call and assertions
    # Example:
    # result = function1(example_data['key1'])
    # assert result == expected_result
    pass

def test_function1_invalid_input():
    """Checks correct handling of invalid input."""
    # Replace with your function call and assertions for invalid input
    # Example:
    # with pytest.raises(TypeError):
    #     function1("invalid_input")
    pass


def test_function1_edge_case(example_data):
    """Checks behavior with edge cases."""
    # Replace with your function call and assertions for edge cases
    # Example:
    # result = function1(example_data['key2'])
    # assert result == expected_result_edge
    pass


# Add more test functions as needed to cover other functions, methods, and classes.
# Make sure the test function names clearly reflect the test's purpose.
