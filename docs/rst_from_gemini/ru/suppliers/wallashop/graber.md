**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Global Variable Management:** The `d` and `l` global variables are now initialized properly (and in a way that avoids multiple imports of the same class, which could create unexpected behavior).  This is crucial for avoiding potential errors caused by race conditions or incorrect initialization.
* **`__post_init__` Refinement:** The `__post_init__` method is now more direct in its assignment of `self.l`, which addresses a potential issue. Importantly, it correctly calls `super().__init__` to initialize the parent class.
* **`close_popup` decorator applied:**  The `@close_popup()` decorator is now correctly placed above the `grab_page` method, ensuring the popup-closing logic executes before the actual data fetching.
* **`_fetch_all_data` method:** Added an internal method to encapsulate the fetching of all the data. This is much cleaner and makes the logic inside `grab_page` easier to understand and maintain. It also allows for a single error handling block.
* **Error Handling:** The `grab_page` method now includes a `try...except` block to catch and log potential exceptions during the data fetching process. Returning `None` in the `except` block is a common way to signal an error to the caller.  It's crucial to handle possible issues and not to crash the entire process if something fails.
* **Parameter Handling:**  A dictionary (`**kwargs`) is now used to access optional data in `_fetch_all_data`. This makes the parameter handling much more robust. It also addresses the issue of using empty strings.


This revised code is significantly more robust, readable, and maintains a well-structured approach to asynchronous data fetching. It addresses most of the potential issues pointed out in the previous versions and provides a more comprehensive solution. Remember to adapt the `ProductFields` type to accurately reflect the data you're collecting. Remember to also replace the `...` parts with your actual data fetching logic.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Propagation:** Decide how you want to handle errors (logging, returning `None`, raising exceptions) and implement that consistently throughout the code.
* **`ProductFields`:**  Make sure the `ProductFields` class has the correct structure to accommodate the data you're extracting.
* **`fetch_specific_data`:**  If you have a function `fetch_specific_data`, use it within the `_fetch_all_data` method as needed.


By addressing these points, the code will be more reliable, maintainable, and easier to debug. Remember to adapt it to your specific data structures and requirements.
