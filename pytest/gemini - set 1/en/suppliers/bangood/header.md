**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` and `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the behavior of opening and reading files. This isolates the `get_project_root` function from the actual filesystem.  This is essential for writing reliable tests, especially those dealing with file I/O.  Without mocking, your tests would depend on the presence of real files, making them fragile.

* **`tmp_path` fixture:**  The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories and files for testing, ensuring clean test runs and avoiding conflicts between test cases.  The tests now create the necessary files (`pyproject.toml`, `settings.json`, `README.MD`) within the temporary directory.

* **Comprehensive test cases:** Added test cases covering different scenarios, including cases where the marker files are not present, or are in a nested folder, or in a parent folder.

* **Error Handling:**  The test now correctly handles the case where `settings.json` or `README.MD` file does not exist, ensuring your function's exception handling is working correctly.

* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are now more descriptive, making it easier to understand what the test is checking.

* **`sys.path` Patch:**  The `test_get_project_root_add_to_path` now correctly patches `sys.path` to an empty list. This is essential to avoid the problem of having leftover paths influencing the test results, a common issue in tests that modify `sys.path`.

* **Import statements:** Added the missing import statements for `json`.



This revised solution provides a much more robust and reliable set of tests.  It addresses the potential issues with real file paths and ensures that the tests are fully isolated from each other and the actual filesystem. Remember to install the `packaging` and `pytest` libraries if you haven't already.  (You probably have pytest already; if not, `pip install pytest`). This improved test suite is better equipped to catch potential errors in the original code. Remember to adapt the test cases based on the specific behavior and expected errors for the input code.
