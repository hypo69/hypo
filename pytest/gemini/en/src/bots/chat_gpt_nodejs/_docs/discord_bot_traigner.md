```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Dummy Functions:** The code now includes dummy functions (`train_model`, `test_model`, etc.) to represent the actual bot commands.  **Crucially, you must replace these with your actual bot's code.**  This example is simulating the functionality.
* **pytest Fixtures:** Fixtures `train_data` and `test_data` are added to provide test data for the functions.  This is better practice than hardcoding the data within the tests. `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary files for file-based tests, crucial for avoiding conflicts in tests.
* **Edge Cases and Error Handling:**  A `test_train_model_invalid_data` test is added to demonstrate how to test for invalid input.  I added a `pytest.raises` to illustrate checking for a TypeError if the function expects a specific type. Replace this with the appropriate exception your code actually raises.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive.
* **Modularity:** Tests are organized into functions for each command.
* **Focus on Functionality:** The tests now verify the *output* of the functions, checking for the expected strings in the responses.

**How to use this example with your code:**

1. **Replace Dummy Functions:** Substitute the dummy functions with your actual code for the bot's commands.  Pay careful attention to the input types and expected output formats.
2. **Add More Tests:**  Write more test functions for other commands and edge cases.
3. **Adjust Assertions:** Modify assertions in the test functions to match the expected behavior of your actual code.
4. **Run Tests:** Run the tests with `pytest`.


**Example of how to run tests:**

```bash
pytest test_discord_bot.py  # Replace test_discord_bot.py with your test file name
```

Remember to install the `pytest` library:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
