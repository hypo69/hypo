```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  It catches potential `FileNotFoundError` if `settings.json` is missing and `json.JSONDecodeError` if the JSON file has invalid format.  A `print` statement now informs the user of the error, which is good practice. This prevents the script from crashing. The default values for the variables will be used.
* **Typo Correction:** The typo in `__copyright__` ("copyrihgnt") has been fixed to `"copyright"`.  This is a common source of errors.
* **Explicit type annotations:** Type hints are preserved but made more specific to indicate that the variables contain strings.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is well-formatted, and variable names are consistent with Python conventions.
* **Best Practice:** The `if settings` checks are essential to prevent errors if `settings` is `None`.
* **Docstrings:** Although this file is likely not meant for external use, maintaining good documentation practices is important. The docstring now accurately reflects the purpose of the file.

**How to use this file:**

This file (`version.py`) now sets variables like `__version__`, `__author__`, etc. to be used by other modules that need this information.  Other parts of your project can import this file and access these variables.  For example:

```python
import goog.version

print(goog.version.__version__)
```

**Crucially:** This file assumes a `settings.json` file exists in the directory one level above the current script's location. If `settings.json` doesn't exist, the default values will be used as mentioned earlier.  Make sure that file is structured correctly with the key/value pairs needed for your project (e.g. 'version' for the version number, 'project_name' for project name, etc.).


```json
# settings.json example
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2023, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://anotherlink.com"
}
```


This revised solution is more robust, readable, and follows better Python programming practices. Remember to create the `settings.json` file in the correct location. Remember to replace the placeholder values in `settings.json` with your actual data. Remember to replace the placeholder links in the `__cofee__` variable.
