```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.webdriver.crawlee_python import CrawleePython

# Tests for the CrawleePython class (assuming it exists and has methods)
# Since the provided code only defines MODE, we'll create dummy tests.

# This assumes a CrawleePython class with a __init__ and maybe some methods.
# Replace with the actual method signatures from CrawleePython


def test_crawlee_python_init_valid_mode():
    """Checks the CrawleePython class initialization with a valid mode."""
    # Create an instance of CrawleePython, passing the mode.
    # Replace with your specific mode value if different.
    crawlee = CrawleePython(mode="dev")
    assert crawlee.mode == "dev"


def test_crawlee_python_init_invalid_mode():
    """Tests CrawleePython initialization with an invalid/unexpected mode."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:  # Use pytest.raises for exception
        crawlee = CrawleePython(mode="unknown")
    # Check that the exception message is as expected.
    assert "Invalid mode" in str(excinfo.value)

#Example test for a method (replace with actual method names)
#def test_crawlee_python_method_valid_input():
#    """Tests a specific method with valid input."""
#    crawlee = CrawleePython(mode="dev")
#    # Replace with the actual method call and expected output.
#    result = crawlee.my_method("valid_input")
#    assert result == "Expected output"

#Example test for a method with an edge case
#def test_crawlee_python_method_edge_case():
#    """Tests a specific method with an edge case input."""
#    crawlee = CrawleePython(mode="dev")
#    # Replace with the actual method call and expected output for the edge case.
#    result = crawlee.my_method("edge_input")
#    assert result == "Expected output for edge case"


# Example of a fixture (replace with actual fixture if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def some_fixture_data():
#     """Provides fixture data."""
#     return {"data": "some_value"}


# IMPORTANT:  If there are any other functions or classes in the file (other than CrawleePython),
# you need to add tests for them, modifying the above examples according to their structure.
# Note that these example tests are placeholders.  Replace them with tests
# reflecting the actual methods and classes defined in the `CrawleePython` file.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose and input type.

2. **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` if `CrawleePython` has specific exception handling for invalid modes.  Crucially, it checks the *content* of the exception message.

3. **Dummy Tests:** The example tests now correctly demonstrate how to write tests for a class.  Importantly, they account for the fact that the provided Python code only defined a variable `MODE`, and not a class.  You need to adapt these example tests to the actual methods and classes in your `CrawleePython` file.


4. **Structure:** The structure follows the example provided.  It shows how to create test functions, which are essential for writing isolated, independent tests.

5. **Fixture Example:** I've included a placeholder example for a fixture. You'd only need a fixture if your tests need to share or reuse some setup data.  In the example, the fixture would provide `some_fixture_data` to multiple tests.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Modify the example tests, particularly `test_crawlee_python_init_valid_mode`, `test_crawlee_python_init_invalid_mode`, `test_crawlee_python_method_valid_input`, and `test_crawlee_python_method_edge_case`,  with tests based on the actual methods and expected behaviors of the `CrawleePython` class from your `crawlee_python.py` file.
2. **Run Tests:** Execute the test file using `pytest`.  This will run all the tests and report the results.


**Crucial Next Step:**  You must provide the actual contents of the `hypotez/src/webdriver/crawlee_python/__init__.py` file (the Python code for the `CrawleePython` class) for more specific and correct tests. These tests are tailored to reflect the methods and functionality in your code.
