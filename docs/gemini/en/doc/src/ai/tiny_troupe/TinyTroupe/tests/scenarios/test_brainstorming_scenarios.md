# test_brainstorming_scenarios.py

## Overview

This file contains unit tests for brainstorming scenarios within the TinyTroupe framework.  It utilizes a simulated focus group environment to test the ability of agents to extract and summarize brainstorming results.

## Functions

### `test_brainstorming_scenario`

**Description**: This function simulates a brainstorming session within a focus group environment and tests the agent's ability to extract and summarize the generated ideas.

**Parameters**:

- `setup`:  (Placeholder) A setup fixture, likely providing the necessary environment for the test.
- `focus_group_world`: (TinyWorld): The simulated focus group environment.


**Returns**:

-  None

**Raises**:

- `AssertionError`: Raised if the extracted results do not match the expected output criteria, as evaluated by the assertion `proposition_holds()`.


**Detailed Explanation**:

The function first broadcasts a prompt to the focus group world to initiate the brainstorming session. It then runs the simulation for a specified duration.  It retrieves a specific agent ("Lisa") and prompts it to summarize the ideas generated. The function then utilizes `ResultsExtractor` to extract and process the results from the agent's response. The extracted results are printed, and an assertion verifies that the results contain a summary of the brainstorming ideas, including benefits and drawbacks for each idea.  Crucially, the assertion mechanism relies on `proposition_holds` to evaluate whether the summary conforms to expected criteria, indicating the outcome's alignment with the desired brainstorming structure and content. The `proposition_holds` function's implementation is critical but not visible here.


## Modules Imported

This file imports various modules crucial for its functionality:


- `pytest`: For running the tests.
- `logging`: For handling logging messages.
- `sys`: For modifying the Python path.
- `tinytroupe`: The core module providing classes and functions for the agent-based simulation.
- `tinytroupe.agent`: Contains the `TinyPerson` class representing the agents.
- `tinytroupe.environment`: Contains classes for simulating the environment, like `TinyWorld` and `TinySocialNetwork`.
- `tinytroupe.factory`: Contains factory methods for creating agents.
- `tinytroupe.extraction`: For extracting and processing the brainstorming results.
- `tinytroupe.examples`: Contains example agent creation functions (Lisa, Oscar, Marcos).
- `tinytroupe.control`: Contains functions for controlling the simulation (like `Simulation`).
- `testing_utils`: Likely contains custom utilities for testing (e.g., `proposition_holds`).
