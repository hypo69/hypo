## How to use the `products.py` module

This module provides functions for parsing product data, specifically for AliExpress API interactions.  It's designed to handle a list of product data, modifying it and returning a new list.


### `parse_product(product)`

This function takes a single product object (`product`) as input and modifies it in-place.  Crucially, it assumes the `product` object has a `product_small_image_urls` attribute, which is a string containing multiple image URLs, and it extracts those URLs.

**Example:**

```python
# Assuming you have a product object with the necessary attribute
# (e.g., from a library like `requests` or a database query)
import example_product_data  # Replace with your actual data import
sample_product = example_product_data.get_product()
print(f"Original product: {sample_product.product_small_image_urls}")

from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.helpers import products
parsed_product = products.parse_product(sample_product)
print(f"Parsed product: {parsed_product.product_small_image_urls}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Input Validation:** The code doesn't include any checks to ensure the `product` object exists or has the expected attributes.  You should add robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.  For example, check if the attribute exists before attempting to access it:
    ```python
    def parse_product(product):
        if hasattr(product, 'product_small_image_urls'):
            product.product_small_image_urls = product.product_small_image_urls.string
        return product
    ```
*   **Data Structure:** The code expects `product_small_image_urls` to be a string containing a list of image URLs. Ensure your data format is compatible with the `string` operation.  Consider using a more structured approach, like a list of URLs, to avoid potential errors and make the code more maintainable.


### `parse_products(products)`

This function takes a list of product objects (`products`) and returns a new list containing the parsed products.  It iterates through the input list and applies the `parse_product` function to each item.

**Example:**

```python
import example_product_data  # Replace with your actual data import
sample_products = example_product_data.get_products()
print(f"Original products: {sample_products}")

from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.helpers import products
parsed_products = products.parse_products(sample_products)
print(f"Parsed products: {parsed_products}")
```

**Important considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:**  Just like `parse_product`, add error handling within the loop to gracefully handle cases where a product object might be missing the necessary attribute or have an invalid format.
*   **Immutability:** The `parse_products` function creates a new list of parsed products.  This is generally a good practice for maintaining data integrity.


**Further Improvements:**

*   **Type Hinting:** Add type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   **Explicit error handling:** Raise exceptions or log informative messages when invalid data is encountered.
*   **Documentation:** Add detailed docstrings to the functions explaining the expected input and output types.  This is vital for usability.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the functions work as expected for different cases, especially edge cases and error scenarios.


By addressing these considerations, you'll create more robust and maintainable functions for parsing product data.
