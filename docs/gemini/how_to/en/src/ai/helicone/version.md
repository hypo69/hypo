How to use the `hypotez/src/ai/helicone/version.py` file

This Python file defines variables related to the project's version, settings, and other metadata. It aims to retrieve these details from a `settings.json` file within the project's `src` directory.  If `settings.json` is not found or has an invalid format, it defaults to certain values.

**File Structure (Example):**

```
hypotez/
└── src/
    └── ai/
        └── helicone/
            └── version.py
            └── settings.json
```

**`settings.json` Example:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "HypotezAI",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "The Hypotez Team",
  "copyright": "2024 Hypotez",
  "cofee": "https://www.example.com/donate-coffee"
}
```

**`version.py` Explanation:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable is set to 'dev', suggesting this is likely for development mode.

* **`settings` Variable:** This attempts to load settings from `settings.json`.

    * **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial. If `settings.json` doesn't exist or has incorrect JSON format, the script won't crash. Instead, it defaults to using the provided values.
* **Project Metadata:**
    * `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__`  are variables that store project-related information. These are populated from the `settings.json` if it exists and is valid.  Otherwise, default values are set (e.g., 'hypotez' for `__project_name__`, empty strings for other fields, and a default coffee link).

**How to Use:**

You would not normally directly interact with this file. Instead, other parts of your application would import and use these variables from the `version.py` file. For example, if another file needed the project version:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.helicone.version import __version__

print(f"Project version: {__version__}") 
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **`__root__`:** The code uses `__root__`.  This likely represents a special variable in your project's structure, indicating the base directory.  You need to ensure `__root__` is correctly defined in your project.  You will need to adapt this if your file path structure is different.


* **`settings.json` Location:** Make sure the `settings.json` file is correctly placed relative to the `version.py` file's location.

* **`venv`:** The shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`) are for specifying the Python interpreter used when running the script; this is relevant only for the script itself.

By correctly configuring `settings.json` and ensuring the necessary variables are defined (like `__root__`), you can easily access information like your project name and version.
