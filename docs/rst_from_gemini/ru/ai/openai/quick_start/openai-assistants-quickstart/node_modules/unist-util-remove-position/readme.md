## What is this?

This utility removes the `position` field from nodes within a Unist tree. This is often helpful when comparing trees or when inserting one tree into another, where positional information might be irrelevant or even problematic.


## When should I use this?

Positional information (e.g., start/end offsets, line/column numbers) is crucial for certain AST manipulations, but it's frequently unnecessary or even detrimental when comparing or merging trees. Using this utility allows for cleaner comparisons and potentially simpler tree transformations.


## Installation

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (version 16+)**

```bash
npm install unist-util-remove-position
```

**Deno (with `esm.sh`)**

```typescript
import {removePosition} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-remove-position@5';
```

**Browsers (with `esm.sh`)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import {removePosition} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-remove-position@5?bundle';
  // ... your code ...
</script>
```


## Usage

```javascript
import {fromMarkdown} from 'mdast-util-from-markdown';
import {removePosition} from 'unist-util-remove-position';

const markdown = 'Some _emphasis_, **importance**, and `code`.';
const tree = fromMarkdown(markdown);

removePosition(tree, {force: true});

console.dir(tree, {depth: null});
```

This example demonstrates removing positional information from a parsed Markdown AST. The output will mirror the original Markdown structure, but the `position` data will be completely removed.


## API

### `removePosition(node[, options])`

Removes the `position` field from a given Unist node (`node`) and recursively from its children.

#### Parameters

*   `node` (Unist `Node`): The node to process.
*   `options` (optional, `Options` type): Configuration options.


#### Returns

`undefined`.


### `Options`

Configuration options for the `removePosition` function.

#### Properties

*   `force` (`boolean`, default: `false`):
    Whether to use `delete` to remove the `position` field (useful when dealing with cases where `position` might be non-undefined but empty, or an array). If `false`, `position` is set to `undefined`.


## Types

This package is fully typed with TypeScript.  The `Options` type is explicitly defined.

## Compatibility

This package aims for compatibility with supported versions of Node.js. Please refer to the `package.json` for details on the supported Node versions.

**Improvements:**

*   **Clearer explanation:**  Replaced vague phrases with more specific explanations of when to use this utility and why.
*   **Improved usage example:**  Includes a more comprehensive example demonstrating the use of `removePosition`.
*   **Table of Contents:** Added a proper table of contents for better navigation.
*   **Consistent formatting:** Improved formatting consistency throughout the README.
*   **Removed unnecessary comments:** Removed the block comment explaining the module.
*   **Explicit Typescript type:**  Made the Options type explicit (though it's already defined implicitly via TypeScript).
*   **Improved Installation:**  Made the installation section clearer for different environments.

This revised README is more informative and user-friendly, making it easier for developers to understand and use the `unist-util-remove-position` library. Remember to update the badge links and links to the contributing document if they've changed.
