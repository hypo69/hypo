**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mocking:** Introduced fixtures `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` to create temporary mock files for testing. This isolates the tests from the real files, preventing side effects and making them repeatable.
* **Error Handling:** Added tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings and README loading.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **Edge Cases:** Included a test (`test_set_project_root_marker_not_found`) to check the case where the specified marker files are not found.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved the test names for better readability and understanding of their purpose.
* **Path Handling:** Used `Path` objects consistently for file paths, improving code clarity and portability (works across different operating systems).
* **Teardown:** Added a `teardown_module` function to automatically delete the created mock files after all tests in the module are run. This prevents file clutter and ensures that the test environment is clean.
* **Multiple Markers:** The test `test_set_project_root_multiple_markers` now uses `tmpdir` from pytest to create temporary directories for testing.
* **Initial Directory:** The tests now correctly handle the case where the marker files are not found in any parent directory, returning the current directory as expected.

This revised solution addresses the original prompt's requirements more completely, providing better test coverage, isolation, and error handling. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, and `json`.  You might also need `tmpdir` from `pytest`, which is a fixture useful for creating temporary directories. You can install it with `pip install pytest`.
