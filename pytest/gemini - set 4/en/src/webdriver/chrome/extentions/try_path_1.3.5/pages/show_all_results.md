```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily relies on mocking.  Instead of trying to interact directly with the browser's DOM or other external resources, we mock `tryxpath` and its `functions`.  This is crucial because the tests are now unit tests, focusing on the JavaScript functions themselves, not on the browser environment.

2. **Error Handling:**  The `test_show_all_results_error_in_updateDetailsTable` test demonStartes how to catch exceptions raised by the mocked `onError` function, crucial for testing error handling.  It's a very important part of good testing and ensures that the JS function does not crash unexpectedly.

3. **`js2py` Integration:**  The code uses `js2py` to execute the JavaScript code within a Python environment, so we can test it without running in a browser context.  This approach was essential to create unit tests that run in a python environment.

4. **Complete Test Coverage:** The tests now cover some valid input cases, no context cases, empty input cases and cases in which an error could be thrown within the JS code.   Further test cases are needed for `makeTextDownloadUrl`, `makeInfoText`, `makeConvertedInfoText` (as requested), and any other relevant functions.

5. **Clearer Comments:** The comments now clearly indicate what each test case is aiming to achieve and what types of inputs should be tested (e.g., valid input, no context, errors).

**Crucial Considerations:**

* **`tryxpath` and `fu`:**  Make sure you have appropriate mock objects defined in the `tryxpath` and `fu` to correctly simulate the external JavaScript library and functions, or use mocks provided by the actual library if it's possible.
* **`execute_js_code` Function:** This crucial function handles running JS in Python and catches any exceptions, making testing much safer.
* **External Dependencies:** Some of the functions (likely) depend on libraries for things like file handling.   You will need to adapt the test based on what libraries are in use.
* **Boundary Cases:** Add more tests for boundary conditions, like very large datasets, unusual input values, etc., which are often where bugs hide.
* **Error Handling:**  Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms in your tests.


This significantly improved answer focuses on creating unit tests that are independent of a browser environment, making testing much more manageable and reliable. Remember to tailor these tests to the actual functionality and error handling of the JavaScript code and the mocks needed for the libraries. Remember to adapt the mocks to reflect the actual functions in the original code and add tests for other JavaScript functions that you need to test.
