How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a variable named `MODE` and sets its value to 'dev'.  The comments indicate that it's part of the `revai` module and provides API access documentation links.  It likely sets the operating mode for a program or module that interacts with a Rev.com API.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block defines a variable named `MODE`.
2. It assigns the string value 'dev' to the `MODE` variable.
3. The code includes docstrings to provide details about the module's purpose, platform compatibility, and API documentation links for external reference.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os

    # This assumes you have the necessary imports for interacting with a Rev.ai API.
    # ... other imports ...


    # Check the current mode
    print(f"Current mode: {MODE}")

    #  Example usage within a larger function
    def my_function():
        if MODE == 'dev':
            #Perform actions specific to the development mode
            print("Running in development mode.")
            # ...your code...
        else:
            # Perform actions specific to other modes (e.g., production)
            print("Running in another mode.")
            # ...your code...

    # Call the function
    my_function()


    # Output will likely depend on how you integrate this code into your larger application.
    # For example it will likely print something like:
    # Current mode: dev
    # Running in development mode.
