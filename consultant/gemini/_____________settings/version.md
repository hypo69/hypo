**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original code had a blank placeholder `_____________settings`.  This was the only significant problem flagged by the code checker.  I've filled the placeholder with the correct directory name: `settings`.

**Further Considerations (though not strictly part of the code checker's task):**

* **File Structure:**  A directory named `settings` is a common and logical place to store configuration files.  Ensure that the rest of your project structure adheres to common practices for clarity and maintainability.

* **Versioning:** Consider using a proper versioning system like semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.3` instead of `v1.1`).  This makes it easier to track changes and understand dependencies.

* **Documentation:** While the `__doc__` and `__details__` are present, consider adding more detailed documentation explaining the purpose of the file and the variables.

* **Best Practices:**  Python's `__init__.py` files are often used to initialize packages.  If this `version.py` file is part of a larger module or package, it might be more appropriate to place it within a dedicated `__init__.py` file (in a `settings` directory), which contains an import statement for the variable.

This revised code is more robust and consistent with Python best practices, which would be important if this code was part of a larger, maintained project.
