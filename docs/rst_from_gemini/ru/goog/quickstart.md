**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during authentication and API calls.  This is crucial for robust code.  The error messages are more informative.
* **Pathlib:** Using `Pathlib` ( `from pathlib import Path`) for better cross-platform path handling.
* **Explicit `str(token_path)`:**  Critically, the `str()` call was added to `Credentials.from_authorized_user_file` to correctly pass a string representation of the path to the function.  This solves a common issue with pathlib paths.
* **`__init__.py` Import:** The import of `gs` from `__init__.py` is essential.  It properly establishes the relationship between the files.
* **Sample Data Formatting:** Changed `SAMPLE_CODE` and `SAMPLE_MANIFEST` to use multiline strings.  This is more readable and less prone to errors.  Used format strings for even better readability, particularly for `SAMPLE_MANIFEST`.
* **Improved File Upload:** Created a list to hold file upload data. This makes the code cleaner and more flexible.
* **Informative Error Messages:** Improved error messages to provide more details, including the error content for debugging.

**Before running:**

1. **`credentials.json`:** Ensure you have a `credentials.json` file in the same directory as your script. This file contains your Google Apps Script API credentials.
2. **`venv`:**  Make sure your `venv` is activated.
3. **`__init__.py`:**  Make sure there's a file named `__init__.py` in the `hypotez/src/goog` directory.


These improvements make the code much more robust and user-friendly. Remember to handle potential errors gracefully in production code. Always investigate the error message when something goes wrong!
