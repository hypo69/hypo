# Changes Made

*   Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Added a docstring to the `test_enrich_content` function, specifying the function's purpose and return type.
*   Used `from src.logger import logger` to import the logger.
*   Added a `try...except` block around the enrichment process to handle potential errors gracefully and log them using `logger.error`.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific terms.
*   Added descriptive comments to explain the code's purpose.
*   Concisely formatted comments using RST for documentation.
