```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly indicate the type of input and the expected behavior (e.g., `test_PrestaShop_method_valid_input`).

2. **Specific Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (`TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc.) raised by the `PrestaShop` class, which is crucial for robust testing.  Includes more descriptive assertions within the `with` block.

3. **Example Assertions:** Added basic assertions (`isinstance`, `==`, `is None`) as examples. Replace these with assertions that match the expected output of your `PrestaShop` class's methods.

4. **Edge Case Tests:** Added a `test_PrestaShop_method_edge_case` to demonstrate how to test edge cases.

5. **Missing `PrestaShop` class:**  Crucially, the provided code only imports the `PrestaShop` class, but doesn't define it.  The solution assumes it exists, and expects it to have the functionality for methods to be tested.  You **must** provide the actual definition of the `PrestaShop` class to run these tests properly.  Add the actual Python code for the `PrestaShop` class, and replace the example assertions with the correct checks for its return values and possible exceptions.

**How to Use:**

1. **Place the Actual `PrestaShop` class:** Copy and paste the actual Python code for the `PrestaShop` class within the `input_code` section of your original prompt.
2. **Run the tests:**  Use `pytest` to run the test file.

**Example `PrestaShop` class (Illustrative):**

```python
from .api import PrestaShop

class PrestaShop:
    def __init__(self, mode='dev'):
        self.mode = mode
    def get_products(self, category_id):
        if not isinstance(category_id, int):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input: Category ID must be an integer.")
        if category_id == 0:
            return []  # Example edge case
        return [{"id": 1, "name": "Product 1"}] # Example valid output
```


This example `PrestaShop` class demonstrates how to include error handling within a method.  The updated test cases will catch these errors effectively when run.  Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual class. Remember to install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
