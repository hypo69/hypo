#  No Python code to test, so no fixtures or specific functions to test.
#  This HTML file is a front-end interface, and the tests should focus on
#  the JavaScript and AngularJS interactions.  Since the file doesn't have
#  any Python-level functions, the following are dummy tests for the
#  general AngularJS structure


def test_angular_module_exists():
    """Checks if the Angular module exists."""
    # This test checks if the module is defined in the JavaScript.
    # You would need to parse the HTML or use another approach to
    # directly access the JavaScript content.
    # In this case, the module is present; replace with appropriate
    # assertions based on the module's contents.

    # Dummy assertion
    assert True, "Angular module exists"


def test_ask_model_function_exists():
    """Checks if the askModel function exists."""
    #This test verifies the askModel function is defined
    # in the JavaScript controller.

    # Dummy assertion
    assert True, "askModel function exists."


def test_train_model_function_exists():
    """Checks if the trainModel function exists."""
    #This test verifies the trainModel function is defined
    # in the JavaScript controller.

    # Dummy assertion

    """ Checks if the angular $http calls use the correct endpoints."""
    # This is a crucial test to verify the correctness
    # of the AJAX requests.  It checks that the

    #  Requires accessing the HTML file's JS content.

    #Dummy assertion

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Python Code to Test:** The provided HTML file contains JavaScript and AngularJS code, not Python.  Therefore, Python testing cannot directly test the HTML.  The tests above are *dummy* tests for the JavaScript structure, not the logic of any Python functions.

2. **Mock AngularJS (`$http`) Service:**  To thoroughly test the `$http` calls, you'd need to use a mocking framework like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`. You would mock the `$http` service, simulate a response (success or failure), and verify that the appropriate JavaScript code is executed based on the mocked response.

3. **Angular Testing Frameworks:** For proper AngularJS testing, use a testing framework for Angular.

4. **HTML Parsing (if needed):**  You could parse the HTML file to extract JavaScript code for testing if you need to verify the JavaScript.

5. **Assertions:** Replace the `assert True` statements with appropriate assertions based on the expected behavior of the AngularJS code.  The code provided is just an example of what a set of tests *might* include.  You would need to inspect the AngularJS code to write specific tests, such as asserting the values of `vm.response` or `vm.jobId` based on different inputs.

6. **Dummy Assertions:** The `assert True` statements are crucial placeholders indicating the testing structure.  You should replace them with assertions that match expected behavior based on the logic of the AngularJS controller.


This revised answer now accurately addresses the limitations of the input code and gives a framework for testing the *JavaScript* part of the file, which is the essential part that Python `pytest` can't directly interact with.  Focus on what Python can test, which is the Python backend if it exists, and use appropriate testing approaches for the JavaScript.
