# hypotez/src/suppliers/ksp/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is a subclass of the `Graber` class from the `src.suppliers` module.  It handles the specific logic for extracting product data from `ksp.co.il`.  It includes decorators for handling pop-up windows and functions to extract various product attributes, such as product ID, names, descriptions, etc.  It leverages the `src` module for general functionality and logger facilities.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class inherits from `Grbr` (likely from `src.suppliers`) and is specialized for gathering product information from `ksp.co.il`.  It provides functions to retrieve various product details.

**Attributes**:
- `supplier_prefix`: A string identifier for the supplier, set to `'ksp'`.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the Graber instance.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance for interacting with the web page.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`: (Possible general exception raised during initialization.)

#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: Asynchronously gathers product data from the web page.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance for interaction.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product data.  (The `ProductFields` type is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project.)

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: If an error occurs during execution of a locator (e.g., pop-up close).
- `Exception`: (Generic exception handling, though specific exception types might be more appropriate in production.)


## Functions

### `close_pop_up(value: Any = None) -> Callable`

**Description**: Creates a decorator for closing pop-up windows.

**Parameters**:
- `value` (Any, optional): An optional value for the decorator. Defaults to `None`.

**Returns**:
- `Callable`: The decorator function that can be used to wrap other functions.


## Notes

- The code contains extensive placeholder comments for various data fetching functions (`id_product`, `description_short`, etc.).  These should be replaced with the actual data extraction logic.
- The code includes significant sections which are commented out. This likely represents optional functionality that has been disabled, or a design decision to have modular/replaceable fetching logic.
-  The use of `async def` and `await` indicates asynchronous operations for optimal use of web scraping capabilities within the limited resource pool.
- The docstrings are consistent with the required format, including parameter descriptions, return values, and possible exceptions. However, specific exception types (e.g., `asyncio.TimeoutError`) could be added where appropriate for robustness and debugging.
