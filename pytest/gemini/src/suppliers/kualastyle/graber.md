```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` class and `logger`. This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the `Graber` class from external dependencies like the actual WebDriver.

2. **Fixtures:**  Fixtures are properly defined (`driver`, `graber`). This makes the tests more organized and reusable.

3. **Asynchronous Tests:** Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to handle the asynchronous nature of the code, which is good practice.

4. **Comprehensive Tests:** Tests are added for `Graber.__init__` covering the `supplier_prefix` and Context initialization.

5. **`test_close_pop_up_decorator`:** This now tests the decorator with and without a locator, simulating a more real-world situation.

6. **Error Handling:** The `test_graber_execute_exception` test demonstrates how to test for exceptions.  Replace `"invalid_data"` with the appropriate invalid input or scenario that your code handles.

7. **Realistic Test Case `test_graber_execute_with_driver`:** The addition of a test with a working Driver mocks a typical use case where the Graber class is expected to grab data.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Driver interaction:** The code needs to properly interact with the Driver object to fetch information. This is not addressed in the provided test case. You'll need to add more precise test functions and provide specific examples of data and expected outcomes based on the actual interactions your code has with the `Driver`.
* **Exception handling:** The code provided has no explicit exception handling.  If the `Graber` class handles exceptions, you need to test those error paths.
* **Decorator Logic:** The `close_pop_up` decorator is mocked in the test, but the actual logic of the decorator (like `Context.locator`) needs to be addressed.
* **Input Validation:** If your functions accept arguments, test with invalid/edge cases for those arguments as well.


**To make these tests even more robust:**

* **Specific input data:** Provide more tailored test cases with sample data, expected outputs, and specific edge cases that `grab_field` might encounter.
* **Assertions:**  Instead of just checking for `result == True`, include more specific assertions based on the function's expected return value.

Remember to replace the placeholder comments and adjust the tests to match the actual implementation of your functions and exception handling in the `graber.py` file.  This will produce more accurate and meaningful test cases.
