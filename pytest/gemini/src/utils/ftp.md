**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `ftplib.FTP` object to avoid actual FTP connections during testing. This significantly improves testing speed and isolation.  Crucially, the `mock_ftp_session` function is used to create and configure mock objects for different scenarios, especially for simulating errors.

2. **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly check for error cases in both the `write` and `read` functions. They use `pytest.raises` to verify that exceptions are caught and handled correctly.  This is important for testing robust error conditions.

3. **Clearer Assertions:**  More descriptive assertions are used to verify the correct behavior of the functions. For instance, in `test_write_valid_input`, an assertion checks that the `storbinary` method on the mocked session was called, demonStarting successful file transfer.  Similarly, assertions check for the absence of errors by checking if `mock_logger.error` was called.

4. **Dummy File Creation:** The `test_write_valid_input` now creates a temporary test file for testing file transfer. This approach ensures the test is running on an actual file, not just placeholder values. This temporary file is cleaned up after the test. The `test_read_valid_input` does the same for reading.

5. **`mock_ftp_session` Function:** This helper function significantly improves code organization by encapsulating the logic for creating and configuring mock FTP sessions for different scenarios. It enables you to return a mock FTP object where you can specify how the methods like `storbinary`, `retrbinary`, etc. should respond, including when to raise exceptions.

6. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** The `test_read_file_not_found` test covers the crucial scenario where the file might not exist on the FTP server. This is a very important edge case for real-world applications.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the tests in a file named `test_ftp.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `ftp.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_ftp.py
    ```

This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and realistic in its approach to testing the `ftp` module.  It demonStartes a better understanding of testing best practices, especially by using mocks and thoroughly checking for expected behavior and exceptions. Remember to adjust file paths and error conditions to match your actual file system and FTP server setup. Remember to replace `"test_file.txt"` with the appropriate name, if different.
