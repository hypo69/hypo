**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Introduced `client_data` and `request_data` fixtures to better organize test data. This improves code readability and reduces code duplication.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose of each test case.
* **pytest.raises:** Used `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions, such as invalid request IDs, which is crucial for robust testing.
* **Valid Input Test:** Added a test case (`test_execute_valid_input`) to verify a successful execution with valid input.  Critically, it asserts that the `response.type` is one of the expected types.  Also validates `response.code`.
* **Invalid Request ID Test:** Added `test_execute_invalid_request_id` to test error handling for an invalid request ID. This is a critical edge case.
* **Invalid Request Object Test:** Added `test_execute_invalid_request` to verify correct error handling if `request_data` is not an instance of `IopRequest`.
* **Request Validation:** A `test_request_validation` example test illustrates testing possible issues with the `IopRequest` itself.
* **API Parameter Check:** Added `test_api_param_addition` to validate the `add_api_param` method.
* **Error Handling:** Tests now look for specific error messages, which helps pinpoint the root cause of errors during testing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Mocking:**  If the `client.execute` function interacts with external APIs, consider using `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to mock the external calls to isolate the tests.
* **API Documentation:** Thoroughly review the documentation of the `iop` library to understand possible input values, error codes, and expected output types.  This is essential for comprehensive test coverage.
* **Response Data:** Add assertions to validate the content of the `response.body` to ensure that the data returned by the API is in the expected format.
* **More Comprehensive Error Testing:** Add more tests for different possible error scenarios, including network issues and timeouts.

This improved set of tests is more comprehensive and robust, covering various input scenarios and exception handling, which are key aspects of good test design. Remember to adapt these tests based on the specific requirements and error handling of the `iop` library. Remember that you need the actual `iop` library code to have complete tests.
