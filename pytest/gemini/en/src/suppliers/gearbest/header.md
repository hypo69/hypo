**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

2.  **Dummy File Creation (and cleanup):** The `test_set_project_root_valid_input` test now creates dummy `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files for testing. It is critical to clean up these files after the test. This prevents tests from interfering with each other and ensures that the test environment is reset for every test run. This is now included in other relevant tests.

3.  **Edge Case for No Files:** `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` added to check if the function correctly handles the scenario when no marker files are found in the directory structure.

4. **Edge Case for Non-existent File:** `test_set_project_root_marker_file_doesnt_exist` checks what happens when the marker file specified doesn't exist.

5. **Checking sys.path Modification:** `test_set_project_root_root_in_sys_path` now verifies that the project root directory is added to `sys.path` if it wasn't already present. This is a crucial aspect of the function.

6. **Multiple Markers Test:** Added a test, `test_set_project_root_multiple_markers`, to verify that the function works correctly when multiple marker files are specified.


This revised solution addresses the missing test cases, improving the comprehensiveness and robustness of the test suite.  Remember to adapt the file paths to your specific project structure if necessary.  Also,  the tests now include essential cleanup steps to prevent issues with file existence.
