**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import `logging` and `os`:**  Added necessary imports for handling logging and file operations.
* **`TEST_LOG_FILE` constant:**  Creates a constant for the log file path, making it easier to manage.  This is _critical_ for keeping your test runs isolated.
* **`test_mode_is_set`:**  A simple test to ensure `MODE` is defined and checks its value.
* **`test_log_message_to_file` and others:** Use `caplog` from pytest to capture logged messages, making tests robust.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors.  This is extremely important.
* **File Cleanup:** Included `pytest_sessionfinish` to remove the temporary log file.  This is crucial for test runs not clobbering previous runs.
* **Fixtures:**  Introduced `test_logger_fixture` to encapsulate and reuse the logger instance, improving code organization.
* **Comprehensive testing:** The tests now cover `info`, `error`, `warning`, `critical`, and `exception` logging levels.
* **Edge case (ValueError):** Added a test specifically for exceptions, demonstrating correct logging of exception details.


**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
3.  Put the `logger.py` file from the prompt in the `hypotez/src/bots/telegram` directory.
4.  Run `pytest test_logger.py` from your terminal.

This improved solution addresses the requirements and provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `logger.py` code. Remember to adapt `TEST_LOG_FILE` if your log file has a different location.  Using `caplog` is essential for robust logging tests.
