**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Skip Markers:** The `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators are crucial.  They prevent the tests from running when the code under test is incomplete (as in this example). This avoids spurious failures.

2. **Assumptions and Placeholders:** The code now includes placeholder tests (`test_crawlee_python_method_example`, etc.). Replace the `...` and the skip reason with the actual method calls and assertions that your `CrawleePython` class provides.

3. **Comprehensive Test Types:** The example now includes tests for:
   - **Valid input:**  `test_crawlee_python_mode_is_dev`
   - **Invalid/Unexpected input:** `test_crawlee_python_invalid_input`
   - **Boundary case:** `test_crawlee_python_boundary_case`
   - **Exception Handling:** `test_crawlee_python_invalid_input_raises_exception`

4. **Realistic Example:** The example assumes a method `some_method` exists; replace this with the actual methods of your `CrawleePython` class. Replace placeholders like `expected_result` with the actual expected results of your methods.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Complete the `CrawleePython` Class:**  Implement the `CrawleePython` class with appropriate methods and attributes based on your code.

2. **Replace Placeholders:** Change the example method names, assertions, and expected results to match your actual methods and expected outcomes.

3. **Run the tests:**  Place this test file (e.g., `test_crawlee_python.py`) in the same directory as your `CrawleePython` module, and run `pytest test_crawlee_python.py`.


By following this structure and filling in the details with your actual code, you'll have a robust test suite for `CrawleePython`. Remember to tailor the tests to the specific functionality of the class. Remember to remove `@pytest.mark.skip()` once your actual methods exist.
