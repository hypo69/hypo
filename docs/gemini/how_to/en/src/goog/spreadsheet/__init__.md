## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/__init__.py

This module provides access to Google Spreadsheet functionality.  It imports classes for interacting with spreadsheets, including general spreadsheet interaction and a specific type of interaction called `ReachSpreadsheet`.

**Key classes:**

* **`Spreadsheet`:** A general-purpose class for interacting with Google Spreadsheets.  The exact functionality will depend on the implementation within the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/spreadsheet.py` file.  Further documentation for this class should be referenced in that file's corresponding docstring.

* **`ReachSpreadsheet`:** A specialized class likely designed for specific interactions with Google Spreadsheets, possibly focusing on a particular feature set or data type.  Documentation for this class should be found in `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/reach_spreadsheet.py`.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.goog.spreadsheet import SpreadSheet, ReachSpreadsheet

# Create a Spreadsheet object.  The exact creation method depends on the implementation
# in hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/spreadsheet.py .
try:
    spreadsheet = SpreadSheet(spreadsheet_id='your_spreadsheet_id')
    # ... perform operations using the spreadsheet object (e.g., read data, write data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating Spreadsheet object: {e}")

# Example of a ReachSpreadsheet (again, illustrative and needs real usage details)
try:
    reach_spreadsheet = ReachSpreadsheet(spreadsheet_id='your_spreadsheet_id', access_token='your_access_token')
    # ... perform ReachSpreadsheet-specific operations (e.g., specific data retrieval)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating ReachSpreadsheet object: {e}")


```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The examples include `try...except` blocks.  Crucially, robust error handling is essential when interacting with external APIs like Google Sheets.  Ensure your code catches and handles potential exceptions (e.g., `spreadsheet_id` not found, invalid access tokens, network issues).

* **Authentication:**  The `ReachSpreadsheet` class likely requires appropriate authentication.  This is crucial for secure and authorized access to your Google Spreadsheet data.  Details on how to obtain and manage authentication tokens should be found in the source code for `ReachSpreadsheet`.

* **Specific Functionality:**  The `Spreadsheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` classes have their respective capabilities. Refer to the detailed documentation within `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/spreadsheet.py` and `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/reach_spreadsheet.py` for complete details.


**Further Documentation:**

*  Examine the docstrings within `spreadsheet.py` and `reach_spreadsheet.py` for detailed class usage, parameters, and return values. These should provide the most accurate details on how to interact with the spreadsheet classes.


**MODE = 'dev':**  This constant likely indicates that the code is in a development phase, and further adjustments or improvements may be present.


This guide is a starting point.  To create truly effective usage examples, you need the detailed implementation inside the `spreadsheet.py` and `reach_spreadsheet.py` modules.  The docstrings within those files will be invaluable.
