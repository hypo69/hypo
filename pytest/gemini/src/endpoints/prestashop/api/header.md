```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Dummy Data:**  Crucially, fixtures are used (`dummy_settings_json`, `dummy_settings_file`, `dummy_readme_file`) to provide pre-created test data, simplifying the tests and avoiding external file dependencies.  This isolates the tests and makes them more reliable.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better reflect the purpose.

3. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests now include cases for different marker files, ensuring handling of edge cases like missing files.

4. **Exception Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.

6. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** This is crucial for creating temporary directories for testing the file operations without affecting your project's directory structure.  This is correctly used in the tests.

7. **Realistic Mock Data:**  The fixtures now create or mock the necessary files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`, `pyproject.toml`, `.git`, `requirements.txt`) in the test environment to directly feed the `set_project_root` function.  This is the crucial improvement for testing the `__root__` assignment.

8. **Assertions:** The assertions in `test_settings_loading_success` are now more targeted and meaningful. They verify that the `__root__` attribute is of the expected type (Path) after execution of the `set_project_root` function.

9. **`gs_path` Modification:** The `gs_path` variable and the file creation steps are corrected to ensure the file is written in the correct location in the test directory.

**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution provides robust, isolated tests that validate the different scenarios and potential errors within `set_project_root` and `settings` loading code. Remember to adapt these tests further based on the specifics of your use case.


**Important Considerations for Future Tests:**

- **Version Handling:**  If version comparisons are crucial, you should add a dedicated test for that logic.
- **Error Handling:** The current `except ...` blocks in the original code might not catch all possible errorsâ€”add more specific exception handling as appropriate.
- **Mocking `gs`:**  For better isolation, consider mocking the `gs` module (e.g., using `pytest-mock`) to avoid external dependencies and focus solely on the `header` module's functionality. This will be especially important if `gs` has complex dependencies or side effects.
