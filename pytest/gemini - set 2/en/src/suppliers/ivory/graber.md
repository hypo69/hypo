```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` class and its methods, making the tests independent of the actual WebDriver implementation. This is crucial for unit testing.
2. **Error Handling:** Included a test `test_grab_page_locator_error` that demonStartes how to check for specific exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
3. **Type Hinting and Assertions:** Added type hints and assertions for better clarity and testing of the expected return types and values.
4. **Edge Cases:**  The `test_grab_page_no_id_product` test checks that the `grab_page` function doesn't crash when essential parameters are missing. This is crucial for handling real-world scenarios.
5. **Clearer Test Names:**  Improved the names for better understanding of the test's purpose (e.g., `test_grab_page_valid_input`).
6. **Fixture:** A `mock_driver` fixture is defined to provide a mock driver instance for the tests.
7. **Complete Example**: Added an example `test_id_product` test to show how to test an individual method.
8. **Error Handling:** Added a test for potential `TypeError`  in `test_grab_page_missing_driver`.
9. **Decorator Test:** Included a basic test for the `close_pop_up` decorator.
10. **Import Correction:** Corrected import statements to match the example file structure.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The placeholder comments within the tests (e.g., `# Assuming id_product is set in the class`) need to be replaced with the actual expected behavior and assertions for each test method.
* **Real WebDriver Integration (if needed):**  For more comprehensive tests that cover interactions with a real browser, you'll need to integrate the Selenium WebDriver and handle the setup/teardown of the browser appropriately within the tests.
* **Driver initialization:** Added `MockDriver`'s `__init__` method with a parameter `driver_response_value` to potentially handle errors in the driver during tests.
* **Exception Handling:** Be sure to handle the specific types of exceptions that might be raised by the `graber` methods.  Replace the placeholder `Exception` in `test_grab_page_locator_error` with the correct exception type.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the tests as `test_graber.py` (or a similar name) in a directory near your code.
2. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`).  If you need a real WebDriver, install Selenium (`pip install selenium`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest -v tests/test_graber.py`


Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific function/methods you want to test.   The most important improvements were mocking and error handling.
