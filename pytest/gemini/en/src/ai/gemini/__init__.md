**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code snippet only imports a class.  My response now includes placeholder tests.  Critically, you **must** replace these with *actual* tests based on the methods and functions in your `GoogleGenerativeAI` class.  Without that, these are effectively empty tests.

2. **Error Handling:** Included a `test_google_generative_ai_invalid_input` test demonstrating how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions during instantiation or method calls.  You should adapt these to the specific exceptions you expect for your class.

3. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test function names now better describe the purpose of each test.

4. **Robustness:**  The example tests show how to check for both valid and *invalid* inputs, crucial for thorough testing.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the placeholders in the example tests (e.g., `some_method`, `expected_result`, `invalid_input`) with the actual methods, expected results, and invalid inputs your `GoogleGenerativeAI` class has.

2. **Run the Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the test suite.


**Crucially**: If your `GoogleGenerativeAI` class doesn't have methods, you'll need to remove or adapt the corresponding test functions.  The most important part is to test *methods* (or functions) within the class, not just the class instantiation.  Without those methods, there's little to test. Remember to install pytest: `pip install pytest`. Then run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.
