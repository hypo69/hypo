**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Considerations:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `logger` and `driver.get_url` methods. This is essential for isolating tests and avoiding external dependencies (e.g., interacting with a real Facebook website).  This is critical for preventing flaky tests and ensuring reproducibility.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to check for `FileNotFoundError` (crucial), ensuring robustness.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Added a test (`test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_empty_input`) for an empty campaign list, and a test (`test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_invalid_campaigns`) for cases where input might be non-string.
* **File Existence Check:** The `test_file_exists_mock` is a crucial addition. It verifies that `katia_homepage.json` exists when `FacebookPromoter` is instantiated, catching potential `FileNotFoundError`.  This is extremely important for real-world applications. The code now also cleans up the created dummy file after the test.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings explain the purpose of fixtures and test functions, enhancing readability.
* **Correct Import:** Corrected the import for `FacebookPromoter` in the test.

**Before Running the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Create a dummy `katia_homepage.json` file** in the same directory as your test file for testing. This file is required for the `FacebookPromoter` class to execute properly. An empty JSON file works here.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and realistically reflects how one would write testable Python code in a production environment. Remember to adapt the mock fixture to match the actual implementation of `Driver`.
