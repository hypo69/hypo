""" module: src.endpoints.prestashop.api_schemas """
"""  Schemas for building Prestashop API

This module contains the API schemas for interacting with the Prestashop API.  
It defines the data structures used for requests and responses, promoting consistency and easier management of the API interaction.

Example Usage:

```python
from .product import ProductSchema  # Import a schema from the module
```
"""

# Import any necessary schemas from submodules here (e.g., product, category)
# Example:
# from .product import ProductSchema
# from .category import CategorySchema
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring is now more descriptive and informative. It clearly states the purpose of the module, explains what it contains, and provides a concise example of how to use it.  Importantly, it mentions the *expected* usage of importing schemas from submodules within this module.

2. **Placeholder Import Statements:** The example `from .product import ProductSchema` and `from .category import CategorySchema` is crucial.  It demonstrates that this module is likely part of a larger structure.  This is a critical aspect for maintainability and organization.  Without these placeholder imports, a user trying to use the module would see errors if those schemas don't exist.  You absolutely need to replace these placeholders with the actual imports from your schemas.  

3. **Clearer Purpose:** The docstring now highlights the module's role in facilitating communication with the Prestashop API.

4. **Example Usage:** The example code now provides a practical illustration of how a schema might be imported from this module.

5. **PEP 8 Compliance:** The docstring is formatted according to PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

**How to use this improved `__init__.py`:**

1. **Create submodules:** Create files like `product.py`, `category.py`, etc., within the `api_schemas` directory.

2. **Define schemas:** In these submodules, define your schemas (e.g., using `marshmallow`, `Pydantic`, etc.).

3. **Import in `__init__.py`:**  Import the schemas from the submodules into the `__init__.py` file as demonstrated in the example.

**Example `product.py`:**

```python
from marshmallow import Schema, fields

class ProductSchema(Schema):
    id = fields.Integer()
    name = fields.String()
    price = fields.Float()
```

This example demonstrates using `marshmallow` for schema definition.  Replace `marshmallow` with your preferred schema library.

By implementing this structure, you've created a robust and easily maintainable system for managing your PrestaShop API schemas. Remember to replace the placeholder imports with the actual imports to your defined schemas from their respective files. Remember to install your schema library (e.g., `pip install marshmallow`).
