**Issues:**

* **PEP 8 Violation (naming):** The variable name `__details__` should be `__details__`.  It's unnecessarily using the double underscore prefix, which typically indicates a private attribute.


* **PEP 8 Violation (blank lines):** There are excessive blank lines within the docstrings, making the docstrings less readable.


* **PEP 8 Violation (docstring format):** Docstrings should be on one line if concise, otherwise use multiline docstrings, with a summary line, one or more blank lines, and then a detailed description.


* **Possible PEP 8 Violation (incorrect multiline docstring):** The multiline docstrings are not formatted consistently.


* **Possible Import Issue:** The import `from .openai_trаigner import AssistantMainWindow` may be problematic.  `trаigner` is not a standard Python identifier (it should be `trainer` or a more descriptive name).  Case-sensitivity of Python means that `openai_trаigner` might not match the actual filename.  This could be causing an import error.



**Recommendations:**

1. **Correct the import:**
   ```python
   from .openai_trainer import AssistantMainWindow
   ```
   Ensure the file `openai_trainer.py` exists in the `hypotez/src/gui` directory.


2. **Improve docstrings:**
   ```python
   """
   Module containing GUI components for the Hypotez application.

   """

   from packaging.version import Version
   from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__

   from .openai_trainer import AssistantMainWindow
   ```


3. **Remove unnecessary underscores in `__details__`:**
   ```python
   from .version import __version__, __doc__, details
   ```
   Using `details` directly is preferred to `__details__` because it is more Pythonic and avoids an unnecessary double underscore.

4. **Fix docstring formatting:**
   Ensure your docstrings are consistent and use proper multiline formatting.  An example of a more coherent docstring style is presented above.


**Further Improvements (not directly issues but good practice):**

* **Descriptive module-level docstring:**  Add a more comprehensive description of the `src.gui` module itself, explaining its purpose and contents.  This is good practice for all Python modules.
* **Type hints (optional):**  Consider adding type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.


**Example of improved `__init__.py`:**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe # <- venv win

"""
Module containing GUI components for the Hypotez application.
"""
from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, details
from .openai_trainer import AssistantMainWindow
```

By addressing these issues, the code will be more robust, readable, and maintainable. Remember to run `flake8` or similar linters to catch these issues in the future.
