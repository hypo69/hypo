How to use the `version.py` module

This guide explains how to interact with the `version.py` module, located in the `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/scenarios` directory.  It defines constants related to the module's version and other metadata.

**Understanding the Variables**

The file contains several variables, each serving a specific purpose:

* **`__version__`:**  This string variable stores the version number of the module.  In this example, the value is `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`.  This is likely a custom versioning scheme.

* **`__name__`:**  This variable holds the name of the module.  When the script is run directly (not imported as a module), this will be `"__main__"`.

* **`__doc__`:**  This is a multiline string containing the module documentation.  Note the inconsistent and often incomplete docstrings that lack useful descriptions.  It would be beneficial to add detailed information about the module's purpose and functionality within each docstring block.

* **`__details__`:**  This string variable provides additional details about the module's version.  "Details about version for module or class" is a placeholder and should be updated with more specific information.

* **`__annotations__`:** This variable is declared but not populated.  In Python, you would use this to define type hints for variables and functions within the module.

* **`__author__`:** This variable contains the author(s) of the module. In this case, 'hypotez'.

**How to Access the Variables**

To access the variables from within another Python script, import the `version` module:

```python
import hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.scenarios.version as version

print(version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(version.__name__)   # Output:  (the name of the module)
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Docstring Improvements:**  The docstrings are very basic.  Providing clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for maintainability and understanding the module's intended use.
* **Consistency:** The inconsistent use and incomplete nature of docstrings throughout the file should be improved.  Each docstring block should clearly describe what the variable or part of the code does.
* **Versioning Scheme:**  Understanding the meaning and purpose of the versioning scheme (`3.12.0.0.0.4`) is critical.  If it follows a standard scheme (e.g., semantic versioning), document it. Otherwise, provide an explanation of the version components.
* **`__annotations__`:** If type hints are needed, define them in the relevant functions and variables.

By addressing these points, the `version.py` module will become much more readable and maintainable.
