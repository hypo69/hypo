How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `post_ad` that handles the posting of an advertisement on Facebook.  It takes a `Driver` object (likely for browser automation) and a `SimpleNamespace` object containing the advertisement details (title, description, potentially image path) as input.  The function first posts the advertisement title, then optionally uploads media (an image), and finally publishes the post.  Error handling is included with a retry mechanism.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports various modules for handling different functionalities, including web interaction (`selenium`), file paths (`pathlib`), time delays (`time`), data structures (`typing`, `SimpleNamespace`), and other utilities.


2. **Load locators:** The code loads locators for interacting with the Facebook post form from a JSON file (`post_message.json`). Locators are needed for identifying UI elements on the Facebook page.


3. **Define the `post_ad` function:** This function takes a `Driver` object (`d`) and a `SimpleNamespace` object (`message`) as input.


4. **Post the advertisement title:** The `post_message_title` function is called with the `description` from the `message` object to post the title of the advertisement.  Error handling is implemented; if the posting of the title fails, the `fails` counter increments.  The script will retry up to 15 times before considering the operation failed completely.


5. **Upload media (optional):** If an `image_path` attribute exists in the `message` object, the `upload_post_media` function is called to upload the image.  The `without_captions = True` argument suggests the function doesn't include any captions in the media upload. The code also checks if the image path is valid.


6. **Publish the post:** The `message_publish` function is called to publish the entire post.


7. **Error Handling and Retry:** If any step (posting the title, uploading media, or publishing) fails, the code increments a `fails` counter.  Retrying mechanisms are in place up to a certain number of attempts.


8. **Return success or failure:** The function returns `True` if all steps are successful, otherwise, it returns `None` or implicitly `False` (due to the error handling). The `fails` counter is reset to 0 after a successful post.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from src import gs
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.scenarios.post_ad import post_ad

    # Assuming you have a driver instance 'driver' and a message object 'message'
    driver = Driver(...) # Initialize the driver object
    message = SimpleNamespace(description="This is an ad.", image_path="/path/to/image.jpg")


    # Assuming src and gs are defined in your context.
    if post_ad(driver, message):
        print("Advertisement posted successfully!")
    else:
        print("Failed to post advertisement.")

    driver.close() # Close the driver after use


**Important notes:**  The example assumes you have the necessary `Driver` object, `message` object, and the `gs` and `src` modules defined in your project.  Also, replace `/path/to/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file. The `post_message_title`, `upload_post_media`, and `message_publish` functions are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project's codebase.
