How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It then loads project settings from a `settings.json` file and optionally a `README.MD` file.  It populates various project metadata variables.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules like `sys`, `json`, `packaging.version`, and `pathlib`.

2. It defines a function `set_project_root` that takes a tuple of marker file names as input. This function recursively searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing any of the specified marker files.

3. The function sets the project root directory (`__root__`) and adds it to the Python path (`sys.path`) if it's not already present.  This ensures modules within the project can be imported.

4. It tries to load project settings from a `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory within the project root.

5. It tries to load project documentation from a `README.MD` file located in the `src` directory within the project root.

6.  It retrieves various project metadata (name, version, author, copyright, etc.) from the loaded `settings.json` data or uses default values if the file is not found or the key is missing.

7. It sets the `__root__` variable to the result of the `set_project_root` function.

8. Finally, it defines and populates variables representing project name, version, documentation, details, author, copyright, and a coffee link. These variables are available for use elsewhere in the project.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have a project structure like this:
    # project_root/
    #   pyproject.toml
    #   requirements.txt
    #   src/
    #       settings.json
    #       README.MD
    #       ... other modules ...

    # In your code:
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.header import set_project_root

    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}") # Accessing the variable defined in the code.
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Project documentation: {__doc__}")
    print(f"Coffee link: {__cofee__}")
