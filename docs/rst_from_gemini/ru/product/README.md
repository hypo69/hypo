### **product Module**: Product Management

The **product** module is responsible for managing all aspects of product data, including processing, validation, and field management. It consists of the following components:

1. **product.py**
   Manages the core logic for handling products, including operations such as creating, updating, and deleting product records. It provides functions to process product data and ensures compliance with business rules for managing products within the application.

2. **product_fields.py**
   Controls the logic related to product fields, handling field validation, formatting, and management. This module ensures that product fields meet the necessary criteria for consistent data entry, enabling accurate and efficient processing of product information.


**File Location:** `C:\Users\user\Documents\repos\hypotez\src\product\README.MD`
**Role:** `doc_creator`
```
**Improvements:**

* **`product_fields.py`**: Changed the filename to a more standard Python module name.  This is crucial for clarity and maintainability.
* **File Location and Role**: Added these details for context.  It's important to document where the file is located and what the tool/process did.


This revised documentation is more professional and accurate.  It properly separates the core logic (in `product.py`) from the field management (`product_fields.py`).  Keeping these distinct makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
