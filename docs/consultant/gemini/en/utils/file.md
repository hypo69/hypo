```

**Changes Made:**

- Added complete RST docstrings to all functions, including type hints.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` where appropriate (assuming these functions are defined in `src.utils.jjson`).
- Improved error handling and logging, using `logger` consistently.
- Added explicit type hints for all parameters, ensuring better code readability and maintainability.
- Added a new function `recursively_get_files` that utilizes `recursively_yield_file_path` to return a list of file paths. This simplifies subsequent code.  This corrects an earlier issue where the recursive file-finding logic was not returning what was expected.

This improved version is more robust, readable, and follows the requested RST formatting guidelines.  Crucially, it now correctly handles the use of `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns`, and the return values for recursive file searching are now lists of paths as requested.


**Important Considerations:**

- **`jjson` module:**  Make sure the `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` functions are correctly implemented in the `src.utils.jjson` module.  If you're using an existing library for JSON handling, adjust the code to use those functions appropriately.
- **`src.logger`:**  Ensure the `logger` object is correctly defined and initialized.  If not, the logging won't function properly.
