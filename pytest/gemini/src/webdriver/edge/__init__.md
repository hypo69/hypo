```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.webdriver.edge import Edge


# Tests for the Edge class (assuming Edge class is defined)
class TestEdge:
    # Test with valid mode
    def test_edge_valid_mode(self):
        edge = Edge(mode='dev')
        assert edge.mode == 'dev'

    # Test with invalid mode (edge case)
    def test_edge_invalid_mode(self):
        with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
            edge = Edge(mode='unknown')
        assert "Invalid mode. Allowed mode: 'dev'." in str(excinfo.value)

    # Test with missing mode (edge case) - Note: The actual behavior of the original code is undefined if mode isn't provided.
    #   So this test is a crucial one to ensure the code won't crash on unexpected inputs.
    def test_edge_missing_mode(self):
        with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
            edge = Edge()  # Missing 'mode' argument
        assert "Missing required argument 'mode'" in str(excinfo.value)

    # Test edge case for empty string as mode.
    def test_edge_empty_string_mode(self):
        with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
            edge = Edge(mode="")
        assert "Invalid mode. Allowed mode: 'dev'." in str(excinfo.value)

    # Additional tests if other methods/attributes exist in the Edge class:
    # Example:
    # def test_edge_get_driver(self, example_edge_object):
    #     # Test the get_driver method if present
    #     driver = example_edge_object.get_driver()
    #     # Assertions to verify the returned driver object
    #     assert isinstance(driver, WebDriver)
    #     # ... more assertions as needed ...



# Fixtures (if needed).  Provide example fixture to illustrate
# @pytest.fixture
# def example_edge_object():
#     return Edge(mode='dev')


# Example test using a fixture (if you have one)
# @pytest.mark.usefixtures("example_edge_object")
# def test_example_with_fixture(example_edge_object):
#     # ... tests using the fixture ...


# import time  # Add this if using time in your tests
# Example of a test involving a potentially long-running operation
# from selenium import webdriver # Replace with the actual import
# def test_long_running_operation():
#   # ... your test code that takes time to run ...


# Remember to replace WebDriver with the actual class name if needed


# Important Note:  You need to import the proper libraries like Selenium (WebDriver).  The code above assumes
# that there's a Selenium driver involved.  If there is no dependency or other object/module needed, update accordingly.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:** The code now imports the necessary `pytest` library.
2. **`TestEdge` Class:**  Tests are organized within a `TestEdge` class for better structure and readability.
3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive (e.g., `test_edge_valid_mode`, `test_edge_invalid_mode`).
4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions, which is crucial for robust error handling.  Tests for the empty string case and missing mode.
5. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests for invalid mode ('unknown'), empty string mode, and missing mode, which are critical edge cases.
6. **Example Fixture (if needed):**  The example fixture demonstrates how to create fixtures if your code requires them.  Adapt it to your specific needs.
7. **Example `test_long_running_operation` (optional but recommended):** Added example showing how to test potentially long running operations.
8. **Explicit Imports:** Include necessary imports (e.g., `from selenium import webdriver` if needed).  This is a crucial step in writing proper tests that don't encounter errors because of missing dependencies.
9. **Error Message Assertions:** The `assert` statements now include checks on the error messages from `pytest.raises`, enhancing the test's ability to pinpoint the exact issue.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Ensure you have the necessary dependencies:**  If `Edge` interacts with Selenium, install the Selenium library:
  ```bash
  pip install selenium
  ```

- **Replace placeholders:**  If your `Edge` class has other methods or attributes, update the example test cases in the `TestEdge` class to cover them.


This improved solution is more robust, addresses edge cases, and provides a better structure for testing your Python code. Remember to replace placeholder comments with the actual code from your `Edge` class to make these tests functional. Remember to also install any needed external modules, including Selenium if used.
