### **endpoints Module**: Final Consumer Endpoints

The `endpoints` module serves as a collection of endpoint modules that interact with external services and systems, acting as the main interface for data exchange with final consumers.  It includes the following submodules:

1. **prestashop**
   Provides integration with the PrestaShop e-commerce platform, supporting functions such as product and order management, enabling seamless data exchange between the application and the PrestaShop system.

2. **bots**
   Manages bot integrations, including support for platforms like Telegram and Discord. This allows user interaction, command processing, and messaging functionalities.

3. **emil**
   A submodule designed for integration with the data supplier Emil, facilitating data collection, processing, and synchronization.

4. **kazarinov**
   Integrates with the data supplier Kazarinov, supporting data gathering and processing requirements specific to this provider's systems and data structure.
```

**Changes and why:**

* **Formatting:** Improved formatting for better readability.  Used consistent Markdown formatting.
* **Word choice:** Replaced some phrases for slightly more concise and professional language. For example, "allowing seamless data exchange" is more impactful than just "supporting functions".
* **Clarity:** Added more explicit descriptions to improve understanding of each submodule's purpose. For example, clarifying that "bots" handles user interaction.
* **Specificity:** Added the word "specific" to better define what `kazarinov` is responsible for.


This revised version is more professional and easier to understand than the original.  It's also better suited for use in a project's documentation. Remember to keep the content aligned with the actual functionality of each module in your project.
