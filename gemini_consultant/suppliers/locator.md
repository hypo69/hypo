**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The `_load_locator` function now properly checks if the `locators_path` exists using `locators_path.exists()`.  This prevents a `FileNotFoundError` later in the function.  Critically, it also catches `ValueError` *within* the `_load_locator` function so that the caller doesn't get a generic `except ValueError`. This is more specific and allows the calling code to know exactly what happened, which makes debugging easier.
* **Pathlib:** The code now correctly uses `Path` objects from the `pathlib` module. This makes the code more robust when dealing with file paths, preventing common errors and makes it more Pythonic.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more informative, specifically mentioning the file that caused the error.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** Minor formatting changes for better readability (e.g., `if not ...`).

**Explanation of Changes and Why They Matter:**

- **Error handling:** The original code had a bad exception handling and could swallow FileNotFoundErrors. This corrected example makes sure to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` in a more comprehensive way, allowing better debugging and error response.
- **Pathlib:** Using `pathlib` is better for path manipulation. It avoids string concatenation and provides clearer path representation. This also helps to make your code more readable and robust.
- **`exists()` method:** Using `locators_path.exists()` is a better way to check if a file exists without actually attempting to open it, improving efficiency and robustness.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# Assuming you have your gs.path.src defined elsewhere
import os
import sys

# In your main script:
try:
    # Example usage:
    locator = Locator('my_supplier')
    print(locator.locator.my_attribute)  # Accessing a field within the loaded data
except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError) as e:
    print(f"Error creating Locator: {e}")
```

This revised version is much more robust, readable, and follows best practices for Python exception handling and file operations. Remember to install `pathlib` if you haven't already. It's included in the standard Python library, so you generally don't need to install it.
