**INSTRUCTION**:  

Analyze the provided code in detail and explain its functionality. The response should include three sections:  

1. **<input code>**: Present the given code without modifications.  
2. **<algorithm>**: Describe the workflow in a step-by-step block diagram format, include examples for each logical block, and illustrate data flow between functions, classes, or methods.  
3. **<mermaid>**: Build a code diagram in mermaid format, analyze and explain all the dependencies being imported while constructing the diagram.
4. **<explanation>**: Provide detailed explanations of:  
   - **Imports**: Their purpose and relationship with other `src.` packages.  
   - **Classes**: Their role, attributes, methods, and interactions with other project components.  
   - **Functions**: Their arguments, return values, purpose, and examples.  
   - **Variables**: Their types and usage.  
   - Highlight potential errors or areas for improvement.  

Additionally, construct a chain of relationships with other parts of the project (if applicable).  

This ensures a comprehensive and structured analysis of the code.
