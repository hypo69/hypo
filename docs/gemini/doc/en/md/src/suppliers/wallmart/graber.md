# hypotez/src/suppliers/wallmart/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, responsible for extracting product data from the Walmart supplier. It utilizes a `Driver` instance for interacting with the web and follows the general Graber structure for data extraction.  It provides asynchronous methods to fetch various product attributes and stores them in the `ProductFields` object for later use.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class encapsulates the logic for grabbing product fields from the Walmart website.  It inherits from the `Grbr` class, likely providing a standardized data extraction structure.

**Attributes**:

- `supplier_prefix`:  A string representing the supplier prefix ("wallmart" in this case).

**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes a `Graber` instance with a `Driver` object.  Sets the `supplier_prefix` and initializes the `super()` class.  Also sets `Context.locator` to `None`.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for web interaction.

#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: Asynchronously grabs the product fields for a given product.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for web interaction.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product fields.
