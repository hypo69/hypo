```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the test purpose (e.g., `test_google_generate_invalid_prompt`).

2. **Specific Assertions:** Tests now include assertions about the *type* and *content* of the results, providing more comprehensive coverage. For example, checking if the result is a string and not empty after generating text.

3. **ValueError Handling:** The tests now utilize `pytest.raises` to explicitly test for `ValueError` exceptions when encountering invalid inputs (empty prompts).  The error message is checked for correctness, which is very important.

4. **Edge Cases:** The `test_google_generate_long_prompt` tests the handling of a very long prompt, which is a crucial edge case to consider for models.

5. **Missing Code:**  Crucially, the example now includes a test case for `test_model_selection_mode`. Since the sample input doesn't define functions that alter the MODE value, this assertion shows how to test the correctness of the initialization of that attribute.

6. **OpenAI Tests:** Added test cases for `OpenAIModel`, checking for a valid prompt and empty string behavior, as well as handling potential `Exception` issues.  Important to note that real OpenAI calls usually require a valid API key, so if those calls are made in your production code this should be addressed in tests as well.


**To Use These Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_ai.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_ai.py
    ```

Remember to replace placeholders like `GoogleGenerativeAI.generate` and `OpenAIModel.generate` with the actual method names in your code. Also, adapt the tests based on the specific functionality and parameters expected in your `GoogleGenerativeAI` and `OpenAIModel` classes.


This improved solution addresses the requirements, provides more thorough test coverage, and demonstrates best practices for writing effective `pytest` tests. Remember to adapt it to the specific details of your code. Remember to mock or replace any external dependencies (like calls to OpenAI) in your tests to make them more reliable.
