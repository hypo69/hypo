Module: src.suppliers.etzmaleh.product_fields

[File's Description]: This module defines the product fields for the Etzmaleh supplier.
                    It inherits from the base ProductFields class and adds or modifies
                    fields specific to Etzmaleh products.

@namespace src: src
@package src.suppliers.etzmaleh
@file product_fields.py

@section libs Imports:
- sqlite3
- typing
- pathlib
- attr
- enum
- helpers
- gs (GlobalSettings)
- tools
- product (likely referring to a base product fields class)
- gs (likely a typo, intended to be GlobalSettings)

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Clearer Docstrings:**  Improved docstrings to provide a concise description of the module's purpose, the role of the class, and the expected behavior.  The `[File's Description]` comment is replaced with a more informative description.
* **Explicit Imports:** Imports from `src` are now more explicit (e.g., `from src.product import Product_fields`). This avoids ambiguity if you have multiple modules named `product` in different directories.  Crucially, it added `from src.suppliers.base_product_fields import BaseProductFields` to fix the inheritance issue.  This assumes that a `base_product_fields.py` exists in the `src/suppliers` directory, containing a `BaseProductFields` class. If not, you need to adjust the imports and class inheritance.
* **`BaseProductFields`:**  Added `BaseProductFields` for proper inheritance. The original code likely assumed a global variable but it's much cleaner and more maintainable to create a base class for product fields.
* **Corrected `Product_fields` Import:** Changed `from src.product import product_fields` to `from src.product import Product_fields`.  The module likely exported a class.
* **`gs` Assignment:** The GlobalSettings object (`gs`) is properly assigned to use the singleton instance, which is the standard approach.
* **`__init__` Docstring:**  The `__init__` method's docstring now explains the expected purpose and potential usage of the arguments.
* **Removed Unnecessary Code:** Removed the redundant `product_fields.ProductFields()` call; it likely was trying to initialize a class.
* **Typo Correction:** Corrected the potential typo for `gs` (used twice) to ensure that it's always consistent.

**How to use this code:**

1.  Create a `src/suppliers/base_product_fields.py` file if it doesn't exist. This file will define a base class for product fields.
2.  Ensure the correct paths are set in your `sys.path` for all the necessary modules within the `src` directory to be found by Python.

This revised code is much more robust, readable, and follows best practices for Python code.  It also provides a proper inheritance structure and clearer purpose. Remember to fill in the missing logic within the `__init__` method.
