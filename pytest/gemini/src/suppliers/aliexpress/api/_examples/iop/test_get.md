**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  `client` and `request` fixtures are crucial for isolating tests and preventing redundant setup code.  The `request_id` fixture also aids in creating testable data.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose and input type being tested.

3. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to check for expected exceptions (e.g., incorrect request ID format). This is more robust.

4. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests now include cases for valid input, invalid request ID types, missing request IDs, and  a test `test_execute_missing_request_id` for when the `request_id` parameter is absent.

5. **Type Checking:** The test now verifies that the response attributes (`type`, `message`, `request_id`, `body`) have the correct types.

6. **Error Message Validation:** The `test_execute_invalid_request_id` now asserts that the expected error message is present in the exception.


**Before Running:**

- Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
- Ensure the `iop` module is correctly imported and usable in your test environment.  If it's not in the normal import path, adjust the `import iop` line accordingly.  If the module isn't available, you'll get an `ImportError` and need to fix the module path for the tests.


This revised solution is more complete, robust, and follows best practices for writing effective `pytest` tests. Remember to adjust assertions based on the specific error handling and response format of the `iop` module.  Thorough error handling in the actual `iop` module is crucial for the tests to be truly meaningful.
