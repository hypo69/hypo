**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_valid`).

2. **Comprehensive Checks:** The tests cover more aspects: verifying the type of returned values, checking for empty strings/dictionaries, ensuring the `MODE` variable has the correct value.  Crucially, the tests now include checks for the expected *type* of the output of `__version__`.

3. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs (Important):** A parameterized test (`test_invalid_version_type`) demonstrates how to handle cases with incorrect input types for `__version__`.  This is a *crucial* addition, as it verifies that your code handles potential errors gracefully. Adapt this example to other functions if applicable.

4. **Docstrings:** Included docstrings to explain the purpose of each test case, which enhances readability and maintainability.

5. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):** The `test_invalid_version_type` example uses `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions raised by `Version` when it receives invalid input, a key part of robustness testing.


**Before Running the Tests:**

- Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
- Ensure the `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_examples/__init__.py` file exists with the provided code.

**How to Run the Tests:**

Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_firefox_examples.py`) in the same directory as your `__init__.py` file.  Then, run `pytest test_firefox_examples.py` from your terminal.

This improved set of tests is more comprehensive, addressing the requirements for exception handling and potential invalid inputs, and is a better example of robust `pytest` testing practices. Remember to tailor the tests to match the actual functionality and expected behavior of the code under test.  If `__details__` returns a more complex structure, you should add tests to verify specific fields and their types.
