# Add more tests as needed, covering various edge cases and error scenarios.
# For example, you might want tests for:
# - Different product link formats
# - Handling of potentially malformed product IDs
# - Checking for robustness against various HTTP errors
# - Testing with a mocked response for network requests (if applicable)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the input type (valid, invalid URL format, etc.) and expected behavior.

2. **Specific Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (`ValueError` for various invalid inputs and `TypeError` for non-string input) and verifies the error messages to ensure the code properly handles different error cases.

3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests include cases like empty strings, non-string input, URLs without item IDs, URLs from different domains, and malformed URLs.  This is crucial for robust testing.

4. **Conciseness and Readability:** Improved code structure for better readability.

5. **Docstrings:** Docstrings provide explanations for the purpose of each test function.

6. **Missing Implementation:**  Since the `get_product_id` function is not implemented in the provided code snippet, the tests are now written with assumptions about the function.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_tools.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_aliexpress_tools.py`

This improved test suite is more comprehensive and addresses a wider range of potential issues, making it a stronger test suite than the previous example. Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual implementation of `get_product_id` for complete testing. Remember to adapt the tests to reflect the actual API interaction of your code.
