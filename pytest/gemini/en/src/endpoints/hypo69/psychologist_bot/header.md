```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `gs.path.root` and `gs` itself.  This is crucial because the original code relies on external modules, and these tests need to isolate the logic of the `header.py` file.   The `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures create dummy files to be used in the test.


2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.

3. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Tests now cover cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` do not exist (common edge cases) using `pytest.raises` is now used to test for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` which were not handled in the original code.

4. **Fixture for Data:** `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures are added to easily create and manage the temporary files for the `settings_loading` tests.

5. **Isolation:** Tests are now completely isolated from each other and the external file system.

6. **Correct `__root__` Usage:**  The original code incorrectly assumes `__root__` is set in `set_project_root` - the tests now have the correct usage.

7. **Specific Error Checking:**  The tests now handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` may not exist, preventing `AttributeError`.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Place the provided code in a file named `header.py` inside the `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot` folder. (Make sure the `gs` module and necessary directories exist.)
3.  Save these tests in a file named `test_header.py` in the same directory as `header.py`.
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution addresses the issues and provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for the code. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py"` with the actual path to your `header.py` file if it's in a different location. Also, consider installing `packaging` if you don't have it already. Also, add a dummy `src` folder to the `tmp_path` if it doesn't exist in your environment.
