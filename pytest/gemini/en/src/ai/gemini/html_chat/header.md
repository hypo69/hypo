**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to catch potential `IndexError` if `'hypotez'` isn't found in the path. This prevents the test from crashing.

2. **Mocking:** The code now uses `os.chdir()` to create a mock current working directory for testing. This isolates the test from the actual file system and avoids side effects.

3. **Clean Up:** Critically,  `os.chdir("..")` is used after each test to restore the original working directory. This is *essential* for preventing conflicts between tests and maintaining a clean testing environment.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific about the expected type and content of `__root__`.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added a test `test_root_path_handles_no_hypotez` to cover the scenario where "hypotez" isn't part of the path.

6. **pytest `raises` (not needed here):**  Since we're testing the code for correct execution (not exceptions), `pytest.raises` isn't needed. The code now robustly handles potential errors using try/except.

7. **Readability:** The tests are well-commented to explain the purpose of each assertion.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution is much more reliable and comprehensive in testing the code's functionality, particularly the error handling in case "hypotez" is not in the path. Remember to adapt the mock current working directory ("some/path/hypotez") to reflect your expected directory structure.
