""" module: src.global_settings """
""" Project settings: passwords, server addresses, and other sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in a database in KeyPass format with a `.kdbx` extension.
To open the database, a master password is required.

Default Program Settings
The `ProjectSetting` class (`src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`) defines key configuration parameters:
- A list of suppliers that will be executed if no other is specified
- Locale - the primary language for collecting information from suppliers
- Passwords, logins, and server addresses for external connections
- Internal project paths

The class is called as a singleton instance `gs`:
```python
from __init__ import gs
"""
...

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__,  __doc__, __details__

from .credentials import gs
from .header import __root__
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original prompt lacked the crucial context of the folder structure within the `hypotez` project.  To generate a correct `__init__.py` file,  we need to know where `ProjectSetting` and `global_settings` fit into the structure.  My solution assumes a standard organization:

* **`hypotez/src/global_settings`**: This is the directory where `ProjectSettings` is likely defined.  The `__init__.py` file will be used to import and access this class.

Crucially,  the placeholder `_____________settings` is replaced with `global_settings` based on the provided description. This is a more standard and logical folder structure for project settings. This change is **essential** for code organization and maintainability.

**Why other changes are necessary (and how to address them):**

* **Missing `ProjectSettings` class:**  The code snippet mentions `ProjectSettings`, but that class is not defined. You'll need to create this class within the `global_settings` folder (e.g., `src/global_settings/global_settings.py`) to hold the project settings.  A full implementation requires code that defines `ProjectSettings` and how to access `gs`.  
* **Missing `credentials` module:** The import `from .credentials import gs` needs a file (`credentials.py`) to define `gs`.  That file would likely contain the code to access the password database and other secure credentials.



**Example structure (for more complete project):**


```
hypotez/
├── src/
│   ├── global_settings/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── global_settings.py
│   ├── ...other subfolders...
│   └── ...other modules...
├── venv/
│   └── Scripts/
│       └── python.exe
└── ...other files...
```

After this example `global_settings.py` would define `ProjectSettings`.


This revised `__init__.py` file is much more useful and aligns with Python best practices for project organization. Remember to fill in the missing `ProjectSettings` and `credentials` code to create a complete, functioning solution. Remember to replace `gs` references with a correct object or function in the credential module.
