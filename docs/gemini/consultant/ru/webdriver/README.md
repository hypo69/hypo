**Changes Made**

- Added a `try...except` block around the `main` function to catch and log any exceptions that occur during execution. This significantly improves error handling and provides more context in case of failure.
- Replaced all `print` statements with `logger.info` statements for logging.  This allows for better debugging and management of output if needed.
- Added logging for failed attempts.  For instance, if `get_url` fails, a corresponding error log is added.
- Added more descriptive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) for better documentation.
- Added `TODO` comments where necessary to indicate potential improvements or areas requiring further development, such as better error handling for `_save_cookies_localy`.
- Removed unused imports.
- Replaced `...` placeholders with appropriate error handling, logging, and comments.
- Improved the structure of the docstrings to adhere to RST standards.
