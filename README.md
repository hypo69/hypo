## Setup Instructions

### Required Software (Pre-installed on your computer)
Hereâ€™s the list of required, pre-installed software for the project:

1. **Web Browsers**: One or more of the following:
   - **Firefox**
   - **Chrome**
   - **Edge**   
   These are used in conjunction with browser drivers (in the `bin` folder) for testing and automation purposes.

2. **PowerShell**: A task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, essential for executing scripts and managing workflows, especially in Windows environments.

3. **Python 3.12**: This specific version of Python is required for the project, likely due to compatibility with certain libraries or dependencies.

4. **`npm`**: Node Package Manager for managing JavaScript project dependencies, allowing installation, updating, and managing of libraries and development tools.

# Software tools and library located in the `bin` folder:
Here's a brief overview of each software tool or library located in the bin folder:

1. **`ffmpeg.exe`**: A comprehensive tool for handling multimedia files. It's commonly used for video and audio encoding, decoding, transcoding, and streaming. It supports many formats and can convert media files, apply filters, and modify encoding settings.

2. **`chrome drivers`**: Web drivers for controlling the Google Chrome browser, mainly used for automated browser testing. These are often integrated into testing frameworks like Selenium for simulating browser interactions.

3. **`chrome for developers`**: This is a version of Google Chrome specifically for developers, often including beta or experimental features. It's useful for web development testing and debugging in real-world browser environments.

4. **`geckodriver`**: A driver for Mozilla Firefox, used to control Firefox in automated testing scenarios. It enables interaction with the Firefox browser through automation tools, allowing for cross-browser testing in conjunction with other drivers.

5. **`edge drivers`**: Drivers for Microsoft Edge browser control, useful in automated testing environments, similar to Chrome and Firefox drivers. It's part of Microsoft's WebDriver toolset and allows testing web applications in the Edge browser.

6. **`gtk`**: The GIMP Toolkit, a library for developing graphical user interfaces. Widely used in Linux applications, it provides a collection of controls and widgets for creating windows, buttons, and other interface elements.


### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```powershell
   # Set the current path
   $currentPath = (Get-Location).Path
   
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/hypo69/hypo.git
   ```
   - Navigate to the `hypotez` directory.


2. **Download the `bin` directory**:
   [Download bin directory](https://mega.nz/file/VahExTTQ#igYq3AM8W_xUDvONX3VOKM5Nx-m9pLgno-YpqCzWNPo)
   - Unzip the downloaded compressed file into the `hypotez` folder .

	Make sure to **unzip directly into the project folder**, similar to selecting "Extract Here" in a context menu. The archive already contains a `bin` folder with all necessary binaries, so unzipping it in the project root will place everything in the correct directory structure automatically.
		- Your directory structure should look like this:  <img src="imasges/bin.png" alt="`bin` directory structute">
	- - Easy Way to continue installation: 								
	Execute the install script `.\INSTALL.PS1`.

    The script will guide you through the steps to set up `hypotez` efficiently. After completion, continue to the Configuration section below to add your credentials and any other specific settings.

3. Continue to manual install:

4. **Set execution policy**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

5. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

6. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

7. **Upgrade `pip`**:
   ```powershell
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

8. **Install dependencies**:
