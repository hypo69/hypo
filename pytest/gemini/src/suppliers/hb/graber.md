**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better reflect the purpose of the test.
* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `Driver` object and the logger.  This is crucial for testing Graber without depending on actual web interactions.  This is now done in a way that's more robust than in the previous response.
* **Robust `collect_data` Testing:**  Tests `collect_data` with valid inputs, an empty return, and an exception to illuStarte error handling.  **Crucially, this example needs to be adapted to the actual `collect_data` function** to test the specific data returned or handling of particular edge cases.
* **Context Handling Tests:** `test_graber_init_with_context` is added to check that the Context is properly initialized as expected.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The test `test_collect_data_raises_exception` shows the proper use of `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions. **Replace this with your actual exceptions**
* **Fixtures:**  The code uses fixtures (`driver_instance`, `graber_instance`) to create and manage the objects being tested, improving organization and reusability.
* **Mock `close_pop_up` decorator (Example):** I've commented out the decorator test, but provided the *type* of test to illuStarte how you should adapt if you actually have a decorator function you need to test within `Graber` (which is highly probable).  You'll need to mock `execute_locator` in that situation.
* **`logger` Mocking:** The `logger` is mocked. This is good practice since you don't want tests to actually log messages.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Modify the placeholder comments (e.g., the `collect_data` example, decorator tests, etc.) with the actual methods and function calls from your `Graber` class.
2.  **Adapt Error Handling:**  Add tests for any specific exceptions that your code might raise and handle them with `pytest.raises`.
3.  **Add More Tests:**  Expand the test suite to cover all other critical functions and paths within your `Graber` class.

This improved response provides a more complete and effective testing Startegy for your Python code. Remember to adapt the specific tests to the methods and behaviors of your `Graber` class. Remember to install `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
