**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.mark.parametrize`:** This is used for parameterization, allowing you to test the `MODE` attribute with multiple valid and invalid values efficiently.  The `invalid_mode` test is a strong example of comprehensive testing.

2. **`@pytest.fixture` and `driver_fixture`:**  Critically, the `test_start_edge_driver` and `test_edge_driver_close` tests now require a `driver_fixture`.  This is a better approach than trying to instantiate the webdriver directly inside the test method.  The fixture handles setting up and tearing down the driver, isolating tests and preventing potential issues.  The example `driver_fixture` uses `pytest.fixture(scope="function")` which is a good default scope. The placeholder `time` import and `webdriver` are needed.  REPLACE the placeholder webdriver creation with your actual WebDriver creation (using the correct library).


3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate what each test is checking.

4. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):** The `test_invalid_mode_attribute` test correctly uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected exception (`ValueError`) when an invalid mode is used.

5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The test cases are designed to cover a wider range of input types.

6. **`pytest.mark.skip`:**  The `test_start_edge_driver` and `test_edge_driver_close` are marked with `pytest.mark.skip`.  This is essential, as they depend on interacting with an actual Edge webdriver instance, which requires external dependencies like Selenium and the webdriver itself.  The `driver_fixture` approach does the necessary setup and teardown of the actual driver.


**How to Run:**

Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_edge.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/__init__.py` file.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Then run:

```bash
pytest test_edge.py
```


**Before Running the Tests:**

- **Install Selenium:**  If you haven't already, install Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

- **Download the Edge WebDriver:**  You need the correct Edge WebDriver for your version of Edge.  Download it from the Microsoft site and put it in a location where your Python code can access it. Update the path in the `driver_fixture` to your actual location.


This improved solution provides a much more robust and practical approach to testing your Edge webdriver implementation. Remember to replace the placeholder `webdriver` instantiation with your actual implementation.
