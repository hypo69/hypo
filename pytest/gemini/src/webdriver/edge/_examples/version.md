```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover `__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__annotations__`, `__author__`, and `MODE`.  Critically, it tests the type of each attribute, which is essential for robust verification.


2. **Type Checking:** Added tests to ensure that the version and other attributes are of the expected types (string, dict, etc.). This is crucial for ensuring the code's internal consistency.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive, aiding readability and understanding.

4. **Edge Case Handling (Example):** The `test_for_exceptions` function now shows an example of how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling, if applicable. The example is currently marked as a skip because no exceptions were found in the example code and is left as a placeholder.


5. **Import Handling:** The tests now use explicit imports to isolate the module and avoid potential naming conflicts.

6. **Docstrings:** All tests have informative docstrings explaining their purpose.

7. **Skip Condition:**  The test for exceptions is now marked as a skip (`@pytest.mark.skipif`) because the original code has no exception handling.  A real-world test would replace this skip with exception testing if applicable.

8. **No Redundancy:** Removed unnecessary comments and simplified the structure.

This improved test suite provides a more comprehensive and reliable set of tests for the `version.py` module. Remember to adapt and expand these tests based on the specific functionalities and potential exceptions that the module is designed to handle.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as `version.py`.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory.
3.  Run `pytest test_version.py`.


This will execute the tests, and if any fail, pytest will report the errors. Remember to replace `test_version.py` with the actual name of your test file.
