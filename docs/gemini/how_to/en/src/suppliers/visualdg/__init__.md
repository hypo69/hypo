## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/visualdg/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/visualdg/__init__.py`, is the initialization file for the `visualdg` supplier module within the `hypotez` project.  It primarily sets up imports for other parts of the supplier.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Initialization:** This file acts as a starting point, importing necessary components.
* **`MODE` Variable:**  The `MODE = 'dev'` line likely defines a configuration setting for the module. This might control behavior differently in development versus production environments.


**How to use:**

This file is not directly executed as a script.  Instead, it's imported by other modules within the `hypotez` project that need to interact with the `visualdg` supplier.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# In another file (e.g., hypotez/src/main.py)

from hypotez.src.suppliers.visualdg import Graber

# ... your code ...

graber_instance = Graber()
# ... Use the Graber class as needed ...
```

**Explanation of the code:**

* `from .graber import Graber`: This line imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` file within the `visualdg` supplier folder.  The `.` indicates a relative import.  This allows other parts of the `hypotez` project to use the `Graber` class.

**Further Considerations:**

* **`MODE` Variable Usage:**  The `MODE` variable is crucial.  The `dev` value hints at the possibility of conditional logic within the `Graber` class or other files within the `visualdg` module based on this setting.  Look for the `MODE` variable being used to determine different behavior in those files.
* **Error Handling:** If using the `Graber` class, it's recommended to include proper error handling in your code to catch potential exceptions.

**In summary:** This file is a vital part of the `visualdg` supplier's infrastructure, providing the necessary imports and potential configuration options.  The core logic and functionality will reside within the `graber.py` file, which you should explore next.
