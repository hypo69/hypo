**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Asynchronous Tests:**  Crucially, `pytest` is not inherently asynchronous. The `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator and `async def` for test functions are now included, allowing us to use `await` within the tests, which is necessary for interacting with asynchronous functions like `removeFile`.
* **Temporary File Fixture:** The `temp_file` fixture now creates a temporary file properly using `tmp_path` from `pytest`. This eliminates the need to manually create and delete files in each test, promoting test isolation.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests cover valid file removal, nonexistent file, invalid paths (testing for directories), and exception handling.  The error message is now properly captured.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_removeFile_nonexistent_file`).
* **Error Handling:** The test for exception handling now demonstrates a way to simulate a case where the file is locked and the `unlink` operation fails.
* **File Not Found Test:** The test `test_removeFile_file_not_found` now deletes the file *inside* the test using Pathlib. This ensures that the file actually does not exist when `removeFile` is called, and is a more robust way to test the case.
* **Import Statement:** Added the import statement for the `unlink` function. The original code sample assumed it was imported from 'fs/promises', which is a common module for Node.js but isn't native to Python.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Save the code:** Save the code above (with the necessary `removeFile` function) into a file named `test_utils.py`.
3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_utils.py
    ```


**Important Considerations (for real-world use):**

* **File Locking:** In a real application, you might need to handle situations where a file is locked by another process. You can't reliably simulate this in a test, but you should have code in your `removeFile` function to handle such scenarios gracefully (e.g., retrying or raising a specific exception).
* **Error Handling:** The provided example demonstrates basic error handling. In a production application, you'd likely need more sophisticated error handling, logging, and potentially retry mechanisms.  The added `file_handle` simulation in `test_removeFile_exception` is a good start, but it's a simplified model.  The handling of exceptions in production code is more complex.
* **Node.js vs. Python:** The test code is now written in Python, which is necessary for using the `pytest` framework. The original `removeFile` function is presumed to be a Node.js function; if you need to test a function from a Node.js module, you'll have to use an appropriate Node.js testing framework.



Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/bots/chat_gpt_nodejs/chatgpt_telegram/src/utils.js"` with the actual path to the `removeFile` function in your project.
