**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Asynchronous Tests:** The `pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator is crucial.  Since the `removeFile` function is asynchronous, test functions need to be decorated or explicitly use `await` inside `test_`.

2. **Temporary Files:** The `test_file_path` fixture creates a temporary file for each test, avoiding interference between tests.  This is much better than trying to manage files outside the testing framework.

3. **`invalid_file_path` Fixture:** Creates a non-existent file path, allowing for a test that explicitly checks if the function handles cases where the file does not exist.

4. **Exception Handling:** The test now correctly utilizes `pytest.raises(TypeError)` to catch the `TypeError` that should occur if an invalid data type is passed. The `TypeError` check is an important improvement.

5. **Mocking `print`:** The `@patch('builtins.print')` decorator is used to mock the print function so that the test only verifies if the error message is logged without relying on the actual output to the console. This is crucial for reliable testing.

6. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more explicit (e.g., checking if the file exists after removal).

7. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover:
   - Valid file removal.
   - Nonexistent file.
   - Exception handling (simulates errors).
   - Invalid path types (e.g., integers).
   - `None` path.


**How to Run:**

Make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_utils.py`) and run `pytest test_utils.py`.  This will execute the test suite.


**Important Note**: The `fs/promises` module is likely from Node.js, not standard Python. The tests are written assuming `unlink` is an asynchronous function. If it's a synchronous function, you will need to adapt them. If `unlink` is part of a different library, replace the import and function name accordingly in the tests. If `fs.promises` is not available, you might need to mock it with a different solution depending on the actual implementation.
