How to use the `test_enrich_content` function
=======================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This function tests the `enrich_content` method of the `TinyEnricher` class, verifying that the enriched content is significantly larger than the original content. It uses a sample document and requirements as input to the enrichment process.  The assertion checks that the enriched content length is at least three times the original content length.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** Imports `pytest`, `textwrap`, `logging`, `sys`, and the `TinyEnricher` class from the appropriate modules.  Import statements are used to add necessary paths to the Python system path.
2. **Define test data:** Creates two strings, `content_to_enrich` and `requirements`. These strings define the initial document and the requirements for enriching it.
3. **Instantiate TinyEnricher:** Creates an instance of the `TinyEnricher` class.
4. **Call the `enrich_content` method:** Calls the `enrich_content` method on the `TinyEnricher` instance, passing in the requirements, content, content type, context info, and verbosity level.
5. **Assert the result:** Checks if the `enrich_content` method returns a valid result (not `None`).
6. **Log the result:** Logs the enriched content, its length, and the original content length for debugging purposes.
7. **Assert content size:** Asserts that the length of the result is at least 3 times the length of the original content.  This ensures the enrichment successfully increased the content size.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import pytest
    import textwrap
    import logging

    # ... (Import statements and necessary modules from the original code)

    content_to_enrich = textwrap.dedent(
    """
    # WonderCode & Microsoft Partnership: Integration of WonderWand with GitHub
    ## Executive Summary
    # ... (Rest of the original content)
    """).strip()

    requirements = textwrap.dedent(
    """
    Turn any draft or outline into an actual and long document, with many, many details. Include tables, lists, and other elements.
    The result **MUST** be at least 3 times larger than the original content in terms of characters - do whatever it takes to make it this long and detailed.
    """).strip()


    result = TinyEnricher().enrich_content(requirements=requirements,
                                       content=content_to_enrich,
                                       content_type="Document",
                                       context_info="WonderCode was approached by Microsoft to for a partnership.",
                                       context_cache=None, verbose=True)

    assert result is not None, "The result should not be None."
    # ... (Assertions for logging and content size)
