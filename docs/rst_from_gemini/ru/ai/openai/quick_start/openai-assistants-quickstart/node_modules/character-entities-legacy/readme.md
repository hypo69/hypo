**Role:** Document creator

This README file provides documentation for the `character-entities-legacy` package. It outlines its purpose, usage, API, installation, and other relevant information.


## Overview

This package lists legacy HTML named character references that don't require a trailing semicolon.  This is primarily for use cases involving legacy HTML parsing or manipulation.  It's generally recommended to use `parse-entities` or `stringify-entities` for most modern tasks.


## Key Features/Information

* **Legacy Character References:** Contains a list of named character references used in older HTML versions.
* **No Trailing Semicolon:**  Crucially, these references are the *legacy* kind that do not need a semicolon.
* **Emphasis on Legacy Usage:** The document highlights that this package is primarily intended for backward compatibility, not general use.
* **Alternatives:**  It strongly suggests considering `parse-entities` or `stringify-entities` for more modern and versatile handling of character references.
* **Clear Installation Instructions:** Provides instructions for installation via npm and Skypack for different environments (Node.js, Deno, and browsers).
* **Comprehensive API Documentation:**  Clearly explains the `characterEntitiesLegacy` export and its purpose.
* **Typescript Support:** States that the package is fully type-safe.
* **Compatibility and Security:**  Explicitly assures compatibility with modern Node.js versions and asserts the package's security.
* **Related Packages:** Lists related packages for working with character references, giving users context for alternative solutions and more comprehensive tools.
* **Contribution Information:** Provides a clear path for contributing to the project.


## Potential Improvements

* **Example Usage Enhancements:** While the provided examples are adequate, expanding them to cover a wider range of use cases (like demonstrating how to search/check) would improve understanding.
* **Use Cases Clarification:** More explicitly stating the scenarios where this package would be beneficial beyond the initial examples.  What specific tasks does it simplify?
* **Error Handling:** Mentioning potential errors or edge cases that might arise when using the package could improve user experience.
* **Performance Considerations:**  If known performance differences exist between this package and alternatives, briefly addressing this in the README would be helpful.


By addressing these points, the README could be even more helpful for users trying to understand and implement this legacy character entity handling package.
