How to use the OnelaBot module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python module (`onela_bot.py`) implements a Telegram bot (`OnelaBot`) for interacting with a programming assistant model.  It handles both text messages and uploaded documents, sending them to the model and forwarding the responses back to the user.  The bot uses the Google Gemini API for model interaction.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports libraries like `asyncio`, `telegram`, `pathlib`, and custom modules (`gs`, `OpenAIModel`, `GoogleGenerativeAI`, `TelegramBot`, `logger`) for Telegram bot functionality, file handling, and communication with the AI model.

2. **Define the `OnelaBot` class:** This class inherits from the `TelegramBot` class, providing the base structure for a Telegram bot.

3. **Initialize the model:**  The `__init__` method initializes a `GoogleGenerativeAI` model instance, specifying the API key from the `gs.credentials.gemini.onela` variable, and a configuration for text-based responses.

4. **Handle text messages:** The `handle_message` method processes incoming text messages from Telegram users. It retrieves the user's message, sends it to the initialized AI model (`self.model.chat(q)`), and replies with the model's response to the user.  It includes error handling for potential issues during communication.

5. **Handle uploaded documents:** The `handle_document` method processes uploaded documents. It downloads the document to a temporary file, then replies to the user with the document itself.  This method also includes comprehensive error handling for issues like missing or corrupted files.


6. **Run the bot:**  If the script is the main execution point (`if __name__ == '__main__':`), a `OnelaBot` instance is created and the bot starts listening for incoming messages and documents using `asyncio.run(bot.application.run_polling())`.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have the necessary setup)
    import asyncio
    from src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant import onela_bot as bot

    async def main():
        bot_instance = bot.OnelaBot()
        await bot_instance.application.run_polling()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

This example demonStartes how to instantiate and run the bot.  Remember to ensure that the required libraries and configuration (e.g., API keys) are correctly set up and imported within your project. Replace `src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant` with the actual path to the module.  Also, the `gs` module must be properly defined and load the relevant credentials.
