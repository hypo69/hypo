**Explanation of Improvements and Why:**

* **Docstrings:**  Added comprehensive docstrings to explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors of the function.  This is crucial for documentation and maintainability.
* **Error Handling:** The original code had a potential `ValueError` if "hypotez" wasn't found.  This is now handled gracefully with a `try...except` block and a more descriptive `FileNotFoundError` to signal the problem to the caller.  Checking if the calculated path actually exists is also added.
* **Clear Function Definition:** The code now has a clearly defined function `get_hypotez_root()` for better organization and reusability.
* **`__root__` Variable Removed:** The `__root__` variable was unnecessary and made the code less readable. The function now directly returns the path instead.
* **Example Usage (commented out):** The example usage has been included.  It is good practice to demonstrate how to use the function.  It is commented out to avoid accidental execution when importing the module.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hinting (`-> Path`) to the function, making the code's intent more explicit.
* **Robustness:** The code is more robust now, as it handles potential errors related to the location of "hypotez."

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save:** Save this code as `hypotez/src/utils/path_utils.py` (or a similar, appropriate location within your `hypotez` project).
2.  **Import:** Import the function into the modules that need it:

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.path_utils import get_hypotez_root

root_path = get_hypotez_root()
sys.path.append(str(root_path))  # Important: Convert Path to string
```

This revised code is cleaner, more readable, more maintainable, and robust to potential issues.  Crucially, it avoids global state, which is generally a good practice. Remember to adjust the import path (`hypotez.src.utils.path_utils`) to match your actual file structure. Using a helper module for path utilities will make your project more organized.
