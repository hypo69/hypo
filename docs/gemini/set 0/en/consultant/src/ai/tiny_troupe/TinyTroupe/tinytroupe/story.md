## Changes Made

- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` in `start_story` and `continue_story` to catch potential errors during LLM communication.
- Improved variable names and added detailed docstrings for functions, methods, and classes using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Converted comments to RST format for all functions, methods, and variables.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for file reading, as per the instruction.
- Added error handling to prevent potential exceptions.
- Replaced vague terms ("get," "do") with specific terms ("validation," "execution," "sending") in comments.
