**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `MockIopClient`, `MockIopRequest`, and `MockIopResponse` to simulate the `iop` module.  This is crucial for unit testing since it isolates the code under test from external dependencies (like file access).  Remember to replace the mocks with real interaction with `iop` if you have access to a real implementation.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover more aspects, including valid inputs, invalid file paths (simulated), and non-byte `file_bytes` input. This is crucial in detecting potential issues related to file handling or data types.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`.
* **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive, helping to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Error Handling:** The tests demonStarte appropriate handling of potential errors, catching exceptions and validating error messages.
* **Mocked File Content:** The `test_upload_valid_input` test now correctly creates a mock file content to avoid interacting with the file system during testing.

**To run these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the code above as `test_upload.py` in the same directory as your `iop` module (or wherever your `iop` code is).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_upload.py
    ```

Remember to replace the mock responses with proper validation based on the `iop` library's response structure.  This will ensure your tests are as realistic as possible to actual functionality.


This improved solution is robust, avoids potential errors, and demonStartes best practices for writing effective pytest tests. Remember to adjust the mocks and test cases based on the actual implementation of the `iop` module.
