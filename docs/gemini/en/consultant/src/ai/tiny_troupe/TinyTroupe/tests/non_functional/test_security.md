# Changes Made

*   Added type hints (`from typing import Any`).
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (and `j_loads_ns` if needed) for JSON handling.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` for consistent error logging.
*   Replaced vague comments with more precise descriptions.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format for the module and functions, following Sphinx style.
*   Improved error handling; instead of `try-except` blocks, now uses `logger.error` for logging errors during API interaction.  Added a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions.
*   Corrected `assert next_message_str.encode('utf-8')` to handle the case where the encoding might fail.  The `next_message_str.encode('utf-8')` would return `None` or raise an exception.
