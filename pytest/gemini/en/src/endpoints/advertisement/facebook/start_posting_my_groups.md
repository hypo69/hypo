**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock `Driver`, `Chrome`, and `logger`. This isolates the tests and prevents unexpected interactions with the real Facebook API or browser.  Crucially, the `mock_driver.get_url` now returns `None` to prevent actual browser interactions.

2. **Fixtures:**  Fixtures (`mock_driver`, `mock_chrome`, `mock_facebook_promoter`) are used to create mock objects. This makes the tests cleaner and more readable.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests cover valid input, empty `campaigns`, `KeyboardInterrupt` (handling the `try...except` block), and more importantly, `FileNotFoundError` (a crucial edge case) and `AttributeError` (for cases where the expected methods might be missing).

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Used correctly to assert that exceptions are raised as expected, improving exception handling testing.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more focused on testing the specific behavior or effect of the code under test (e.g., checking if `logger.info` was called with the expected message).

6. **Error Handling:** The tests now properly handle exceptions, verifying that the `try...except` block in the original code works as intended.  This is a substantial improvement over just assuming it would run without errors.

7. **Avoiding side effects:** The `get_url` method on the mock driver returns `None`.  This prevents tests from actually trying to navigate to a website.


This significantly improved test suite is far more robust and covers a wider range of potential issues. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already.  Run the tests with `pytest`. Remember to adapt this to the actual structure and requirements of your code.
