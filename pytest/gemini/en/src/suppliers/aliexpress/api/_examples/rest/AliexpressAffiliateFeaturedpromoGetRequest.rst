**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  The test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_getapiname_returns_correct_name`).

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover the `__init__` method and the crucial `getapiname` method, checking both initial values and custom values.

3. **Edge Case (Domain and Port):** Added a test to verify proper initialization with custom domain and port values.  This is an important edge case.

4. **Exception Handling (Illustrative):**  An example is included that demonstrates testing exception handling in the base `RestApi` class. The comment indicates that it is illustrative and needs to be adapted based on the actual methods present in the `RestApi` class.

5. **Robustness:**  Tests are structured to be more robust and maintainable.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Tests:**

* **`RestApi`:** The provided code only shows a small part of a potential class.  If there's a `RestApi` base class, you'll likely need to mock or stub out its methods (especially any potentially problematic network requests or API calls) to make your test cases work reliably without hitting external resources. This is where `mocker` (using `pytest-mock`) can become invaluable.  

* **Data-Driven Tests:** If the API class interacts with external data (e.g., fetching data from a database), consider using parameterized tests to run multiple scenarios.

* **Mocking:** Mock the behavior of any external dependencies (`RestApi` methods) to avoid making actual API calls in your tests.  This way, you can control the input data and expected output without relying on external factors.

* **Fixtures (Likely Needed):** If the class interacts with external services (database, file system, etc.), fixtures become crucial to setup those services in a controlled way within your test environment.


By addressing these points, you can create a more comprehensive and effective test suite for your `AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoGetRequest` class. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific implementation details of the class and its dependencies. Using a mocking library like `pytest-mock` is recommended for realistic test cases.
