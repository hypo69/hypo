.. module: src.utils 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

```

**Changes Made**

- Removed unused `Path` import and `MODE` variable.
- Added type hints for all parameters and return values.
- Replaced `try...except` blocks with specific exception handling for better error reporting and improved readability.
- Introduced explicit checks and error handling for file existence (`write` function)
- Removed unnecessary `source_file_path` parameter from `delete` function, as it's not used in the FTP deletion operation (and was redundant)
- Improved docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format to be more informative and in line with Sphinx documentation guidelines.  Explicitly mentioned exceptions that can be raised.
- Simplified error logging, using `logger.error` for clarity.
- Fixed the `read` function to properly close the FTP session and return the content in bytes format. The original code didn't close session, so it wasn't working correctly.
