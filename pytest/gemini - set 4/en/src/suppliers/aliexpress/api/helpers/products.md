**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`copy.deepcopy` and `copy.copy`:** The previous code was potentially modifying the input `product` objects. This is crucial to prevent side effects. The tests now use `copy.deepcopy` to create independent copies of the input data before passing it to the functions.  `copy.copy` is used to ensure the original data isn't mutated.

2. **Comprehensive `parse_product` tests:** Tests now cover different cases including edge cases (empty dictionary or no attribute).  Critically, these tests use `pytest.raises` to verify the expected `AttributeError` when dealing with missing attributes, improving robustness.

3. **Comprehensive `parse_products` tests:** Tests now cover an empty list input as well as a list containing a `None` value, which is an extremely common edge case.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Function names like `test_parse_product_valid_input` are more descriptive, improving readability.

5. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to all test functions to explain their purpose, making the tests easier to understand.


This revised solution addresses the potential issues and provides more robust test coverage for the given functions, meeting the requirements in the prompt. Remember to install pytest: `pip install pytest` before running the tests.
