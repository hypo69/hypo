## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/bangood/__init__.py

This module provides functions for interacting with the Banggood supplier website.  It's designed to fetch product data, likely for use in a hypothetical product cataloging or inventory management system.

**Key Concepts**

* **`MODE`:** This variable is currently set to 'dev'.  Its purpose is likely to control different operating modes (e.g., development, production) for the script.  Adjusting this variable might alter how the code interacts with the website.

* **`Graber`:**  This class, imported from `./graber.py`,  is likely the core functionality for interacting with the Banggood API or web scraping.  A specific `Graber` class is assumed to handle tasks like fetching product information from the website. This is crucial for controlling how data is extracted.  Detailed documentation for the `Graber` class should be consulted if needed.

* **`get_list_categories_from_site()`:** This function retrieves a list of categories from the Banggood website.  It is assumed to use the `Graber` class for the actual data retrieval.  

* **`get_list_products_in_category(category_name)`:** This function retrieves a list of products within a specified category.  The `category_name` argument is essential for filtering the results.


**How to Use**

1. **Import necessary functions:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.bangood import get_list_categories_from_site, get_list_products_in_category
```

2. **Fetch categories:**

```python
categories = get_list_categories_from_site()
print(categories)
```

   This will retrieve all categories available on Banggood.  Output will vary based on the structure of the website.

3. **Fetch products in a specific category:**

```python
category_name = "Electronics"  # Replace with the desired category name
products = get_list_products_in_category(category_name)
print(products)
```
   This example retrieves a list of products within the "Electronics" category.  The structure and content of the `products` list depend on the implemented data structure.

**Important Considerations**

* **Error Handling:** The provided code lacks error handling.  Robust production code should include `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during web requests or data parsing.
* **Rate Limiting:** Banggood's servers may impose rate limits.  Implement mechanisms in the `Graber` class to avoid exceeding these limits (e.g., introducing delays between requests).
* **Data Validation:** Carefully validate the structure and content of the data returned from the Banggood website to ensure its suitability for your application.
* **`./graber.py`:**  The `Graber` class (in `./graber.py`) is vital for data extraction.  Refer to its documentation for detailed usage information.


**Example of `Graber` Interaction (Illustrative):**


```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.bangood import Graber

graber = Graber()  # Instantiate the Graber class
try:
    categories = graber.get_categories()
    print(categories)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```


This example demonstrates the likely interaction with a `Graber` object to retrieve categories.  Remember to fill in the details specific to the `Graber` class from its implementation.
