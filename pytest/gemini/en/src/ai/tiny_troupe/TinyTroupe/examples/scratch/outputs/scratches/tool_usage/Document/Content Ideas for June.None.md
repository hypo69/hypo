**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Functions:** Since the provided code was just a description, I created placeholder functions (`get_content_idea_details`) to simulate the actual code.  This allows writing meaningful tests without depending on non-existent code.


2. **Comprehensive Tests:**  The tests now cover valid input for two different ideas, invalid input (idea number 3), and an edge case (input 0). This ensures thorough testing.


3. **Clear Assertions:** The `assert` statements clearly show the expected output compared to the actual output, making debugging easier.


4. **Descriptive Test Names:** Test names accurately describe the purpose of each test.


5. **Structure:** The code adheres to the requested `pytest` structure.

**How to run these tests:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_content_ideas.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_content_ideas.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution now provides a fully functional set of tests, demonstrating best practices in writing `pytest` tests.  Crucially, it handles cases where the input is not found, making it a more robust and realistic test suite. Remember to replace the dummy `get_content_idea_details` function with your actual code to use these tests effectively.
