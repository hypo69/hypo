Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.


Examples:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')

    >>> get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling (Crucial):**  The `save_video_from_url` function now has robust error handling. It catches `aiohttp.ClientError` specifically for HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found) and general exceptions. This is *much* more reliable.  It also checks for 0 content length and if the downloaded size matches the expected size.
* **Content-Length Check:** Added a crucial check for the `content-length` header.  If the header is missing or zero, it logs an error and returns `None`â€”preventing potential issues.
* **Progress Logging (Optional):**  Included a commented-out section to show how you could log download progress, which is beneficial for large files.
* **File Existence Check:** The `get_video_data` function now checks if the file exists before trying to open it.
* **Simplified `get_video_data`:** Improved the `get_video_data` function for clarity and efficiency.
* **Example Usage (Modified):**  The example now uses a valid image URL (important for testing).  It's much safer to test with a real (small!) file for debugging purposes.
* **Import `os` (helpful):** I added the `import os` line for potential use of the operating system (e.g., for creating directories).
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Improved error messages to provide more context.


**How to Run (Crucial):**

1.  **Install aiohttp and aiofiles:**
    ```bash
    pip install aiohttp aiofiles
    ```

2.  **Create a `src/logger.py`:**  If you don't have one already.  This handles logging.  A simple example:

```python
# src/logger.py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

3.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py 
    ```

This revised code is significantly more robust and handles potential problems that could lead to errors or silent failures.  Always test with actual URLs and files to validate the functionality. Remember to adjust the example usage to your specific needs.
