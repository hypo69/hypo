**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`gs_mock` Fixture:**  Crucially, this fixture mocks the `gs` module.  This is essential because the original code relies on a `gs` module (which is not provided) to find paths.  The mock allows you to control the return value of `gs.path.root` for testing purposes. This is a much more robust and testable solution than trying to create dummy files in a specific path.

* **`tmp_path` fixture (pytest):** This is used within `test_settings_loading_success` to create a temporary `settings.json` file, eliminating the need to worry about cleanup of files on every test run.

* **Clearer Error Handling:** The `test_settings_loading_failure_not_found` test now specifically checks for `FileNotFoundError`, which is the expected exception.

* **Comprehensive Testing of `set_project_root`:** Added tests for various scenarios: valid inputs, no marker files, marker file in parent directory, and the crucial edge case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`. This provides complete coverage for the `set_project_root` function.

* **`settings_file_path` fixture:** Creates the settings file in a temporary directory (`tmp_path`) and provides the path to this file. This keeps tests isolated and avoids relying on files outside the test environment.

* **Mocking `gs.path.root`:** This is essential for these tests to work. The mock allows you to control the return value of `gs.path.root` for testing purposes.

* **Removed Unnecessary Assertions:** Removed redundant assertions that were not providing relevant information about the test results.

* **Cleanup of Temporary Files:** Added `unlink()` calls to remove the created temporary files after each test to prevent accumulation of files in the test directory.

* **Realistic Testing (settings loading):**  The test cases now include a more realistic scenario by creating a settings.json file in a known location and then accessing it using the `gs_mock.path.root`

* **Realistic README File for `test_doc_str_loading_success`:** It now creates a temporary `README.MD` file in the correct location for testing purposes.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This improved solution provides a much more robust and effective way to test the code, ensuring that your tests are independent and cover important edge cases and error handling. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.suppliers.ebay.header` and any other relative imports with the actual path to the module if needed.  The `gs` module still needs to be mocked out if not already defined, and this example provides a correct way to do so using `monkeypatch`.
