How to use the `EventHandler` class for streaming OpenAI Assistant responses

This guide explains how to use the `EventHandler` class in the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/event_handler.py` file to handle and display the streamed responses from an OpenAI Assistant.

**1. Understanding the `EventHandler` class**

The `EventHandler` class, derived from `AssistantEventHandler`, defines how to react to different events in the OpenAI Assistant response stream.  It's designed to capture and display relevant information, allowing you to interact with the Assistant's progress in real-time.

Crucially, the `@override` decorator signifies that these methods override corresponding methods in the parent class.  This ensures proper event handling.

**2. Handling different event types**

* **`on_text_created`:**  Prints the entire text created by the assistant.
* **`on_text_delta`:** Prints incremental text changes (`delta.value`) to the existing text (`snapshot`).
* **`on_tool_call_created`:** Prints the type of tool call initiated by the assistant. Useful for tracking the execution stages.
* **`on_tool_call_delta`:**  This is the most complex method and the core of real-time response handling:
    * It checks for `code_interpreter` tool calls.
    * If an input is provided by the `code_interpreter`, it's printed.
    * If outputs are available from the `code_interpreter`, it prints "output >" followed by each output's logs, ensuring the logs are printed on new lines.

**3. Usage Example (Illustrative)**

```python
# Assuming you have an OpenAI API client (openai.OpenAI)
openai_client = OpenAI(...) # Replace with your initialization

# ... (your code to generate assistant response) ...
response = openai_client.create_thread(...)

event_handler = EventHandler()

response = openai_client.create_thread_run(
  thread_id=...,
  assistant_id=...,
  # ... (Other parameters) ...
  event_handler=event_handler
)

# The streamed response will now print events in real-time.

```

**4. Key Points**

* **Real-time output:** The `flush=True` in the `print` statements is crucial for seeing the output immediately.
* **Error Handling (Important):** Your actual code should include robust error handling.  The provided example lacks `try...except` blocks, which is essential for handling potential API errors or issues during streaming.
* **`snapshot` Parameter:**  The `on_text_delta` and `on_tool_call_delta` methods take a `snapshot` parameter. This provides a representation of the current state before the change, allowing you to build up the full response.

**5. Integrating with your workflow**

You'll integrate this `EventHandler` into your existing code to process and use the streamed data.  You might, for instance, use the output from the `code_interpreter` to further process or utilize in your application logic.  Be sure to handle potentially large output appropriately.

**6. Example Output (Illustrative):**

```
assistant > some initial text...
assistant > some additional text...
assistant > code_interpreter
code_interpreter_input: print("Hello")
output >
some log from interpreter output
```


This guide provides a practical understanding of how to use the `EventHandler` for handling streaming responses, focusing on code interpretation and output. Remember to adapt the usage to your specific application's needs and consider error handling to enhance robustness.
