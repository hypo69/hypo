# Module: hypotez/src/ai/dialogflow

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/ai/dialogflow`, likely provides functionality related to interacting with Dialogflow, a Google Cloud platform for conversational AI.  It appears to be initialized and configured.  The specifics of the module's behavior and methods are unclear without further details from the source code.  It's currently documented with placeholder comments that likely need elaboration for practical use.


## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A constant defining the operation mode, likely for development (`'dev'`) or production (`'prod'`) environments.

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Missing Documentation

The module's body contains numerous empty string docstrings.  Complete and descriptive docstrings for all components (classes, functions, variables) are necessary for proper documentation.  These placeholder strings should be replaced with detailed explanations of their purpose and operation. This should include parameters, return values and possible errors.  The provided example shows the desired format.  The section titled "HERE SHOULD BE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULE OPERATION !" clearly needs to be replaced with an accurate and comprehensive explanation.
