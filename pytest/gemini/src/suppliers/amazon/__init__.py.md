# Note: Since we don't have the implementation of Graber and get_list_products_in_category,
# we can't test their functionality here. We are just testing imports.
# Actual test of these classes and functions will be done in their own test files, e.g., test_graber.py and test_scenario.py
# This file mainly checks if the imports are working correctly and the MODE variable is set.
