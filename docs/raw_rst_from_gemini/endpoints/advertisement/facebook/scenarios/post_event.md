**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks around each function to catch and log exceptions properly. This is crucial for robustness.  Critically, it provides *specific* error messages and traces to help diagnose problems.

* **Clearer Function Names:** Renamed functions for better readability (e.g., `post_title`, `post_date`, etc.).

* **More Descriptive Docstrings:** Docstrings are now more informative, specifying the expected input types and return values precisely.  They explain what happens in case of failure.

* **Robust `post_event`:** The `post_event` function is now structured to handle potential failures in the individual posting steps. It returns `False` immediately if any sub-function fails. This prevents further processing if an earlier step has already encountered an issue.

* **Date/Time Extraction:**  The crucial change is how `post_date` and `post_time` are called.  The code now correctly extracts the date and time from the `event.start` string before passing them to the functions.  This is essential for parsing the data correctly.

* **Removed Unnecessary `input()`:**  The `input()` was removed as it was unnecessary and potentially blocking.


**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (Import necessary modules and initialize driver 'd' ) ...

# Example usage
event = SimpleNamespace(
    title="Campaign Title",
    start="2024-10-27 10:00",
    description="Event Description",
    promotional_link="https://example.com",
)

if post_event(d, event):
    print("Event posted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to post event.")

# ... (Close the driver 'd') ...
```

This revised code is significantly more reliable, readable, and robust for handling potential errors during Facebook event posting. Remember to replace placeholders like `locator.event_send` with the actual locator values from your `post_event.json` file. Remember to handle potential exceptions correctly! This example assumes `d` is a properly initialized `Driver` object.  Crucially, this now gives much better feedback about failures.
