**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Simplified Loop:** The code now efficiently uses a single loop and `break` to exit the loop as soon as the project root is found. This avoids unnecessary iterations and improves efficiency.  The previous approach checked all parents for all marker files.


2. **Correct Root Handling:** The logic now correctly finds the root directory. It finds the *first* parent directory containing a marker file and avoids potentially adding incorrect paths to `sys.path`.

3. **`sys.path` Optimization:** The crucial addition is the check `if str(project_root) not in sys.path:` before appending. This prevents redundant additions to `sys.path`, which is important for reliability and performance.


4. **Readability:**  Variable names (`project_root`) are more descriptive.  `__root__` is preserved in the final `return` statement.

5. **Efficiency:** The code is now more efficient as it avoids unnecessary checks within the nested loop.

**Why the previous code might have had issues:**

The original code, while understandable, could potentially insert the root directory into `sys.path` multiple times, leading to unexpected behavior.  The optimization ensures this doesn't happen.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

If `pyproject.toml` exists in the parent directory of `__init__.py`, the `get_project_root()` function would return the correct parent directory.  The `sys.path` modification ensures that Python modules from the root directory will be found when importing.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** While not shown here, you might want to add some error handling if there are cases where the project root cannot be determined. For example, if no marker file is found.
* **Marker File Choice:** Choosing appropriate marker files is important. `pyproject.toml` is a common choice in modern Python projects.


This revised solution is more robust, efficient, and avoids potential issues associated with repeatedly adding paths to `sys.path`.  It's a best practice to avoid unnecessary modifications to `sys.path`. This is critical for maintainability and avoiding unexpected behavior in your Python code. Remember to test your code thoroughly with different project structures to validate its behavior.
