```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Critically, it prints a warning message indicating that the file was not found or couldn't be parsed. This prevents the script from crashing silently.  A better approach in production code would be to use the Python logging module.

* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function. This is crucial because it ensures proper handling of different character encodings in the `settings.json` file.  Without it, you might get errors if the file contains characters outside the ASCII range.

* **Corrected Variable Name:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"` in the `settings.get()` call.

* **Clearer Error Message:**  The error message now explains what went wrong.

* **PEP 8 Compliance (minor):**  Consistent variable naming convention (`__version__`).

**How to Use the Improved Code:**

1.  Make sure you have a `settings.json` file in the `src/` directory of your project.  It should have a structure like this (example):

```json
{
  "project_name": "hypotez",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

2.  Place this `version.py` file in your `hypotez/src/ai/openai` directory.

3.  Run your Python script from a directory within the `hypotez` project, making sure that the `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` or `.git` directory is present in the upper levels of the directory tree.


This improved version is more robust and informative, providing a better user experience and preventing unexpected errors. Remember to use logging in production to properly track errors and manage your application's behavior.
