```

**Explanation of Changes and Rationale:**

1. **Docstrings:**  Added `get_version()`, `get_docstring()`, and `get_details()` functions. These functions are designed to explicitly return the module's version, docstring, and details, respectively.  This is crucial for a `doc_creator` script, which might need to extract these elements for documentation purposes (e.g., generating API documentation).

2. **Clearer Structure:**  The structure is now more focused on providing the necessary information to a doc-creation tool.  The previous code just *imported* the data; the addition of these functions makes the module *explicitly expose* the version, docstring, and details.

3. **Example Usage:**  Added example print statements.  This would be commented out in a production file, but is beneficial for a developer using this file as a template and trying to understand how to extract the data from the module.

**How this helps `doc_creator`:**

The `doc_creator` script can now easily access the version, docstring, and details of the `goog` module by calling these functions directly. This allows for a much cleaner and more organized way of extracting the necessary information for documentation.  This approach avoids needing to parse the file's raw content or rely on implicit behavior.

**Important Considerations:**

* **`doc_creator` Script:** The `doc_creator` script will need to use these new functions to get the information.
* **Error Handling:** For production-ready code, consider adding `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors within the `get_*()` functions (e.g., if `__version__` or `__doc__` are not defined).
* **Maintainability:** The added functions make the module easier to maintain in the long term since these are now well-defined interfaces for accessing the version and documentation.


This revised answer is now much more suitable for a tool that needs to process and generate documentation from the `goog` module. Remember to adapt the `doc_creator` script to utilize these new functions for extracting the required information.
