# hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/test_extention/html/popup.html

## Overview

This HTML file (`popup.html`) serves as the popup UI for a browser extension. It displays a simple message to the user, instructing them on how to interact with the extension.

## HTML Structure

The file contains basic HTML5 elements, including a `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<style>` tag, and `<title>` tag.

## CSS Styling

The embedded `<style>` tag defines basic styling for the popup, setting a width and padding for the body.

## Functionality

The HTML file does not contain any JavaScript or interactive elements. Its sole function is to present a user-friendly message explaining the extension's purpose and how to use it. This is achieved through a simple header and paragraph.

## Code Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>hypotez</title>
    <style>
        body {
            width: 200px;
            padding: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>hypotez</h1>
    <p>Click the extension icon to collect data from the current webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
