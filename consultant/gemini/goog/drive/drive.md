**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Fixes:**

* **`gs.path.secrets`:** The code now explicitly requires a correct `gs.path.secrets` definition in your `__init__.py` file.  This is essential; the previous code assumed this path was accessible.
* **`SCOPES` as Class Attribute:**  The `SCOPES` variable is now a class attribute, which is the proper way to make it accessible inside the `__init__` method.
* **Service Object:** The `service` object is now created *inside* the `__init__` method, using the authenticated credentials. This prevents unnecessary re-authentication.
* **`MediaFileUpload`:** The code now uses `MediaFileUpload` correctly.  This is absolutely vital for uploading files; the previous attempts were incorrect.  It also includes `mimetype` for better handling.
* **Error Handling (Crucial):** Added `try...except` blocks to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` if the folder doesn't exist, and a general `Exception` block for other issues.  This prevents crashes.
* **`_get_folder_id` Function:**  Added a function to reliably find the folder ID based on the name. This is more robust than just assuming the folder exists. Importantly, it now handles the case where the folder isn't found, raising a `FileNotFoundError`.
* **Explicit Folder Name:** The example now requires you to provide the actual folder name.
* **Logging:** The `logger` from your `src.logger` module is now used to log success, but it's commented out because you haven't provided a definition. Consider activating your logging in this instance

**How to Use:**

1. **Correct `__init__.py`:** Ensure `gs.path.secrets` is correctly defined in your `__init__.py` file.
2. **Install necessary libraries:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

3. **Replace placeholders:**
   - Update `folder_name` and `file_path` in the `main` function with the actual folder name and file path you want to use.
   -  Make sure the `sample_file.txt` is available at the specified `file_path`.

4. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.  It will authenticate you with Google Drive and upload the file.


This improved version is significantly more robust and handles potential errors, ensuring that your script is reliable. Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual folder name and file path.  Crucially, correct path references to your secret file (`gs.path.secrets`) are also necessary.
