```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, explaining the purpose of each test (e.g., `test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**  Tests now include cases where `hypotez` might not be found in the path (`test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`) and empty paths (`test_root_path_calculation_empty_path`). This is crucial for robustness.

3. **Mocking `sys.path` and `os.getcwd`:**  The `test_append_to_path` now correctly mocks `sys.path` and `os.getcwd`. This is essential for preventing unintended side effects on the global state during testing.

4. **Error Handling:** The `test_append_to_path` includes a `try...except` block to catch and report any errors that might occur during the `append` operation within the tested code.

5. **Clean-up:** The example test cases now properly change the working directory back to its original state after testing to prevent issues in subsequent tests. This is *crucial* when running tests in a loop or dealing with files or directories.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `"hypotez"` with the actual name of your top-level directory if different.
- **Real Project Structure:** The tests now use a better placeholder for the `test_path`, which is a better abstraction than hardcoding a string.  You'll need to adjust the path to reflect the actual structure of your project.

- **Further Testing:** Add tests for other aspects of the code (e.g., checking the actual functionality of the `MODE` variable if it's used elsewhere).


This improved solution provides a more robust and maintainable set of tests for the given Python code. Remember to adapt these tests to match the specific functionalities and requirements of your code. Remember to run `pytest` from the directory containing the test file to execute the tests.
