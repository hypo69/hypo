# hypotez/src/gui/openai_trаigner/payload.py

## Overview

This module, `src.gui.openai_trаigner`, likely contains configuration or data payload definitions for interacting with OpenAI.  The specific purpose is unclear due to the lack of meaningful comments within the provided Python code.  The current code only defines a constant `MODE` and contains several empty string documentation blocks.

## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description:** A string variable likely representing the current mode of operation (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

**Value:** 'dev'


## Usage

The documentation provided is insufficient to describe how this module should be used.  The lack of substantial code makes it impossible to provide examples.


**Important Notes:**

The provided Python code lacks sufficient comments to understand the intended behavior and purpose of this module.  This documentation is highly generalized as a result.  More comprehensive comments in the source code are needed to generate accurate and useful documentation.
