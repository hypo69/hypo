```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing `import` statements for `j_loads` and `logger` from appropriate modules.
- Replaced `json.loads` with `j_loads` for reading JSON files.
- Added `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors during spreadsheet operations and logged errors using `logger.error`.
- Improved error handling. Now returns an empty dictionary or None when appropriate, instead of throwing exceptions.
- Added RST-style docstrings to functions and classes, adhering to Sphinx conventions.
- Added comments to functions explaining what they do.
- Corrected a potential issue with redundant assignment of spreadsheet instance.
- Improved formatting and readability of the code.
- Use `logger` from the `src.logger` module consistently.
- Added information about already existing spreadsheets.
- Fixed errors in the `get_by_title` method; the previous implementation was incomplete.
