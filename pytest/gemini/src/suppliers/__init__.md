**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:**  The code now includes placeholder imports (`from hypotez.src.suppliers import MODE`).  **Crucially**, you *must* import any classes or functions from the `hypotez.src.suppliers` module that you're testing. This is essential for `pytest` to recognize them.

2. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided example tests are now *placeholder* tests.  You need to replace the comments with the actual function calls, class instantiations, and assertions that correspond to the functions and classes in your `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py` file.

3. **Error Handling:** The example `test_invalid_supplier_prefix` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions. Replace the example with the correct error handling checks from your `Supplier` class or relevant functions.

4. **Valid Input Test:** The example `test_mode_is_defined` checks if `MODE` is properly defined and what its type should be.  This is a very basic but important test.

5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The example `test_get_product_details_empty_prefix` shows how to test edge cases (like an empty supplier prefix).  Look for potential problems and situations, like empty strings, or very small/large numbers.

6. **Specific Assertions:** Each test should include specific assertions to verify that the function is returning the correct data type, value, or raising the expected exception.

7. **Fixture:** The example `example_supplier_data` fixture demonstrates a useful pattern for supplying data to your tests. This is crucial when your tests depend on specific data.

**Before Running the Tests:**

* **Make sure your `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py` file is correctly structured.**
* **Import the correct classes and functions** from your file in the test file.
* **Replace all placeholder comments** with your actual test logic.

**How to run tests:**

From the directory containing your `hypotez` folder:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all the test functions within your test file.  If you encounter errors or issues, the output of `pytest` will tell you precisely what went wrong and where to modify your tests or code. Remember to adapt the tests to the actual code in the `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py` file.
