**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The crucial `logger` and `settings` are mocked using `unittest.mock.Mock`. This isolates the tests from external dependencies and prevents actual interactions with the file system or logging system. This is much safer for testing than relying on real paths and external programs.
* **Specific Exception Handling:** The `test_edge_constructor_invalid_edgedriver` test specifically checks for `WebDriverException`. This makes the test more focused and reliable.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names like `test_edge_constructor_valid_input` are more descriptive and easier to understand.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The test now uses `pytest.raises` to verify that the expected exception (`WebDriverException`) is raised when the Edge driver fails to start, significantly improving the test's coverage. The catch-all `except Exception as ex` in the original code is often problematic. Specific exception handling is important for reliable and maintainable tests.

* **Important:** Replace `"path/to/edgedriver"` with the actual path to your Edge WebDriver executable.  You MUST have a valid path to the edge driver on your system or a valid mock path.
* **`edge.json` Mock:**  You'll need to mock the contents of your `edge.json` file in the `mock_settings` object to avoid problems with file reading. The `j_loads_ns` is not needed for the Edge class tests (but it does need mocking).

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_edge.py`).
2.  Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_edge.py`

This improved solution provides a much more robust and reliable way to test the `Edge` class, ensuring your tests are isolated, handle potential errors correctly, and cover various scenarios. Remember to replace placeholders like `"path/to/edgedriver"` with accurate values for your environment. Remember to import necessary modules from your project.
