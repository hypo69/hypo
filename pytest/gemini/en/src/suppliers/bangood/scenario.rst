**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `MockDriver` and `MockSupplier` to mock the `driver` and `locators` objects. This isolates the tests from external dependencies like webdrivers.  Critically, it allows for predictable test data instead of relying on an external website.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Tests now cover valid input (list of URLs), an empty list returned from the locator, a single string returned from the locator, and a missing locator.

4. **Error/Warning Handling:** Tests now check for expected error and warning messages logged by the function. This is crucial for ensuring the function correctly handles various edge cases.

5. **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):** `pytest.raises` isn't needed for these specific tests because we are checking for the expected return value or error/warning messages logged by the code itself.

6. **`caplog` fixture:** The `caplog` fixture is used to capture logs during the test execution, which is important for testing the logging aspects of your code.

7. **Stub for `get_list_categories_from_site`:** Added a stub test for `get_list_categories_from_site`.  Crucially, **you must replace the placeholder assertion (`assert result is None`)** with assertions based on the actual behavior of `get_list_categories_from_site`.  This stub test is a starting point; add real assertions once you understand how this function works.

**Before running these tests:**

* **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
* **Replace Placeholders:** If the mocks or the `supplier` class aren't correctly structured based on your actual code, adjust the mocks to match the classes and their attributes.
* **Add missing imports:** If the test code doesn't import everything needed, ensure you import those items correctly.
* **Implement `get_list_categories_from_site` Tests:**  Make the stub test for `get_list_categories_from_site` reflect the actual behavior.

Remember to adapt the test cases based on the actual implementation of `get_list_categories_from_site`, the `supplier` class and any other external dependencies of the functions being tested. Always test edge cases and unexpected situations.
