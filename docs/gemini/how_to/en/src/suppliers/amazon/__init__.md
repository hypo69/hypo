## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/__init__.py`, serves as the entry point for interacting with Amazon product data within the `hypotez` project.  It imports necessary classes and functions from submodules (`graber` and `scenario`).

**Key elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely defines the operating mode, presumably 'dev' for development.  The significance of this setting depends on the implementation; it could control logging levels, data sources, or other behaviors.

* **`from .graber import Graber`:** Imports the `Graber` class.  This class likely handles fetching data from Amazon.  To use it, you'll need to instantiate a `Graber` object.

* **`from .scenario import get_list_products_in_category`:** Imports the `get_list_products_in_category` function. This function likely retrieves a list of products belonging to a specified category.  It's designed for specific use cases around Amazon data.


**How to Use:**

1. **Import necessary functions/classes:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.amazon import Graber, get_list_products_in_category
```

2. **Instantiate `Graber` (if needed):**

```python
amazon_data_fetcher = Graber()
```

3. **Use `get_list_products_in_category`:**

```python
category_name = "Electronics > Laptops"
product_list = get_list_products_in_category(category_name)

if product_list:
    for product in product_list:
        print(product) #Example: print relevant product details
else:
    print("No products found in the specified category.")
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The provided code lacks error handling. You should add `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions (e.g., network issues, invalid category names, API errors). This is crucial for robust code.  For instance, add `try...except` around the function call to `get_list_products_in_category` to catch and handle potential errors.

* **`Graber` Class Details:** The `Graber` class likely has methods for handling specific Amazon API calls. You should refer to the documentation for that class in `.graber.py` or associated documentation for the specific parameters and behaviors expected (e.g., authentication, pagination, and data parsing).

* **Dependencies:** This code likely depends on libraries like the Amazon product API and any required packages. Ensure those dependencies are installed.


**Example Implementation improvements:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.amazon import Graber, get_list_products_in_category
import logging

def get_products_by_category(category_name, max_results=10):
    try:
        amazon_data_fetcher = Graber()
        product_list = get_list_products_in_category(category_name, max_results)
        if product_list:
            for product in product_list:
                print(product) #Print or process product data
            return True #or the relevant data
        else:
            logging.warning(f"No products found for category: {category_name}")
            return False  # Indicate no results
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching products: {e}")
        return False


if __name__ == "__main__":
    category = "Electronics > Headphones"
    success = get_products_by_category(category)
    if success:
        print("Product retrieval successful.")
```

This improved example adds error handling, logging for easier debugging, and a clear return value to indicate success or failure of the operation.  Remember to adapt this example based on the specific behavior and expected results from `get_list_products_in_category`.
