```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `Session.request` method.  This is crucial for testing without relying on an external API.  The `mock_response` fixture provides a way to control the responses.  Critically, it now mocks the `Session` class itself rather than relying on monkey-patching the `PreparedRequest` which is not robust.

2. **Error Handling:** Added `test_ping_failed` to test the error handling path.  This demonstrates the crucial `_check_response` method being called.

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The example `test_create_successful` is added and provides the basic pattern for other tests.  You'll need to add similar tests for `read`, `write`, `unlink`, `search`, `create_binary`, `upload_image`, and more.

4. **Valid/Invalid Input Tests:** The tests should cover different scenarios.  You need tests to ensure:
   - `create` with valid data and correct return value.
   - `create` with invalid data (e.g., wrong data type) to check exception handling.
   - `search` with correct and incorrect filter values.
   - Calls to `upload_image` with valid image URLs and invalid ones.


5. **Edge Cases:** For example,  consider edge cases like a `product_id` of 0 for `get_product_images`.

6. **Exception Handling with `pytest.raises`:** Use `pytest.raises` to explicitly test for `PrestaShopException` and `PrestaShopAuthenticationError` within the appropriate test methods.

7. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names are descriptive.

8. **`mock_credentials`:**  This fixture isolates your tests from the `gs.credentials` module, making them more reliable.


**How to run the tests:**

Make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Then, in your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `test_api.py` file (and the `hypotez` directory) and run:

```bash
pytest test_api.py
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **External Dependencies:**  The tests now mock `gs.credentials`, so you won't need the actual `gs` library. If you use other external libraries, you may need to mock those too.
* **File Handling:** The code has file-saving operations.  You'll need to mock or avoid those in your tests. For `create_binary`, consider mocking the file creation step or handling the temporary files properly in your tests if needed.
* **HTTP Exceptions:** The original code handles `ExpatError` and `ValueError`. The test suite should include tests with expected `requests` exceptions.
* **Complex Logic:**  If the PrestaShop API has complex interactions, you might need to mock more of the underlying logic to test specific points.
* **Complete Tests:**  A robust set of tests needs substantial detail for comprehensive coverage.
