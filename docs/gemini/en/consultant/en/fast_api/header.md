**Received Code**



**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

- Added missing `from src.logger import logger` import.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except` blocks for file reading.
- Corrected the spelling of `copyright` in `__copyright__` variable.
- Improved and standardized docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format for all functions, variables, and modules.
- Removed unnecessary import of `gs` module and the `__root__` variable from the `get_project_root` function.  It's now better passed from the calling module.
- Ensured the use of single quotes in the Python code.
- Changed `settings_file` to a more descriptive `root_path` within the `get_project_root` function.
- Added missing `:type` and `:raises` tags to docstrings for type hinting and error handling.
