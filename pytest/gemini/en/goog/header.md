**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs`:**  The most significant improvement is mocking the `gs` module.  Testing code that interacts with external resources (files, databases, etc.)  is much harder and unreliable.  You can't guarantee the presence or content of those files, which will lead to flaky tests.  The `MockGs` class now provides a dummy `gs` module that returns the necessary `Path` objects.  This lets you control the inputs and ensures tests run consistently.

2. **Mocking Files:**  The tests now create mock files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`,  `settings.json`, `README.MD`)  in the appropriate locations *within the test*.  This enables testing the code logic without needing external files.

3. **Robust Exception Handling:** The tests for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD` now use `pytest.raises` to test the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` cases, verifying that the `try...except` blocks are working correctly. This is crucial for handling real-world scenarios where the files might be missing or corrupted.

4. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive and explain the scenario being tested.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The examples cover basic valid input, various cases related to file location, and handling errors.  You should expand these examples to cover all cases and edge conditions in the actual code (e.g., different marker file combinations).

6. **`sys.path` handling in `get_project_root`:**  The tests account for cases where the root directory is already in `sys.path`. This is a very important edge case to test.


Remember to replace the `mock_gs` with a real `gs` module if you have a proper `src.gs` module.


This revised approach provides much more robust and reliable tests.  Run `pytest` in the directory containing this test file. Remember to adapt the paths used in the tests if your project structure is different.  Also, ensure the `src` and `settings.json`, and other relevant files exist in the appropriate structure.
