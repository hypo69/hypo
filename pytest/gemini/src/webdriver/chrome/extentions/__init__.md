**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`test_version_correctness`:**  Crucially, this test now includes a placeholder (`expected_version`). You need to replace `'1.0.0'` with the actual version number that your `__version__` variable is *supposed* to hold.  This is essential because if your versioning logic isn't correct, these tests will fail (which is what you want).  Without a known good version, there's no way to reliably test for the correctness of your versioning logic.

* **`test_docstring_presence` and `test_docstring_type`:**  These tests are added to verify that the `__doc__` and `__details__` variables are present and have the correct type (string).  These checks are vital for documentation; if these are empty or of an incorrect type, your documentation is broken.

* **Example of Exception Handling:** The example exception test is commented out because no exception handling was present in the provided code.  If your code *did* include exception handling, this part would be crucial.

* **`mocker` patching (example):** The commented-out `test_dynamic_version` demonStartes how you'd mock a dynamically-created `__version__` in a testing environment if your versioning depended on external data.

* **Clarity and Specificity:** Test names (`test_version_type`, `test_version_string`, etc.) are now clearer and more descriptive of the specific aspect of the code being tested.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Save:** Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_extentions.py`).
2.  **Run:** Run `pytest test_extentions.py` from your terminal.  Pytest will discover and execute the tests.

**Important:**

- **Replace placeholders:**  Substitute the placeholder version number in `test_version_correctness` with the actual expected value of your `__version__` variable.  Without a known good `__version__` value, this test, and indeed this part of the whole test suite, is useless.
- **Extend tests:** Add more tests for other functions or attributes in the `hypotez.src.webdriver.chrome.extentions` module if needed.
- **Adapt to your code:** Adjust the test cases to precisely match the functionality of your code.  If your code has complex logic or exceptions, you need to write tests that cover all those cases.
