**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `service_account` function and the `openall`, `create`, and `open_by_key` methods. This isolates the tests from the external Google Sheets API, preventing real API calls and avoiding issues with needing credentials or the existence of test spreadsheets.  This significantly improves testability.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_get_by_title_raises_exception` demonStartes how to test exception handling.  It's a best practice to anticipate potential issues (e.g., file not found, API errors) and test their handling.
* **Fixture for Instance:** The `spreadsheet_instance` fixture is now more robust, providing an initialized `GSpreadsheet` object for all test methods. This ensures that test methods have a consistent starting state.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more specific (e.g., checking for `isinstance` of the expected types).
* **Realistic Test Data:** The `spreadsheets.json` is a placeholder, you'll need to create a dummy `spreadsheets.json` file with some valid JSON data if the `get_project_spreadsheets_dict` function expects that file to be present. This now accurately represents the intended use of the function.
* **Realistic Mock Spreadsheet:** The `test_get_by_title_existing_spreadsheet` creates a mock spreadsheet to avoid creating/sharing a real one in your test environment.
* **Comprehensive Tests:**  The test suite now covers a wider range of cases, including edge cases and exception handling.

**Before running these tests:**

1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest gspread
    ```

2.  **Create a dummy `spreadsheets.json`:** Create a small dummy JSON file named `spreadsheets.json` in the same directory as your tests.  For example:
```json
{
  "spreadsheets": []
}
```

3.  **Ensure `global_settingspread.py` is accessible:**  The test assumes the `global_settingspread` module exists and that its classes are defined correctly, including the `service_account` function.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and reliable test suite for your code. Remember to adapt the test cases and assertions based on the specific requirements and structure of the methods you are testing and the expected behavior of the Google Sheets API.
