**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the input condition (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

2. **Isolated Tests:**  Each test function now creates a temporary directory and files for testing, ensuring no interference between tests.  Crucially, the temporary directory is cleaned up.

3. **Exception Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_invalid_input` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected `TypeError` when an invalid `marker_files` type is passed.

4. **Edge Cases:** Added `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` to handle the case where no marker files are found, and `test_set_project_root_marker_files_not_found` for when files in marker list don't exist.

5. **Mocking:**  The previous example was not actually testing the function, but rather the handling of files in the system, which is very hard to do thoroughly without external dependencies. It is better to provide dummy files for the specific case being tested.

6. **Correct use of `sys.path`:**  The `test_set_project_root_root_in_sys_path` test verifies that the root directory is added to `sys.path` only if it is not already there.

7. **Import Statements:** The test code imports the `gs` module, which will resolve the correct path if `hypotez.src` is located in the same directory.

8. **Testing Settings:** The tests now include specific tests (`test_settings_loading` and `test_settings_loading_file_not_found`) to cover the cases of a successful and failed `settings.json` loading, removing the problematic use of `gs` as an implicit fixture.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution is significantly more robust and comprehensive in testing the `set_project_root` function, and the handling of the `settings.json` file. Remember to adapt the paths in the tests if your project structure changes.


Important Note:  The use of `gs` in the original code needs clarification. This solution assumes `gs` is a module in the same project structure and provides `gs.path.root` for path resolution. You might need to adapt the test suite further if `gs` is a different class or module.
