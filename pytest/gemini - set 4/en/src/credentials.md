**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `PyKeePass`:** The crucial part is mocking the `PyKeePass` class. This is necessary because `PyKeePass` interacts with a real KeePass database, which is not suitable for unit tests.  The mock simulates the expected behavior of `find_groups` and `entries` methods, allowing us to test the credential loading logic in isolation.

2. **Mock Data:** The example mocks are placeholder; you will need to refine them to match the structure and content of your actual KeePass database entries. The mock now properly returns mock data objects that contain `custom_properties` and `password` attributes to mimic your data structures.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The provided tests now include basic cases for `set_project_root` (valid path, no marker files). They also cover the initialization of `ProgramSettings` with and without a config file and loading credentials from different sources.

4. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test names are more informative.

5. **pytest Fixtures:** Use `pytest.fixture` for `mock_kp` to set up the necessary mocking environment.

6. **Error Handling:** Tests that involved file reading (like `test_program_settings_init`) are now robust.

7. **Example `MockPyKeePassEntry` and `MockPyKeePassGroup` Classes:** Added placeholder classes for the mock database entries, showing the structure that can be used for testing. This now allows test code to interact with the mock database structure and properly test credential loading.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Place the test code in a file named `test_credentials.py` (or whatever name you choose) in the same directory as your `credentials.py` file.
3. Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_credentials.py`.


**Crucially, you need to adapt the mock data structures (and any necessary `pytest` fixtures) to match the specific structure and expected data from your `credentials.py` file.**  This ensures that the tests are truly comprehensive for your code. Add more tests to cover edge cases, invalid inputs, and any exception handling paths. The provided mock data only covers the simplest possible case.
