**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Fixture:** The code now includes a `driver_fixture` that creates and manages a Selenium WebDriver instance.  Crucially, it quits the driver after the test, ensuring resources are released.  This is **essential** for avoiding conflicts and test failures.  Replace `webdriver.Chrome()` with the appropriate WebDriver constructor for your browser.

2. **Locators Fixture:** A `locators` fixture is introduced to provide mock locator data.  This is a much better approach than hardcoding locators directly into tests.  Replace the placeholder selectors with your actual locators.

3. **Mocking:** The most important change is the use of `unittest.mock.patch`. This lets you control parts of the `login` function and test its behavior under various conditions. This is crucial for testing without relying on external factors (like a real web browser).

4. **Exception Handling:** The example `test_login_exception` demonstrates how to test for `AttributeError` using `pytest.raises`.

5. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the purpose of each test.

6. **Resource Management:** The `driver_fixture` ensures that the WebDriver is properly cleaned up after each test.

7. **Error Handling:** The tests now check that appropriate errors are raised when there are issues.

8. **Mock Logger:** Mocking the `logger` is essential for avoiding unintended side effects and for verifying that the logger is used correctly.


**How to Use:**

1. **Install pytest and Selenium:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-selenium selenium
   ```

2. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder selectors (`'open_login_input_selector'`, etc.) with the actual selectors from your HTML.  Ensure the selectors are correct for your specific web page structure.

3. **Run Tests:** Run the tests using `pytest`.

**Critical Considerations:**

* **Real Browser:** The tests still need significant improvement to simulate using a real browser. The mocks are a step toward this but a real browser will be required for robust testing.

* **Robust Locator Strategy:**  Using `driver.find_element` and robust strategies to locate elements in the actual browser is crucial for avoiding unreliable tests that may fail unexpectedly.  The mocks and testing strategy here assume selectors can be validated, and if not the tests may not catch potential issues.  Robust and well-maintained locators in the `locators` fixture are paramount.

* **Data-Driven Tests:**  Consider how to create data-driven tests where different login credentials are used to cover various scenarios.

* **More Comprehensive Tests:**  You need significantly more tests to thoroughly cover different cases.  Add tests for various scenarios like:
   - Missing inputs.
   - Incorrect inputs.
   - Interactions with other elements during the login process.
   - Handling different login page structures.
