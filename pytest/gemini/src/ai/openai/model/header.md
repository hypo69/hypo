```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures to create temporary files for testing without modifying the actual project files.  Crucially, the fixtures delete these files after the test, avoiding potential conflicts.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more clearly describe the test case, making them more maintainable.

* **Error Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  These are critical for robustness.

* **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where the marker file is not found, or when `settings.json` doesn't exist or contains malformed JSON.

* **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Uses `pytest.tmp_path` to create temporary directories for testing.  This is good practice as it ensures tests don't interact with each other or existing files.

* **`set_project_root` Testing:** Tests are designed to cover various scenarios for `set_project_root`, including cases where the marker files are in the parent directory, no marker files are found, and multiple marker files.

* **Comprehensive Testing:** The code now includes a much broader range of tests to cover the key aspects of the code, ensuring that it behaves correctly in various situations.

* **Import Fix:** The `hypotez` import was fixed, making this code compatible with a hypothetical project structure.

* **Robustness:** Added `missing_ok` argument in the `unlink` method to handle the case where the file might not exist in some situations.

**How to use these tests:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.

Remember to adapt the test fixtures and the `tmp_path` usage if your project structure is different.  The key is to create temporary files to avoid side effects and unexpected behavior in the tests. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual paths/data if they are different. Also, adjust test expectations based on the expected behaviour of the file loading, for example, in cases of failure to load settings.json.
