Changes Made
```
- Added imports `from src.logger import logger` and `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.
- Added RST-style docstrings to `base64_to_tmpfile` and `base64encode`.
- Improved error handling using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error` for better logging of potential errors. This includes error checking for invalid Base64 input and file not found.
- Added type hints to `base64_to_tmpfile` and `base64encode`.
- Corrected the error handling for potential issues when creating temporary files.
- Renamed `base64encode` to match the style in other functions.
