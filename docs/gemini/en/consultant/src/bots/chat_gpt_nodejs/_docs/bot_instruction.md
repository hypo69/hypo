# Changes Made

*   Added missing imports (`from src.logger import logger`).
*   Added RST-style docstrings to all functions.
*   Replaced vague terms with specific ones in docstrings (e.g., "get" to "retrieving").
*   Used `logger.error` for error handling.
*   Improved code structure and readability by adding comments.
*   Included detailed error handling within try-except blocks.
