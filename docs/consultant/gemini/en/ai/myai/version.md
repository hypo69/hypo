**Changes Made**

- Added missing `import sys`.
- Added RST-style docstrings to the module.
- Added missing `"""` for the docstrings in `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__copyright__`
- Removed shebangs `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python`, as they are generally not needed in Python modules and are often handled by environment variables.
- Replaced incorrect `__version__` assignment with `__version__ = 'v1.1'` for consistency.
