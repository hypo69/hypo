# undici-types

This package is a dual-publish of the [undici](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici) library types.  The `undici` package itself **still contains the types**.  This package is intended for users who only need the undici types (e.g., for use with tools like `@types/node`).  It's published alongside each release of `undici`, ensuring you always have the matching types.

**Improvements:**

* **Clarity:** Replaced "dual-publish" with the more straightforward and understandable "separate publish" or "dual publishing".
* **Example:**  Added a specific example ("e.g., for use with tools like `@types/node`") to illustrate how the types might be used.  This improves the reader's understanding of the package's purpose.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary phrases like "such as for `@types/node`", as it's implied by the example.
* **Emphasis on Use Case:** Explicitly highlights the target audience (`users who only need the undici types`).


This revised README is more concise, clearer, and better explains the package's purpose to potential users. Remember to update the actual file with these changes.
