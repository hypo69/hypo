#     assert "some specific error message" in str(excinfo.value)

#If a method called 'stop' exists

# def test_chrome_stop():
#   """Tests if the Chrome browser stops correctly"""
#   chrome = Chrome()
#   chrome.start()
#   chrome.stop()
#   assert chrome.is_running is False

# IMPORTANT: Replace the example comments above with actual tests based on the
#  implementation details of the `Chrome` class and its methods.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Correctly:** The code now correctly imports the `Chrome` class from the specified file.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and indicate the test's purpose (e.g., `test_chrome_creation`, `test_chrome_creation_with_args`).

3. **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for `TypeError` and other potential exceptions during instantiation and method calls.

4. **Fixture Handling (if needed):**  A placeholder for fixtures is included, though in this simplified example, they aren't strictly needed.  If your `Chrome` class requires input data, a fixture would be necessary.

5. **More Robust Example:**  Added tests cases that explore different scenarios.  (e.g., creating a `Chrome` object with an argument).   Note these example tests are placeholders, you must add tests for any actual methods the `Chrome` class has.


**How to use:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_chrome.py`).
2.  Run the tests from the command line using `pytest test_chrome.py`.

**Crucial Next Steps (adapt to your actual `Chrome` class):**

*   **Replace the placeholder comments:**  Fill in the example tests with actual tests based on the methods and functionality provided by your `Chrome` class.
*   **Add tests for all methods:**  Test `start`, `stop`, or any other methods provided by the `Chrome` class.
*   **Consider inputs/arguments:** Test valid, invalid, and boundary conditions for the methods.
*   **Focus on important logic:**  Focus on edge cases, error handling, and the core functionality of each method.
*   **Use appropriate assertions:**  Instead of just checking `isinstance`, use more specific assertions based on the expected behavior.
