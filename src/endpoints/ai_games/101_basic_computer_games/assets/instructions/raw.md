the last. However, in many ways it is unique. It is the first collection of games all in BASIC, It is also the only collection that contains both a complete listing and a sample run of each game along with a descriptive write-up. Educational Value of Games Educators have widely different opinions as to the educational value of games. There tends to be agreement that games are highly motivational and frequently very addictive. Most educators agree that games generally foster learning by dis covery--i.e., the player .doesn't sit down at the terminal with the purpose of learning a principle of logic but after playing BAGLES three or four times he most assuredly has learned some thing about logic. Newton's second law is probably the furthest thing from the mind of a person sitting down to Play ROCKET. However, when the player finally lands his LEM successfully on the moon, the chances are very good that he has discovered something about gravity varying inversely with the mass of the LEM and the distance from the moon. The main objection to games as a learning tool seems to be the fact that it's largely unguided learning and potentially waste ful of computer time. Art Leuhrmann of Dartmouth joked that some computer center directors might be willing to pay to not have the book sold on campus because of the computer time that would be burned up by playing the games; however, the educational value of games can be enormous - not only in their playing but in their creation. The majority of games submitted tend to simulate a sport, card or board game, a game of chance or something which already exists. only a few games begin to use the logical and computational capabilities of the computer to come up with something new and truly un ique • LIFE-2. Some tha t do are STARES, BULCOW,. ROCKET ,and Certain games are, of. course, more popular with game authors .that others~ There were no less than ten versions of NIM submitted, nine versions each of HORSES and eight versions of CRAPS. Other popular ones were simulations of baseball, basketball, football, blackjack, and hangman. (HorSe Race) and TICTAC (Tic-Tac-Toe), 7 Families of Games A word about the title of the book. The astute, quantitatively oriented reader might notice that there seem to be mor~ than 101 games in the book. 7 are different versions of another game. There are 101 separate write-ups; thus, the title of the book. In fact, there are 108 individual games; Perhaps it is a disease of using the computer or perhaps it is just a compulsion of man that he must categorize things. The games in this book could be categorized by level of difficulty as is often the case in collections of puzzles. They could also be categorized in an educational sense, for example, those that could be used to teach logic principles, those that foster learing by discovery, those that require the user to solve an algebra problem, etcc In the first two groups, Number or Letter Guessing and Piles of Objects, you will probably get more enjoyment if you play the games in the numbered order as there is a definite sequential In the other fourteen categories, nature to their difficulty. the games may be played in any order; one does not generally build upon another except in a few cases. should play~ In particular, you BAGLES before BULCOW before lCHECK HI-Q BATTLE before SALVO GUNNER before SUNERI ROCKET before ROCKT2 HMRABI before KING Equipment to Play, computer and Otherwise Most of the games in this book require no special knowledge, tools or equipment to play, except, of course, a BASIC-speaking computer. Four of the matrix games will probably be more enjoyable if you use a grid or quadrille paper to play. Unless you have a photo graphic memory, QUBIC almost certainly requires a diagram. There is a page included as Appendix B which contains some supplemental diagrams; you may wish to reproduce it if you become addicted to the games on it. with few exceptions, the games all run in "standard" BASIC. Any exceptions are noted in the write-ups under the heading, "computer Limitations." The major difference between various computer systems appears to be in the handling of alphabetic strings. On Digital systems a subscripted string variable. for example, A$(8) or Cl$(15), refers to a variable in an array or matrix. Other BASIC compilers may not have string arrays. 8 On some systems, in particular, Digital's Edusystems 20, 25, and 50, strings are limited to 6 characters. Several strings may, or course, be combined in an array to permit longer than 6-letter words to be used. Many programs use the RANDOMIZE command to start the random number generator at a random point. Some BASIC compilers do not recognize RANDOMIZE and it must be removed in order for the program to run. Digital BASIC permits more than one statement on each program line. Statement separators on the line may be one of three characters - / or :o rO • Digital Equipment Corporation Maynard, Massachusetts July 1973 9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Rusty Whitney Oregon Museum of Science and Industry Portland, Oregon Bob Albrecht People's Computer Company Menlo Park, California Walt Koetke Lexington High School Lexington, Massachusetts Charles Lund The American School of the International Schools The Hague, Netherlands Mary C.

You have an option to bet or not to bet depending on whether or not you feel the next card dealt will have a value between the first two. In the Your initial money (Q) is set to $100; you may alter Statement 170 if you want to start with more or less than $100. The game keeps going on until you lose all your money or interrupt the program. Program Author Bill Palmby Adlai E.

You can choose the dimensions of the maze--i.e. the number of squares wide and Iong-. computer Limitations The amount of memory available will determine the maximum size maze that may be constructed. An 8K EduSystem 20 initialized for one user can draw a l3x13 maze. RSTS/E can draw a 23 (width of paper limit) x 50 maze, even larger using virtual memory.

Unlike other computer games in which the computer picks a number or letter and you must guess what it is, in this game you think of an animal and the computer asks you questions and tries to guess the name of your animal. the computer, guesses incorrectly, it will ask you for a question that differentiates the animal it guessed from the one you were thinking of. In this way the computer IIlearnsll new animals. Questions to differentiate new animals should be input without a question mark. If IMPORTANT: At the end of a playing session, to the question, IIARE YOU THINKING OF AN ANIMAL, II you must respond IISAVE II in order that the computer save all the new animals you have introduced. To that same question, at any point in the game, if you respond IILIST,II the computer will tell you all the animals it knows so far. The program starts originally by knowing only "FISH II and IIBIRD.II Additional animals are stored in the file IIANIMAL.GME. II Computer Limitations This program was written for a DIGITAL RSTS-ll and uses several unique features, in particular, multiple user access to a common data file and several advanced string handling functions. It has been converted with some minor changes to OS/8 BASIC and could be adapted to other systems as well.

The board is divided into six compartments (PITS) on 'my SIDE' and six on 'your SIDE'. addition, there are two special PITS at the ends: and 'your HOME' • 'my HOME' In A MOVE is made by taking all of the beans from any (non-empty) PIT on your own SIDE. Starting from the PIT to the right of this one, these beans are 'SOWN' one in each PIT working around the board anticlockwise. A TURN consists of one or two MOVEs. MOVE is SOWN in your own HOME you may take a second MOVE. If the last bean of your If the last bean SOWN in a MOVE lands in an empty PIT, provided that the opposite PIT is not empty, all the beans in the opposite PIT, together with the last bean SOWN are 'captured' and moved to the player's HOME. When either side is empty, the game is finished. The player with most beans in his HOME has won. 19 In the computer version, the board is printed as 14 numbers representing the 14 PITS. 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 The PITS on your (lower) SIDE are numbered 1-6 from left to right. The PITS on my (the computer's) SIDE are numbered from my left (your right). To make a MOVE you type in the number of a PIT. If the last bean lands in your HOME, the computer types 'AGAIN?' and you then type in your second move. The computer's MOVE is typed, followed by a diagram of the board in its new state. The computer always offers you the first move. This is considered to be a slight advantage. There is a learning mechanism in the program that causes the play of the computer to improve as it plays more games. computer Limitations This program is written in DIGITAL PDP-II BASIC. The only unusual feature is that an IF statement may have the form: IF (CONDITION) THEN (STATEMENT) Whenever the IF condition fails, the program branches to the next line.

You are allowed up to twenty guesses. No digit is repeated. After each guess the computer will give you clues about your guess as follows: PICO FERMI BAGLES One digit is correct, but in the wrong place One digit is in the correct place No digit is correct You will learn to draw inferences from the clues and, with practice, you'll learn to improve your score. There are several good strategies for playing BAGLES. After you have found a good strategy, see if you can improve it. Or try a different strategy altogether and see if it is any better.

The simulation stops at nine innings, hence, it may be a tie game: however, that has proved to occur remarkably few times. computer Limitations The game published was written for DIGITAL EduSystem 15/30/35 and actually consists of two programs, one which prints the rules chained to the second program which plays the game. IINOLINE II must be given before running to prevent overflow. Other BASIC compilers will require conversion of the alphabetic string input statements to a compatible format. Source Another version of baseball was submitted for Timeshared-8 by Jeff Moskow.and Brad Golden of Lexington High School. This is available from DECUS as BASIC 8-562. A second version was submitted by another Lexington High School student, Les Servie. A FORTRAN version was submitted by David Benepe of Fort Worth, Texas. These versions are not printed herein.

You are the Dartmouth captain and control the type of shot and defense during the course of the game. There are four types of shots: 1. Long Jump Shot (30 ft.), 2. Short Jump Shot (15 ft.), 3. Lay Up, and 4. Set Shot. Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it: Press (6), Man-to-man (6.5), Zone (7), or None (7.5). To change defense, type "0" as your next shot. Note: The game is biased slightly in favor of Dartmouth. The average probability of a Dartmouth shot being good is 62.95% compared to a probability of 61.85% for their opponent. (This makes the sample run somewhat remarkable in that Cornell won by a score of 51 to 35. Hooray for the Big Red!)

You and your opponent (the computer) alternately remove objects from the pile. You specify in advance the minimum and maximum number of objects that can be taken on each turn. You also specify in advance how winning is defined: 1. To take the last object or 2. To avoid taking the last object. You may also determine whether you or the computer go first. The strategy of this game is based on modulo arithmetic. the maximum number of objects a player may remove in a turn is M, then to gain a winning position a player at the end of If you his turn must leave a stack of 1 modulo (M+l) coins. don't understand this, play 23 Matches (23 MTCH) first, then BATNUM, and just have fun!

"BATTLE is based on the popular game Battleship which is primarily played to familiarize people with the location and designation of points on a coordinate plane. II BATTLE first randomly sets up the bad guys I fleet disposition on a 6 by 6 matrix or grid. The fleet consists of six ships: Two destroyers (ships number 1 and 2) which are two units long, two cruisers (ships number 3 and 4) which are three units long and two aircraft carriers (ships number 5 and 6) which are four units long. The program then prints out this fleet dis position in a coded or disguised format (see the sample com puter print-out). You then proceed to sink the various ships by typing in the coordinates (two digits, each from 1 to 6, separated by a comma) of the place where you want to drop a bomb, if you I 11 excuse the expression. The computer gives the appropriate responses (splash, hit, etc.) which you should record on a 6 by 6 matrix. You are thus building a representa tion of the actual fleet disposition which you will hopefully use to decode the coded fleet disposition printed out by the computer. Each time a ship is sunk, the computer prints out which ships have been sunk so far and also gives you a "SPLASH/HIT RATIO". The first thing you should learn is how to locate and designate positions on the matrix, and specifically the difference between "3,4" and "4,3". Our method corresponds to the location of points on the coordinate plane rather than the location of numbers in a standard algebraic matrix: The first number gives the column counting from left to'right and the second number gives the row counting from bottom to top. The second thing you should learn about is the splash/hit ratio. "What is a ratio?" A good reply is "Itls a fraction or quotient. II Specifically, the splash/hit ratio is the number of splashes divided by the number of hits. If you had 9 splashes and 15 hits, the ratio would be 9/15 or 3/5, both of which are correct. The computer would give this splash/hit ratio as .6. One of the main objects and primary educational benefits of BATTLE comes from attempting to decode the bad guys I fleet disposition code. To do this, you must make a COMPARISON between the coded matrix and the actual matrix which you con struct as you play the game.

You then pick your target or the type of plane you are flying. Depending upon your flying ex perience and the quality of the enemy defenders, you then may accomplish your mission, get shot down, or make it back through enemy fire. In any case, you get a chance to fly again. Program Author This program was somewhat modified at DIGITAL.

Most computer plots run along the paper in the terminal (top to bottom): however, this plot is drawn horizontally on the paper (left to right). You may specify the initial velocity of the ball and the coefficient of elasticity of the ball (a superballis about 0.85 -- other balls are much less). You also specify the time increment to be used in "strobing" the flight of the ball. In other words, it is as though the ball is thrown up in a darkened room and you flash a light at.fixed time intervals and photograph the progress of the ball.

The computer coaches' one of the boxers and determines his punches and defenses, while you do the same for your boxer. At the start of the match, you may specify your man's best punch and his vulnerability. There are approximately seven major punches per round, although this may be varied in Statement 185. The best two out of three rounds wins. Program Author Jesse Lynch 710 South Point Douglas Road St. Paul, MN 55119 50 PROGRAM LISTING '10 'JS"S HEAD "/ YOUR MAN' S NAMf' 'ROUND "R" 8EGINS ...

You have a choice of three methods of throwing: Throw Description Probable Score 1 2 3 Fast overarm Controlled overarm Underarm Bullseye or complete miss 10, 20, or 30 points Anything You will find after playing a while that different players will swear by different strategies. However, consider the expected score per throw by always using Throw 3 (program line 220): Score (S) Probability (P) S x P 40 30 20 10 o 1.00-.95 = .05 .95-.75 = .20 .75-.45 = .30 .45-.05 = .40 .05 .05-.00 = Expected score per throw = 2 6 6 4 0 18 Calculate the expected scores for the other throws and you may be surprised!

On each pass of the bull, you may try: 0 Veronica (dangerous inside move of the cape) I Less dangerous outside move of the cape 2 Ordinary swirl of the cape Or you may try to kill the bull: 4 Over the horns In the chest 5 The crowd will determine what award you deserve, posthumously if necessary. The braver you are, the better the award you receive. It's nice to stay alive too. The better the job the picadores and toreadores do, the better your chances. This program was converted to standard BASIC (DIGITAL Timeshared-8) by students at Lexington High School under the direction of Walt Koetke.

The road course is fast (speeds up to 200 m.p.h.) •. It is long (5.3 miles) and complex (8 curves and 8 straights). You are racing the latest Group 7 cars (McLarens, Lolas, etc.). The instructions provided by the program are self-explanatory. You should really take heed of track hazards--i.e., rain and oil, except, of course, slowing down too much puts you out of con tention. BEWARE: This game is very challenging and addictive! Computer Limitations The program was written for the Honeywell/GE 635 at Dartmouth. The main inconsistency with other computers is that several people may race using multiple terminals; this is generally not possible on smaller machines. The comments on the listing are extremely comprehensive and entertaining. We apologize for not having a sample run, but it got wiped out.

Facts and figures used are based on the actual occurrence. follow the same strategy used in the actual battle, the results will be the same--generally, this is a good strategy since the generals in the Civil War were fairly good military strategists. However, you can frequently outperform the Civil War generals, particularly in cases where they did not have good enemy in telligence and consequently followed a poor course of action. Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history, although, the computer gives you the rudiments. If you After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to the actual casualties of the pattIe, and you are told whether you win or lose the battle. .

The versio!,\ published here is based on standard Nevada craps table rules. That is: 1. A 7 or lIon the first roll wins 2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses 3. Any other number rolled becomes your "point." You continue to roll~ if you get your point, you win. If you roll a7, you lose and the dice change hands when this happens. . Your stake is set in Statement 2l0~ this could be changed to an input statement if desired. Source An interesting version of CRAPS was submitted by Philip Bieluch of Trinity College which uses a file to keep track of prior winnings and/or losses.

A location is designated by three nuffibers--e.g., 1, 2, 1. The object is to travel from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 by moving one horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time without striking one of 5 randomly placed landmines. You are staked to $500; prior to each play of the game you may make a wager whether you will reach your destination. You lose if you hit a mine or try to make an illegal move--i. e., change more than one digit from your previous position.

The computer program, using pattern recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in the input. The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time. It always guesses first and then examines the next number to see if it guessed correctly. By pure luck (or chance or probability), the com puter ought to be right 10 times. It is uncanny how much better it generally does than that!

The prior racing experience of each dog (wins and losses) has a bearing on the outcome of the race. After this is posted, up to 19 players may bet on a dog. Maximum bet is $500.00 and minimum is $2.00. After all the bets are in, the odds will be posted and the race begins! After each days's racing, the track will close and record the performance of all the dogs in a permanent file which is called the next time the program is run. Computer Limitations DOGS was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50 (Timeshared-8); consequently, the file handling routine (Lines 25, 30, 35, 55, 975, 985, 1085) may have to be changed for other systems. Program Author The author remarks that he is now 15 and started using a PDP-8 at the age of 12. Since then he has compiled 4 notebooks of programs in BASIC, FOCAL, FORTRAN, and ALGOL. Of his 23 BASIC games, 5 are published in this book.

The computer picks a word, tells you how many letters in the word it has picked and then you guess a letter in the word. are right, the computer tells you where that letter belongs~ if your letter is wrong, the computer starts to hang you. You get ten guesses before you are completely hanged: If you Head Body Right and Left Arms Right and Left Legs Right and Left Hands Right and Left Feet In this program, the PRINT statement is abbreviated to "&." You may add words in Data statements following Statement 508~ in this case, you must also change the random word selector in Statement 40. Source Interesting versions of Hangman were received from Brandy Brylawski, a seventh grader at the Eaglebrook School, Deerfield, Mass., and a sophisticated one from W.K.

In a sense, it is like a CAl program except that its responses are just good fun. Whenever a computer is ex hibited at a convention or conference with people that have not used a computer before, the conversational programs seem to get the first activity.

The method described in the article was for a hypothetical learning machine composed of match boxes and colored beads. This has been generalized in the Program HEX. The program learns by elimination of bad moves. All positions encountered by the program and acceptable moves from them are stored in the array P$(I). When the program encounters an. un familiar position, the position and all legal moves from it are added to the list. If the program loses a game, it erases If it hits a position from which the move that led to ·defeat. all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat), it erases the move that got it there and resigns. Eventually, the program learns to play extremely well and, indeed, is unbeatable. The learning strategy could be adopted to other simple games with a finite nwnber of moves (tic-tac-toe, small board checkers, or other chess-based games). For complete playing directions, respond YES or Y to the ques tion, INSTRUCTIONS? Computer Limitations HEX was written in BASIC-PLUS for DIGITAL RSTS-ll and RSTS/E systems. HEX uses string functions and concatenation extensively. Also, the symbol II!" equals REM and "&" equals PRINT. Program Author Jeff Dalton Northfield-Mt.

The directions, in the words of the author of the game, are as follows: "l. There is an amount of money, between one and one hundred dollars, in the "HI-LO" jackpot. 2. You will have six chances in which to guess the amount of money in the jackpot. 3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether the guess was too high or too low. 4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after S. six chances, the computer will print the amount in the jackpot. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the six chance limit, the computer will register this amount. 6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice of playing again or ending the program. game is played, a new amount of money will constitute the jackpot.

READY HleQ Description REMOVE PEGS ON A PEGBOARD This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game of logic called Hi-Q. The game starts with a pegboard shaped like a cross having pegs in every hole but the center. The object is to remove all 32 pegs, or as many as possible, by jumping into an empty hole--the jumped peg is then removed. There are several different winning strategies for playing Hi-Q and, of course, each strategy can be played eight different ways on the board. Can you find a consistent winner?

The city initially has 1,000 acres, 100 people and 3,000 bushels of grain in storage. You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for bushels of grain--the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels per acre. You also must use grain to feed your people and as seed to plant the next year's crop. You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only tend a certain amount of land and that people starve if they are-not fed enough. You also have the unexpected to contend with such as a plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable harvests. You will also find that managing just the few resources in this game is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years. The crisis of population density rears its head very rapidly.

Slap Shot 2. Flick Shot 3. wrist Shot The game is very comprehensive starting with the face-off, and throughout the game with icing and high sticking penalties, shots hitting the post, shots being wide and being blocked by the goalie. In the event of a tie at the end of three periods, the game automatically goes into sudden-death overtime. Program Author Thanks to Mrs. Kingsley Norris for submitting the program.

You can place any number of bets on the outcome of the race. There are four elements to a bet: 1. Horse number (1 to 8) 2. Position (Win=l, P1ace=2, Show=3) 3. Amount of wager ($2 minimum, $300 maximum) 4. Bet signal (1 for more bets to follow, 0 to close betting) The computer then gives you the position of the eight horses at eight points around the raceway. At the end, it tells you what each horse paid and what you won (or didn't win) on each of your bets. Source The published program has been around DIGITAL for as long as anyone can remember. ing horse race progr~s were submitted by Robert Goodman, Southfield, Mich.1 Don Viola, Staten Island, NY1 and Paul Garmon, Wellesley Hills, Mass.

A Hurk1e is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy on a planet named Lirht that has three moons. Hurk1e are favorite pets of the Gwik, the dominant race of Lirht and ••• well, to find out more, read liThe Hurk1e is a Happy Beast" in the book A WAY HOME by Theodore Sturgeon published by Pyramid. In this program a shy hurk1e is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase is point 0,0 in the Southwest corner.

It presents a simple problem: in the air at some random velocity. You then must answer three questions about the flight of the ball: a ball is thrown straight up 1. How high will it go? 2. How long until it returns to earth? 3. What will be its velocity after a random number of seconds? The computer evaluates your performance~ within 15% of the correct answer is considered close enough. After each run, the computer gives you another problem until you interrupt the program.

'~ I GOVERN YOUR OWN ISLAND This is one of the more comprehensive, difficult, and interesting land and resource management games. of these games, start with HMRABI). (If you've never played one In this game, you are Premier of Setats Detinu, a small communist island 30 by 70 miles long. Your job is to decide upon the budget of the country and distribute money to your countrymen from the communal treasury. The money system is Rallods; each person needs 100 Rallods per year to survive. Your country's income comes from farm produce and tourists visiting your magnificent forests, hunting, fishing, etc. Part of your land is farm land but it also has an excellent mineral content and may be sold to foreign industry for strip mining. Industry import and support their own workers. Crops cost between 10 and 15 Rallods per $quare mile to plant, cultivate, and harvest. Your goal is to complete an eight-year term of office without major mishap. To the question, "HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU PLAYED?" answer "0" for a full set of rules, "500" for no explanation, or "1,000" to continue an old game. To stop a running game and continue it later, answer "0" to all questions. This program is available from DECUS as BASIC-8-346, and is called "POLLUTION GAME. II Program Author James A.

There are two players; the game is played on a SxS board and each player has a symbol to represent his own pieces of Ilife l cells belonging to player 1 are represented by 1*1 and live cells belonging to player 2 are represented by the symbol 1#1. Live • The # and * are regarded as the same except when deciding whether to generate a live cell. An empty cell having two 1# 1 and one 1*1 for neighbors will generate a 1#1, i.e. the live cell generated belongs to the player who has the majority of the 3 live cells surrounding the empty cell where life is to be generated, e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 * # # 1 2 3 4 5 A new cell will be generated at (3,3) which will be a 1#1 since there are two 1#1 and one 1*1 surrounding. The board will then become: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 # # 146 On the first move each player positions 3 pieces of life on the board by typing in the co-ordinates of the pieces. of the same cell being chosen by both players that cell is left empty. ) (In the event The board is then adjusted to the next generation .and printed out. On each subsequent turn each player places one piece on the board, the object being to annihilate his opponent's pieces. The board is adjusted for the next generation and printed out after both players have entered their new piece. The game continues until one player has no more live pieces. The computer will then print out the board and declare the winner.

It is good for beginning addition, since the answer can be derived from counting spots on the dice as well as by memorizing math facts or awareness of number concepts. It is especially effective run on an alpha-· numeric CRT terminal. Program Author Jim Gerrish Bernice A. Ray School Hanover, NH 03755 I I .1 ;!

It varies from the actual game only in that The dialog during the game presents complete rules and instruc tions. The inputs are designed so that when anything except the required input is typed in, the entire segment will be ignored. When questions are asked about property to be sold, the full name is required--e.g., STATES AVENUE. In the computer game, you always pay $50 to get out of jail unless you have a "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" card. No double rolls. As in the board game, before you can improve your property (build houses), you must own all of the pieces of that color property--i.e., have a monopoly of a particular color group. The program will automatically ignore attempts to build houses if you don't have a color group monopoly. Here are the color groups for your reference: Purple: BALTIC AVE MEDITERRANEAN AVE Light Blue: ORIENTAL AVE VERMONT AVE CONNECTICUT AVE Maroon: ST. CHARLES PL STATES AVE VIRGINIA AVE Orange: ST. JAMES PL TENNESSEE AVE NEW YORK AVE Computer Limitations Red: KENTUCKY AVE INDIANA AVE ILLINOIS AVE Yellow: ATLANTIC AVE VENTNOR AVE MARVIN GARDENS Green: PACIFIC AVE NORTH CAROLINA AVE PENNSYLVANIA AVE Dark Blue: PARK PL BOARDWALK MNOPLY was written for DIGITAL RSTS-ll or RSTS/E. It requires two virtual memory files which are built via the file-building program.

Homebase (lower left) is position (0,0) and a guess is a pair of whole numbers (0 to 9), separated by commas. The first number is the number of units to the right of homebase and the secondnurnber is the distance above homebase. You get ten guesses to locate the four MUgwurnps~ after each guess, the computer tells you how close you are to each MUgwurnp. Play ing the game with the aid of graph paper and a compass should allow you to find all the Mugwumps in six or seven moves using triangulation--i.e., like LORAN radio navigation.

At some time, everyone has been asked to "think of a number I " and, after going through some process of private calculation, to state the result, after which the questioner promptly tells you the number you originally thought of.' . There are hundreds of varieties of the puzzle. The oldest recorded example appears to be that given in Arithmetica of Nicomachus, who died about the year 120. He tells you to think of any whole number between 1 and 100 and divide it suc cessively by 3, 5, and 7, telling him the remainder in each case. On receiving this information, he prompt+y discloses the number you thought of • Can you discover a simple method of mentally performing this feat? If not, you can see how the ancient matheinatician did it by look ing at Lines 80-100 of the program. Program Author Digital Equipment Corp.

The name, which was coined by the first mathematician to analyze it, comes from an archaic English verb which means to steal or to take away. Objects are arranged in rows between the two opponents as in the following example: xxxxxxx xxxxx xxx X Row 1 Row 2 Row 3 Row 4 7 Objects 5 Objects 3 Objects 1 Object Opponents take turns removing objects until there are none left. The one who picks up the last object wins. The moves are made according to the following two rules: 1. On any given turn only objects from one row may be removed. There is no restriction on which row or on how many objects you remove. Of course, you cannot remove more than are in the row. 2. You cannot skip a move or remove zero obj"ects. The winning strategy can be mathematically defined, however, rather than presenting it here, we'd rather let you find it on your own. HINT: Playa few games with the computer and mark down on a piece of paper the number of objects in each stack (in binary!) after each move. Do you see a pattern emerging? Source One of the most popular computer games. Over 10 versions of NIKwere submitted. One notable one came from Larry Ruane, Mt. Prospect, Illinois, who programmed NIM for a DIGITAL EduSystem 10.

I" I I I, WORD Description WORD GUESSING GAME WORD is similar to Hangman in that the player must guess a word with clues as to lette~ position furnished by the computer. However, instead of guessing one letter at a time, in WORD, you guess an entire word (or group of 5 letters, such as ABCDE). The computer will tell you if any letters in your word are in the mystery word and if any of them are in the correct position. Armed with these clues, you go on guessing until you get the word or, if you can't get it, input a "?" and the computer will tell you the mystery word. You may change the words in Data Statements 512 and 513, but they must be 5-1etter words.

The object of the game is to get the highest grand total score. Each player on his turn receives from the computer the values of 5 pseudo dice. He may then roll as many of them as he wants to again. This may be repeated once again (3 rolls maximum) . To roll again, you tell the computer how many dice you want to re-roll or change and the number of each die. You play 13 rounds for a complete game. After you have finished rolling, you must decide how you want to score the five dice. Typing "SUMMARY" will show you which categories have been used, otherwise, you must decide on one of 13 categories or "ZERO" to eliminate a category with no score. category How Scored ACES TWOS THREES FOURS FIVES SIXES THREE OF A KIND FOUR OF A KIND FULL HOUSE SMALL STRAIGHT LARGE STRAIGHT YAHTZEE CHANCE ZERO· Count and add all ones.

For example, to the command: ZOOP responds with: CAT TRY MONTGOMERY WARD's To the command: ZOOP responds with: Computer Limitations SCRATCH GOT AN ITCH? I I :1 The version of ZOOP printed here was written for DIGITAL Edusystems 15/30/35 and immediately decodes the first two characters input and carries on from there. It is a simple matter to convert ZOOP to a system which has string handling, however, it was felt that this version is more creative. It also happens to be the original.
