```

**Changes Made**

*   Added missing `import logging` and `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Added missing `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` import.
*   Added a docstring to the `load_data` function following RST style.
*   Added basic error handling using `logger.error` for better exception management in the `load_data` function, avoiding excessive `try-except` blocks.
*   Preserved all existing comments (`#`) correctly.
*   Corrected the module docstring to follow RST style.
