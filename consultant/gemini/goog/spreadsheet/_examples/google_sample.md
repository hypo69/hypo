**Key Improvements:**

* **Robust Path Handling:** The code now correctly constructs the path to the client secret file using `Path` objects. This is much safer than string concatenation, especially when dealing with potentially complex directory structures.   The crucial change is using `client_secret_path.parent / 'credentials.json'` to build the path to the `credentials.json` file.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now includes a more informative error message, `print(f"API error: {err}")`, to help with debugging.
* **Explicit Path Existence Check:**  The check `if client_secret_path.exists():` is a good defensive programming practice.


**Explanation of Changes and Important Considerations:**

* **`client_secret_path` Variable:**  This variable now correctly constructs the full path to the client secret file.


* **`credentials.json` Path:** You *must* have a `credentials.json` file in the same directory as the `client_secret_path`. That is, if your `client_secrets_path` is `.../google_api/secrets/client_secret...json`, then you need `.../google_api/secrets/credentials.json`.  The code now constructs the path to `credentials.json` correctly.  This is essential for the authorization flow to work.

* **Hardcoded Spreadsheet ID:**  The `SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` is hardcoded.  While this works for a sample, for production code, you should load this from a configuration file or environment variable to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.


**How to Run:**

1.  **Install Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```

2.  **Download credentials:** Go to the Google Cloud Console, create a new project, enable the Sheets API, and download the appropriate JSON file (`client_secret_920776813054-crpf1rcav3uui51kq9q1lis64glkpatj.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`) and place it inside a `secrets` directory within your project's root directory. 

3. **Create `credentials.json`:**  Download a `credentials.json` file from the Google Cloud Console. Place this in the same directory as your client secret file.

4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

This improved script is more robust and handles potential errors more effectively, ensuring a better user experience. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual values. Remember to replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script. Remember to change the hardcoded spreadsheet ID if you are testing a different spreadsheet.
