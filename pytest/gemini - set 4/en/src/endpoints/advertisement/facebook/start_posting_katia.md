```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `FacebookPromoter` objects. This is essential for testing functions that depend on external resources (like the Facebook API, which can't be directly tested) without relying on external services.  This makes the tests much more reliable and fast.
* **Specific Exception Handling:** The `test_run_campaigns_exception_handling` test now directly asserts that the expected `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised and that the `logger.info` method is called with the correct message.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover valid input, exception handling (specifically for `KeyboardInterrupt`), and (crucially) now a test for `FacebookPromoter` initialization.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions now check specific attributes and methods of the mock objects, ensuring that the interactions are correct (e.g., the `mock_promoter.run_campaigns.assert_called_once_with`).
* **Example for Driver:** I've added an example `test_driver_get_url` to show how you might test methods of the `Driver` class if needed.  This would be necessary if `Driver.get_url()` does any significant work.
* **Invalid Input:** An example `test_run_campaigns_invalid_data`  demonStartes handling a case where the function receives invalid data, triggering a `TypeError` (or other expected exception).

**How to Run:**

Make sure you have pytest installed:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

Save the code above as `test_start_posting_katia.py` and run it from your terminal:
```bash
pytest test_start_posting_katia.py
```

This revised solution is much more robust and useful for testing the code effectively. Remember to adapt the assertions based on the actual behavior of your `FacebookPromoter` class.  If the `run_campaigns()` function has complex interactions, you may need more elaborate mocking and tests.
