This is a good, comprehensive description of the `src.scenario` module and its associated `executor.py` script.  Here are some suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, code quality, and maintainability:

**Docstring Enhancements:**

* **More Specific Examples:**  The example JSON scenario is good, but adding a few more, showing different scenarios (e.g., one with multiple `presta_categories`, one with a custom field, etc.) would be very helpful for users trying to understand how to structure their own scenarios.
* **Parameter Types:**  Explicitly document the expected types for parameters in the functions (e.g., `run_scenario_files(s, scenario_files_list: List[str])`). This improves readability and helps prevent unexpected errors.
* **Error Handling Details:** Add more details about the error handling strategies employed within the code.  Specifically mention if exceptions are caught, logged, and how they're handled (e.g., retry mechanism, logging exceptions, and indicating failures in the journal).
* **Return Values:**  Clearly document the return values of all functions, including success/failure indicators and the type of data returned (e.g., `run_scenario` returning a list of product data or `False` on failure).
* **`main()` Function:** Instead of just stating `main()` exists, provide a more detailed description of its purpose and how to run the script. Include a section discussing required dependencies (e.g., `requests`, `PrestaShop` library) and their installation.  A complete example of how to run the script from the command line would also be very useful.
* **Dependency Management:** Mention using `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies and how to install them (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

**Code Style and Maintainability:**

* **Logging:**  Instead of just printing messages to the console, use a dedicated logging library (e.g., `logging`). This provides better control over log levels (debug, info, warning, error), formatting, and routing (e.g., to a file).  Example: `logging.info("Scenario file processed successfully.")`
* **`execute_prestashop_insert` Asynchronous:** As you mentioned `execute_prestashop_insert` as asynchronous, the code should reflect that. Use a library like `asyncio` for truly asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread.
* **Data Validation:**  Add validation to the `Product` creation and data insertion process to prevent unexpected data issues.  E.g., check if URLs are valid, and that product data types match expected types.
* **`Supplier` Class:**  Describe the `Supplier` class in detail; what attributes does it hold (e.g., `presta_client`)? How is it instantiated (parameters, dependencies)?


**Overall Structure and Organization:**

* **Separate Functions:**  Ensure that `run_scenario`, `insert_grabbed_data`, and `execute_prestashop_insert` (and their respective helper functions) are well-defined, separate functions. This makes the code more modular and easier to test.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Consider further object-oriented design using a `Scenario` class or similar to encapsulate the scenario details. This improves code structure and allows you to encapsulate logic.


**Example `main()` function snippet:**

```python
import logging
import sys

# ... (import other necessary modules and classes) ...

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

    try:
        # Instantiate the Supplier object.
        s = Supplier('aliexpress')
        if len(sys.argv) > 1:
           s.run(*sys.argv[1:])
        else:
           s.run()

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return 1  # Indicate an error to the operating system

    logging.info("All scenarios processed successfully.")
    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```


By incorporating these suggestions, you'll improve the clarity, maintainability, and robustness of your script, making it easier for others to understand, use, and maintain. Remember to add `requirements.txt` to properly manage dependencies. Remember to add error handling and validation to all critical parts of the script.  Test thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
