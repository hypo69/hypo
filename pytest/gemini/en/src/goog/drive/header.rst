**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** `mock_project_structure` and `mock_invalid_project` are introduced to create the necessary project structure for testing `set_project_root` in a controlled and repeatable manner.
    This is crucial for isolating tests and ensuring that they don't interfere with each other.


* **Comprehensive Tests:** Tests now cover scenarios such as finding a root directory containing marker files, a nested directory, or situations where no matching marker files are found. This better validates the correctness of the `set_project_root` function under various conditions.


* **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive, explicitly stating the test case.


* **Error Handling:**  A `test_invalid_settings_json` test case is added, specifically to check for `json.JSONDecodeError`. This improves robustness, ensuring the code handles potential issues. This test utilizes `pytest.raises` to assert the expected exception.


* **Correct `sys.path` assertion:** The test now correctly asserts that the project root is added to `sys.path` when the function is called successfully. This validates a critical aspect of the function's behavior.


* **No Unnecessary Imports:**  Avoids importing modules not needed for the tests.


* **Edge Case for No Marker Files:** Added `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` to cover the case where no marker files are found. This handles an essential edge case.


* **pytest.raises:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test the handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.



**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved test suite provides a more robust and complete set of tests for your `set_project_root` function, covering valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases, thereby increasing the confidence in the function's correctness and reliability. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/goog/drive/header.py` with the actual path to your file if needed.


```python
import sys
```
This line should be added at the top of your test file to import `sys` for the `sys.path` assertion.
