## INSTRUCTION:

Analyze the provided code in detail and explain its functionality. The response should include three sections:  

1. **<algorithm>**: Describe the workflow as a step-by-step flowchart, including examples for each logical block, and illustrate the flow of data between functions, classes, or methods.  
2. **<mermaid>**: Write the diagram code in `mermaid` format, analyze, and explain all dependencies that are imported when creating the diagram.  
    **IMPORTANT!** Ensure that all variable names used in the `mermaid` diagram are meaningful and descriptive. Variable names like `A`, `B`, `C`, etc., are not allowed!  
    
    **Additionally**: If the code includes an import `import header`, add a `mermaid` flowchart explaining `header.py`:
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        Start --> Header[<code>header.py</code><br> Determine Project Root]
    
        Header --> import[Import Global Settings: <br><code>from src import gs</code>] 
    ```

3. **<explanation>**: Provide detailed explanations:  
   - **Imports**: Their purpose and relationship with other `src.` packages.  
   - **Classes**: Their role, attributes, methods, and interaction with other project components.  
   - **Functions**: Their arguments, return values, purpose, and examples.  
   - **Variables**: Their types and usage.  
   - Highlight potential errors or areas for improvement.  

Additionally, build a chain of relationships with other parts of the project (if applicable).  

This ensures a comprehensive and structured analysis of the code.
