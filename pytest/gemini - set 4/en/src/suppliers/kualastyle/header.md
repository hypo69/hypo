**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for testing different scenarios:**
   - `example_project_root`: Creates a temporary directory with necessary files (pyproject.toml, settings.json, README.MD) for successful testing. Crucial for testing the file existence and retrieval logic.
   - `invalid_project_root`: Creates a temporary directory without the necessary files, simulating the case where the root can't be found.

2. **Clear test names:**  Descriptive names like `test_set_project_root_valid_input` improve readability and understanding.

3. **Edge Case:**  The `test_set_project_root_edge_case` now explicitly creates a subdirectory to test the correct root directory finding when the marker file is not at the top level.

4. **Error Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_invalid_input` now correctly handles the case where no marker file is found. The expected output is the current directory.

5. **Cleanup:** The `teardown_module` function now safely removes the temporary directories created by the fixtures after all tests are run.  Crucial for avoiding test failures on subsequent runs. This is a best practice to prevent accumulating temporary files.

6. **`sys.path` Management:** The code now correctly inserts the temporary directory into `sys.path` *before* running `set_project_root` to ensure that the path is effectively used for testing purposes.  This is a more robust and accurate way to test the path-adding functionality.   Removed redundant checks.

7. **Invalid Input Test:** Added a test specifically for the scenario where the marker files are not found to ensure correct handling of such situations.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, covers a wider range of scenarios, and is better structured for robust testing of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`):
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

Run the tests using `pytest`.  Make sure you place this test file in the same directory or a location that's in your pythonpath during execution.


```bash
pytest -v
```
