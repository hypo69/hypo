**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Type Hinting:** Added `List[str]` for `questions_list` to explicitly define its type.  This is generally good practice in Python for better code clarity and maintainability.

* **Error Handling:** The most crucial addition is the `try...except` block around the `handle_message` function. This catches potential exceptions during the process of getting the answer from the AI model. This is essential for robust bot functionality.  It also checks if the `answer` from the model is actually returned.

* **Improved Error Messages:** Instead of just logging the exception, the bot now sends a user-friendly error message. This is extremely important for user experience.  The previous code didn't handle the case where the AI model might not return anything.

* **Logging:**  The `logger.error` now includes the specific error message, which is incredibly valuable for debugging and troubleshooting.  This allows you to see exactly *what* error occurred and potentially find its root cause.

* **Removed Unnecessary `get_handler_for_url`:**  The `get_handler_for_url` function is not used in a helpful way. If you intend to use the handlers that are in the `url_handlers` dictionary, they are called directly within the `handle_message` method.  The previous code has a poorly constructed URL routing system that is likely causing issues and should be replaced.


**Other Important Considerations:**

* **`mexiron` module:**  The `mexiron` object is used without being defined.  You need to ensure that `mexiron` is defined or imported from the appropriate module.

* **`handle_suppliers_response`, `handle_onetab_response`:**  These methods are also critical. If they are causing problems, they should be inspected for error handling as well.


**Example of improved `handle_suppliers_response` (assuming `mexiron` is defined):**


```python
    async def handle_suppliers_response(self, update: Update, response: str) -> None:
        """Handle suppliers' URLs."""
        try:
            if await self.mexiron.run_scenario(response, update):
                await update.message.reply_text('Готово!', parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML)  # Use ParseMode.HTML for formatting
            else:
                await update.message.reply_text('Хуёвенько. Попробуй еще раз.', parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML) # Use ParseMode.HTML for formatting
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error handling suppliers' URLs: {e}")
            await update.message.reply_text(f"An error occurred: {e}", parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML)
```

This example now includes error handling within the method and uses `parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML` for better formatting, which is crucial for sending formatted text using Telegram's markup language.

Remember to adjust the error handling and error messages to fit your specific needs and the structure of your other functions. Always include detailed error handling in production-level code!
