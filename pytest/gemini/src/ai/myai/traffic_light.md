# No testable code provided in the input.  
#  Therefore, no tests can be written.
#  If you provide the actual code, I can create comprehensive tests.

# Example test cases (assuming a hypothetical traffic_light.py)
# Replace these with tests based on the actual code.

**Explanation and Crucial Points**

1. **No Testable Code:** The provided `traffic_light.py` file is completely empty, so there's nothing to test.  My response demonstrates *example* tests for a hypothetical `TrafficLight` class with `change_state` and `get_state` methods.  You **must** replace these examples with tests that correspond to the actual functions and classes in your `traffic_light.py` file.

2. **Example Test Cases:** The example tests demonstrate various aspects:
   - Valid input (`test_traffic_light_initial_state`)
   - State transitions (`test_traffic_light_change_state`)
   - Error handling (`test_traffic_light_invalid_state`).

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_traffic_light_invalid_state` test uses `pytest.raises` to check for the correct exception when an invalid state is provided.

4. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names should be descriptive, indicating the test's purpose (e.g., `test_traffic_light_change_state`).

5. **Fixture Example:** The example shows a `mock_config` function, useful if your code interacts with external files or other resources.  **Adapt** the approach to your actual `traffic_light.py` code.


**How to Use These Tests**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Remove the example `TrafficLight` class and tests.  Create tests that directly target the functions, classes, and methods in your `traffic_light.py` file.

2. **Run the tests:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_traffic_light.py`) and run pytest from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_traffic_light.py
   ```

3. **Review and expand:** Refine the tests, adding more cases to cover various scenarios, edge cases, and error handling.


Remember to provide the actual contents of `traffic_light.py` for accurate and comprehensive tests.
