**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Crucially, the code now uses pytest fixtures (`mock_settings_json`, `mock_settings_file`, `mock_project_root`) to create mock files and data. This isolates the tests from the external filesystem and ensures consistent test conditions.  The `tmp_path` fixture from pytest is used effectively to create temporary directories for these mocks.

2. **Mocking `__file__`:** The `test_set_project_root_valid_input` test correctly simulates the `__file__` variable.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

4. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** Tests now cover scenarios where marker files are not found, or are in the wrong location, or are not valid.

5. **Error Handling:** The code has proper error handling for potential issues like `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` (though these are now tested via the fixture).

6. **`current_path` Argument:** A new test (`test_set_project_root_current_path`)  is added to demonstrate correct handling if the `current_path` is explicitly passed.

7. **Explicit Assertions:** Assertions are clear and check the expected results.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Place the input code (`header.py`) in the same directory.
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This significantly improved solution addresses the limitations of the previous response and provides a robust and maintainable test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py"` with the actual path to your `header.py` file if it's different.
