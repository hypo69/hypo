```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import directly:**  The tests now import the `header` module directly from the correct path, making them more robust.
2. **Fixtures for Data:**  Crucially, fixtures are used to mock `settings.json` and `README.MD` files. This isolates the tests and prevents them from relying on the actual file system, which is essential for reliable testing.  The `mock_settings_file` fixture now properly handles creating the directory structure.
3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The test cases now cover several scenarios, including:
   - Valid file paths.
   - Missing files.
   - Correct retrieval from parent directories.
   - Handling missing/invalid JSON data.
   - Cases where the marker files might not be in the current directory.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive and accurately reflect the purpose of each test.

5. **Exception Handling:**  Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are now included, demonStarting how to handle exceptions gracefully.

6. **Edge Cases:** Tests are added for the case where `settings` is `None` and other edge cases concerning missing data files to validate the robustness of error handling.

7. **`pytest.raises` (Example):** The code now includes a test case for raising `FileNotFoundError` with `pytest.raises` although in this case the exception isn't explicitly raised, so it is not strictly necessary.

8. **`tmpdir` Fixture (pytest):** This fixture is used in the tests to create temporary directories for mocking the necessary files, ensuring that the tests don't interfere with each other or the real file system.

This improved solution provides a much more complete and robust test suite for the `header` module. Remember to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
