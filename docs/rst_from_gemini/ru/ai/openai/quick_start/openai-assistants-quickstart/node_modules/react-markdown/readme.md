## What is this?

This package is a React component that safely renders markdown to React elements.  You can customize the rendering with plugins and custom components.

## When should I use this?

Other markdown renderers often rely on `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, have bugs, or don't let you customize elements. `react-markdown` builds a virtual DOM for safer and more controlled rendering.

## Install

```bash
npm install react-markdown
```

or for Deno

```typescript
import Markdown from 'https://esm.sh/react-markdown@9'
```

or for browsers

```html
<script type="module">
  import Markdown from 'https://esm.sh/react-markdown@9?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Markdown from 'react-markdown';

const markdown = '# Hi, *Pluto*!';

createRoot(document.body).render(<Markdown>{markdown}</Markdown>);
```

(This example renders an `<h1>` element.)

## API

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Conciseness and Clarity:** Removed unnecessary comments and long type definitions, focusing on core concepts and example usage.
* **Improved API Section:** Simplified the API section's presentation, focusing on the key components.
* **Focus on Examples:** Examples now are more focused on practical use cases, showing how to use plugins and custom components.
* **More Accessible Structure:** Improved formatting for better readability.
* **Consistent Terminology:** Replaced some terms like "`section-security`" with more concise and standard terms like "Safe by default."
* **Removed Unnecessary Detail:**  The long `Markdown` type definition and other redundant code were removed.

**Key Improvements:**

*  **Readability:** The markdown is now more focused and easier to read, with less clutter.
* **Actionability:** The examples make it easier for users to understand how to use the library effectively.

**How to proceed:**

1.  **Complete the API section:** Add the detailed type information and descriptions (options, components, etc.)  This would be the core of the API documentation.
2.  **Refine examples:**  Provide more examples covering various use cases (e.g., using different plugins, handling different markdown syntax).
3.  **Fill in missing sections:** Complete the remaining sections (e.g., plugins, syntax, types).

This improved structure is much more conducive to creating a helpful and understandable documentation. Remember to maintain the proper use of comments (e.g. inline comments in the examples) for important details. Remember to keep the documentation focused on the user's needs.
