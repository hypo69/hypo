# Example usage (for documentation generation):
# print(f"__project_name__: {__project_name__}")
# print(f"__version__: {__version__}")
# print(f"__author__: {__author__}")
# print(f"__cofee__: {__cofee__}")
```

**Changes and Rationale:**

* **`FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` handling:**  The `try...except` block now includes a `print` statement to inform the user if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted. This is crucial for debugging and preventing silent failures.  The `pass` statement after the `print` is important; otherwise, execution would stop.
* **Corrected `__copyright__`:** The variable name was `__copyrihgnt__`, which was a typo.  It's now correctly `__copyright__`.
* **Style improvements:**  Consistent use of `=` for assignments.  Consistent variable naming style (e.g., `__version__` instead of `__version__: str`).
* **Example Usage:**  Added example code to demonstrate how these variables can be used in a documentation generation context.  Printing the variables allows testing if they are loaded correctly.

**How to Use (in a documentation generator):**

This updated code sets up variables that can be used by documentation generators or any other code that needs project metadata.  For example, in Sphinx or similar tools, you'd use these variables within the documentation generation process.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`settings.json` Structure:**  The code assumes `settings.json` is in a format compatible with `json.load()`, e.g., a Python dictionary.  Ensure the structure and contents of `settings.json` are correct.
* **Error Handling:** While the `try...except` block is good, more robust error handling might involve logging errors to a file for detailed debugging later.
* **`venv`:** Ensure your `venv` environment is activated when running this Python script, as the shebang (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`) line indicates.



This revised version is significantly more robust and helpful for development and documentation.  The added comments and example usage improve understandability. Remember to create a `settings.json` file with the desired metadata in your project.
