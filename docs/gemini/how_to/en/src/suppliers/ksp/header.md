How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/ksp/header.py` file

This file sets up the project environment and gathers project metadata.  It's crucial for starting your project's execution.

**1. Project Structure:**

The script assumes a standard project structure with `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git` files (or similar directories) residing within the project's root directory. It searches upward from the file's location to find this root.

**2. `set_project_root` Function:**

```python
def set_project_root(marker_files=(\'pyproject.toml\', \'requirements.txt\', \'.git\')) -> Path:
    """
    Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file\'s directory,
    searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.

    Args:
        marker_files (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.
    
    Returns:
        Path: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.
    """
    __root__:Path
    current_path:Path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    __root__ = current_path
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
            __root__ = parent
            break
    if __root__ not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))
    return __root__
```

This function is critical. It locates the project's root directory.  The `marker_files` argument allows you to customize the files/directories used to identify the project root.  Crucially, it adds the root directory to `sys.path`, ensuring Python can import modules from the project's source code.


**3. Project Metadata:**

The script gathers project metadata from `settings.json` (located in `src/settings.json`) and `README.MD` (located in `src/README.MD`) files.

```python
settings:dict = None
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / \'src\' /  \'settings.json\', \'r\') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```
```python
doc_str:str = None
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / \'src\' /  \'README.MD\', \'r\') as settings_file:
        doc_str = settings_file.read()
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```

This code attempts to load the settings and project description from the files.  Error handling (`try...except`) is important to gracefully manage cases where these files are missing or malformed.  


**4. Variables:**

Several variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`) are then populated with values from `settings`.  This enables easy access to project information.

**5. Imports:**
```python
import sys
import json
from packaging.version import Version

from pathlib import Path
from src import gs
```
The imports define necessary modules like `sys`, `json`,  `packaging.version` (for version handling), and `pathlib` for file path management.

**Usage Example (in another script):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ksp.header import __project_name__

print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path.root`:** This code assumes a `gs` module (likely for global settings) exists and defines a `path` attribute with a `root` member, to properly locate the `settings.json` file and `README.MD` file.  The `gs` module is part of your project's structure.  Make sure this module and its `path.root` member are correctly defined.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are crucial for robustness.  The script should gracefully handle cases where the data files are missing or invalid, preventing unexpected crashes.

* **`MODE` Variable:** The `MODE = 'dev'` variable is likely related to configuration, but its usage isn't detailed in the provided context.
