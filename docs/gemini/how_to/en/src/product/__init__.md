## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/product/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/product/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for the `product` package.  It imports necessary classes and functions from submodules, making them accessible from other parts of the project.

**Key Concepts:**

* **External Classes/Attributes:** This module exposes several key classes and attributes that are crucial for working with product data:
    * **`Product`:**  A class representing a product.  Detailed methods and attributes are described in `product.py`.  Use this class to interact with product data.
    * **`ProductFields`:** A class that defines the different fields associated with a product.  The description for this class is in `product_fields.py`.  This class likely defines the structure of product attributes.
    * **`record`:**  A dictionary holding product fields in a flattened format.  This means that nested or structured data is converted into a simple key-value structure, potentially for easier processing or storage.
    * **`translate_presta_fields_dict`:**  A function specifically designed to translate multilingual fields within `ProductFields` objects.  This function handles the translation logic.

* **Module-Level Constant `MODE`:** This variable is set to 'dev'. It suggests that the module is intended for development use, potentially affecting behavior in a specific environment.


**How to Use:**

1. **Import Necessary Components:**

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.product import Product, ProductFields, translate_presta_fields_dict
   ```

2. **Instantiate Classes (e.g., `Product`)**:

   ```python
   # Assuming you have product data.
   my_product_data = { ... }  # replace with actual product data
   my_product = Product(my_product_data)
   ```
   This would create an instance of the `Product` class, populated with product data.

3. **Use `ProductFields` (e.g., to access and manipulate specific fields):**

   ```python
   my_product_fields = ProductFields()
   # Access specific fields (methods and attributes of ProductFields class would be described in product_fields.py)
   specific_field_value = my_product_fields.get_field_value(my_product, 'name')  # example
   ```

4. **Translate multilingual fields using `translate_presta_fields_dict`:**


   ```python
   translated_fields = translate_presta_fields_dict(my_product_fields.fields, source_language, target_language)
   ```

   This would translate the field's data to another language. `source_language` and `target_language` variables must be provided.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`product.py` and `product_fields.py`:**  Refer to those files for the specific details regarding the `Product` and `ProductFields` classes, including their available methods and attributes.  The detailed descriptions within those files will be crucial for your implementation.


**Example illustrating `translate_presta_fields_dict`:**


```python
from hypotez.src.product import translate_presta_fields_dict, ProductFields

# Example usage (replace with actual product fields)
product_fields = ProductFields()
product_fields.fields = {'name': 'Product Name', 'description': 'Description in French'}
translated_fields = translate_presta_fields_dict(product_fields.fields, 'fr', 'en')
# Output would be translated product fields from fr to en
```


By following these steps and referring to the details in `product.py` and `product_fields.py`, you can effectively utilize the functionality provided by `hypotez/src/product/__init__.py`. Remember to replace the placeholder data with your actual data.
