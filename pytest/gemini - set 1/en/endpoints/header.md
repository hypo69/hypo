```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Critically, the code now uses `mock_settings_json` to create a temporary `settings.json` file for testing. This avoids issues with interacting with the file system during testing.
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** This is crucial for creating temporary files and directories within the test environment. Using `pytest.tmp_path` to handle temporary file creation.
* **`monkeypatch` for `PYTHONPATH`:**  The original code relied on `sys.path`. This test now uses `monkeypatch` to modify `PYTHONPATH` during the test, ensuring that tests don't interfere with each other.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are now more specific and handle both `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more precisely reflect the test conditions.
* **Isolated Tests:** The tests now effectively use a temporary project structure and mocked files to avoid affecting other tests.
* **Edge Case Tests:** Added tests for cases where marker files aren't found or the script is run from a subdirectory.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/endpoints/header.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and reliable testing suite, suitable for real-world Python applications. Remember to replace `"temp_settings.json"` with the correct path if you are using a different file.
