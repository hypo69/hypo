# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/scenario/header.py`

This file, `header.py`, sets up the project environment and loads configuration data.  It's crucial for initializing the project and accessing various settings, version information, and documentation.

## 1. Project Root Detection (`set_project_root`)

The function `set_project_root` is the heart of the initialization process. It finds the root directory of the project from the current file's location.

```python
def set_project_root(marker_files=(\'pyproject.toml\', \'requirements.txt\', \'.git\')) -> Path:
```

**Arguments:**

*   `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names that indicate the project's root.  Crucially, it defaults to `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git`.  This assumes these files are located in the project root.

**Functionality:**

The function starts at the directory of the current file and recursively checks parent directories until it finds one containing any of the specified marker files. It then returns the path to that directory.

*   Importantly, if the root directory is not found in the `sys.path`, it adds it to `sys.path`.  This allows Python to import modules from the project's source code.

**Example Usage (in your project):**

```python
__root__ = set_project_root()
```


## 2. Loading Settings (`settings` variable)

The script loads settings from a JSON file named `settings.json` located in the project's `src` directory.

```python
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / \'src\' /  \'settings.json\', \'r\') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```

*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block gracefully handles cases where the `settings.json` file is missing or the JSON format is invalid.  This prevents the script from crashing.

## 3. Loading Documentation (`doc_str` variable)

The script loads the project's documentation from a file `README.MD` in the project's `src` directory.

```python
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / \'src\' /  \'README.MD\', \'r\') as settings_file:
        doc_str = settings_file.read()
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```

This is similar to the settings loading but focuses on documentation.


## 4. Project Information Variables

The script then extracts various pieces of project information from the `settings` dictionary.  Critically, it uses `.get()` to safely access values and provides default values if any setting is missing.  This avoids `KeyError` exceptions:


```python
__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__: str = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__: str = doc_str if doc_str else ''
# ...more variables
```

This establishes core project metadata which is likely used in other parts of the project.

**Crucial Dependencies:**


*   The `gs` module:  This file relies heavily on a `gs` module for accessing the project root (`gs.path.root`). You need to ensure this module is correctly imported and available in your project.
*   The `json` and `pathlib` modules: These are needed for file handling.


**Important Considerations:**


*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are essential to prevent the script from failing if the required files are not found.
*   **`sys.path` Modification:**  The `set_project_root` function modifies `sys.path`. This enables importing modules from the project's source code.

This guide explains the core functionality of `header.py` and should help you understand its purpose and use. Remember to consult the documentation or any specific details for how `gs` is being used in your project.
