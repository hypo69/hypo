**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_value`).
* **Import Statements:**  Explicitly imports the necessary attributes from the `version.py` module.
* **Type Checking:**  Checks the data types of `__version__`, `__author__`, `__details__`, `__doc__`, and `__name__` to ensure they are strings, as expected.  Crucially, `__annotations__` is now checked to ensure it's a dictionary. This is important for comprehensive testing.
* **Edge Cases (for `__name__`):** The crucial addition is the check for `__name__ == "__main__"`. This is a necessary edge case because a test might run as a module or as a script.   It ensures the test works correctly whether it's called from another script or directly executed.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is a crucial addition to handle potential exceptions.  Running tests in different environments might not have the same `__main__` structure and handling this gracefully is needed.  I've made the exception handling more robust to help you potentially adapt it to specific testing scenarios later.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal:

```bash
pytest test_version.py
```

This will execute the tests and report any failures.  The error handling in the `test_name_string` function is important because there might be situations where `__main__` isn't available or a test is being run as a module rather than a script.

This improved solution is much more comprehensive and robust, especially when considering potential testing scenarios. Remember to place `test_version.py` in a directory that pytest can find relative to the `version.py` file.


Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
