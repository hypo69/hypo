```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Included a `log_file_path` fixture to create and remove temporary log files for tests, preventing conflicts between tests.  Crucially, it ensures that the file is deleted after each test, making the tests more robust and avoiding file system issues.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and meaningful.  Instead of just checking for the presence of a string, it now uses `assert "..." in log_content`.  This approach provides better error messages when a test fails.

3. **Exception Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` for testing exceptions (invalid log level, invalid file path), which are important for robustness.  These tests ensure the logger handles invalid input gracefully and raises the appropriate exceptions.

4. **Comprehensive Exception Testing:** Added `test_exception_inheritance` to specifically test how custom exception types are handled and logged.

5. **Example Assertions:** The `test_logger_different_levels` tests include a placeholder for better assertion practices (e.g., checking for the presence of different log messages with different severity levels). This needs to be adapted depending on the exact format of the logger output.

6. **Edge Cases:** Included a test for an invalid log level and a test for an invalid file path.

7. **Specific Exception Tests:** Added `test_logger_custom_exception` to test logging of a specific exception type from the provided code.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Logger Implementation Details:** Adapt the assertions to match the specific format and behavior of the `logger` object in your `hypotez.src.logger` module.  If the logger writes to a file with a particular format (e.g., timestamped), the assertions must reflect that.

* **`logger.exception_log`:** Replace `logger.exception_log` with the actual attribute or method of your logger object to capture the exception log.


This improved test suite is more comprehensive, robust, and reflects good testing practices, especially regarding exception handling and file management. Remember to replace placeholders and adapt the tests based on your specific logger implementation.
