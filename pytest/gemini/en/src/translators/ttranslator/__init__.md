```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.translators.ttranslator import MODE

# Tests for MODE constant
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks the value of the MODE constant."""
    assert MODE == 'dev'

# No other functions/classes are present in the input code, 
# so no other tests are needed.  Adding tests for potentially
# missing or important aspects is left as an exercise for the
# user.  e.g., if the file imported 'Translatorr', then
# testing Translatorr methods/attributes would be important
# to ensure its correct operation.
