# Changes Made

- Added missing imports (none needed).
- Rewrote all comments and docstrings in reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Replaced vague terms with specific ones in comments.
- Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks.
- Created separate functions (`sustainable_living_strategy`, `remote_work_strategy`) to structure the code better and make it reusable.
- Added detailed comments using the `#` symbol to explain code blocks when necessary.
- Converted original content into Python code dictionaries to represent content strategies; this is a placeholder and requires actual file handling for proper implementation.
- Removed unnecessary content structure (headers, lists) from the Python code; these were better represented in the RST docstrings.
