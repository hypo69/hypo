**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Function Names:** The test names now more accurately reflect the tested aspect, improving readability.

2. **Fixtures (Optional):**  The example now includes a `graber_instance` fixture, which is crucial if your `Graber` class has a constructor that requires arguments.  This isolates the test from needing to create new Graber instances in each function.

3. **Detailed Assertions:** Added more specific assertions for the `test_graber_fetch_data` example. Critically, I've included `assert isinstance(data, list)` or `assert isinstance(data, dict)`. The important thing is to **validate the type** and structure of the returned data to ensure it's not returning `None`, `str`, or other unwanted types.

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  The `test_graber_fetch_data_invalid_input` and `test_graber_fetch_data_edge_case` examples demonstrate how to test for exceptions and edge cases.  **Crucially**, it shows how to use `pytest.raises` or how to check if the error type/message is correct.

5. **Example `save_data` test:** Demonstrates how to test a method like `save_data` and includes cleanup using `finally` block.  The example assumes there is a `fetch_data` method, which is very typical. The most important part is handling the file creation/cleanup correctly. 


**Before running the tests:**

- **Replace placeholders:** Replace `"valid_url"` with an actual valid URL or a source of valid data, and `"invalid_url"` with a known invalid URL.
- **Implement `Graber` methods:** Complete the `Graber` class methods (`fetch_data`, `save_data`, etc.) if they don't already exist.
- **Install pytest:**
```bash
pip install pytest
```

- **Run the tests:** Navigate to the directory containing the test file in your terminal and run:

```bash
pytest
```

This improved example provides a much more robust and practical set of tests. Remember to adapt these examples based on the actual methods and functionality of your `Graber` class.  The examples demonstrate how to use exceptions in a controlled way and ensure correct handling in edge cases.  This is essential for real-world testing.
