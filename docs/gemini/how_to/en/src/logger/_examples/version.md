How to use the `version.py` file

This guide explains how to interact with the `version.py` file, which appears to be a module defining version information for a logger module.

**Understanding the Structure**

The file `version.py` defines various variables crucial for identifying the module's version and metadata.  Crucially, it appears to be a *configuration* file, not a script to run directly.

**Key Variables**

* **`__version__`:**  This string variable stores the specific version number of the module. In this case, `__version__="3.12.0.0.0.4"`.
* **`__name__`:** This variable's value is dynamically determined.  If you run `version.py` directly, `__name__` will be `"__main__"`. However, if you import it into another script, `__name__` will be "version".
* **`__doc__`:** This string contains the module's documentation.  Its current form has multiple docstrings, and the correct way to use them would be in a documentation generation system (e.g., Sphinx).
* **`__details__`:**  This variable contains descriptive text related to the module version, for example, what the version pertains to. In this case, `__details__="Details about version for module or class"`.
* **`__annotations__`:** This variable could contain type hints (Python 3.5+), but currently remains empty.
* **`__author__`:** Specifies the author(s) of the module.

**How to Use (Indirectly)**

You don't typically run this file directly. Instead, you import it into another Python script (e.g., a main script that uses the logger).  For example:

```python
import hypotez.src.logger._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.logger._examples.version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(hypotez.src.logger._examples.version.__name__)  # Output: version (if imported) or __main__ (if run)
print(hypotez.src.logger._examples.version.__author__) # Output: hypotez
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Module Path:**  The import path (`hypotez.src.logger._examples.version`) is crucial. Ensure the path is correct relative to where you're running your script.
* **Documentation:** The file contains multiple multiline docstrings (using triple quotes).  The format is suitable for documentation generation (e.g., using Sphinx).  A proper documentation generator would be necessary to understand and interpret these docstrings.
* **Purpose:** The `MODE = 'dev'` variable likely controls the logging behaviour or configuration in your logger module.  This variable is best understood in context of the rest of your project's code.


This usage guide focuses on interacting with the `version.py` file. To use the logger, you'll need to refer to its own documentation and implementation.
