```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the input type and expected behavior.
* **Comprehensive Cases:** Added tests for empty lists, invalid input types, edge cases (empty string, valid URL), and handling of non-string product IDs.
* **Exception Handling:** Used `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` when encountering invalid input types (non-string or `WindowsPath`).
* **Mocking `logger`:**  Critically important for testing functions that call `logger.error`.  The `mock_logger` function is now defined to intercept the calls. This prevents the test from failing because the logging system isn't configured.
* **Edge Cases:** Added test `test_ensure_https_empty_list` and `test_ensure_https_single_empty_id` to cover empty input scenarios, which are very important for real-world code.
* **`ensure_https_single` Tests:**  Added tests specifically for the inner function to check its behavior separately from the list handling of `ensure_https`.
* **`TypeError` Handling:**  Added a test `test_ensure_https_invalid_input` to ensure the function correctly handles various invalid input types and exceptions.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `ensure_https` function, including important edge cases and error handling. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`).  Importantly, it ensures that your tests aren't affected by the external logging setup. Remember that you need to have the `src.logger` and `extract_prod_ids` modules correctly imported and available in your test environment.  If the `extract_prod_ids` function is not yet complete, make sure to have a placeholder implementation in your tests (or use a mock to test the function's output).
