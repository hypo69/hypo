```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition of `try...except` blocks around `set_project_root`, loading `settings.json`, and loading `README.MD` is essential. This prevents the script from crashing if these files aren't found or have invalid formats.  Now it prints informative error messages and defaults to empty values for variables. Crucially, it propagates the original exception when `set_project_root` encounters a problem, making debugging easier.  If there is a problem with `set_project_root` it now exits with an error code (1).

* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more informative, telling you *which* file was problematic.

* **Empty Dictionary for Missing Settings:**  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupt, `settings` is now set to an empty dictionary (`{}`). This prevents `settings.get()` from raising an AttributeError later on when trying to access non-existent keys.

* **Corrected Variable Name:**  `copyrihgnt` was changed to `copyright` to match the intended variable name.

* **Explicit `FileNotFoundError` handling in `set_project_root`:** This prevents a cryptic error message if there's no project root.

* **`__root__` assignment:** The correct path is stored in `__root__` and used in other parts of the code.

* **Docstring Enhancement:** Improved the docstring for `set_project_root` to include a `Returns` section describing the possible return types.


This revised code is much more robust and user-friendly, providing helpful feedback and preventing unexpected crashes. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pip install packaging`.  It now handles potential errors gracefully, which is vital for real-world code. Remember to adjust the `gs` import path if it's not correctly located in your project.
