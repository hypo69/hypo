**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial addition is mocking the `Graber` class.  Real-world tests shouldn't rely on external dependencies (like network requests) for their execution.  Using `pytest.mock` to create mock objects is highly recommended.  This example demonstrates mock implementations to test cases with empty or invalid data.

2. **Specific Assertions:**  Instead of just checking the type of the return value, add more specific assertions about the expected structure of the data.  What kind of data do `get_list_categories_from_site` and `get_list_products_in_category` return? Are they lists of dictionaries?  Add assertions to check these details.

3. **Exception Handling:** The `pytest.raises` context manager is used correctly to test for specific exceptions (`ValueError` in this case).  It checks both for the exception being raised and for the expected error message.

4. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are descriptive and clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Data:** The example now includes tests for empty responses and invalid inputs.  Robust tests check various conditions, including missing data or unexpected types.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage (Crucial):**  Add more tests based on the specific requirements of your actual implementations.  The example now has basic tests;  add more tests based on your data structure, input parameters, and potential error cases.

**Before running the tests:**

* **Install pytest:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

* **Replace the placeholder `Graber` calls:** Replace the placeholder `Graber` instantiation with a proper mocking using `pytest.mock` for better testability and avoiding external dependencies.  An example is shown above using a `MockGraber` class.

* **Adapt to your specific scenario:** Tailor the test cases to the actual function signatures, return values, and expected error handling.  Analyze the data structures returned by these functions in your actual `bangood` module.


By making these changes, you will have a significantly improved set of tests that provide more robust and dependable coverage of the functions under test. Remember to adjust the tests according to the details of the `Graber` and data handling in your actual code.
