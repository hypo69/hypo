**Changes Made**

- Added a `start_posting_katia()` function to encapsulate the main logic.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added type hints (e.g., `filenames: list`).
- Added error handling using `try-except` and `logger.error` to catch and log potential exceptions. The previous exception handler for `KeyboardInterrupt` is included in the new `try-except` statement.
- Added a `finally` block to ensure the browser is closed, even if errors occur.
- Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure the `start_posting_katia()` function is called only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
- Corrected typos and formatting for better readability.
- Added comments (docstrings) using reStructuredText (RST) format to document the function, parameters, and return values.  Corrected RST formatting.
- Removed unnecessary `MODE` variable.
- Removed unused `import json`.
- Improved error handling and added a `finally` block to ensure the browser is closed properly.
- Added the necessary imports (from `src.utils.jjson` and `sys` for exit).
- Corrected `d = Driver(Chrome)` to `d = Driver(Chrome())` (Chrome() should be called).
- Corrected the `filenames` list creation and corrected the `campaigns` list creation.
