How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/__init__.py` module
==============================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python module, `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/__init__.py`, likely serves as an entry point for scenarios related to the AliExpress supplier integration.  It initializes a mode (likely for development or production) and imports the `login` function from another file within the same package.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The `MODE` variable is set to the string value 'dev'.  This likely signifies the operational mode for the application.

2. **Import:** The code imports the `login` function from the `.login` module within the same directory.  This suggests that the `login` function contains the implementation for authenticating with the AliExpress platform.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
# Example usage (within a larger script)

# Assuming the necessary imports are already made in your script
import hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.scenarios as aliexpress_scenarios

# Set the mode if needed (currently set to 'dev')
# aliexpress_scenarios.MODE = 'prod'

# Call the login function (this assumes the login function is defined in the .login module)
# Replace with your actual authentication credentials.
try:
    result = aliexpress_scenarios.login(username='your_username', password='your_password')
    print(f"Login result: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Login failed: {e}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Context:**  The example assumes you're working with a complete project using this module.  It lacks context about how to use the `login` function.  This module, by itself, only defines a constant and imports a function; it does not provide executable logic.

* **Error Handling:** The provided example now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during login.  This is crucial for robust code.

* **Credentials:**  Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your actual AliExpress credentials. **Never hardcode sensitive data into your codebase.** Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system instead.


This enhanced usage example provides a more realistic and robust way to interact with the code. Remember to adapt the example to your specific needs and the expected function signature of the `login` function.
