**Changes Made**

* Added a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during product ID extraction.  This was added to prevent unexpected crashes.
* Replaced the commented-out code with a call to `extract_prod_ids`.  The original code was overly complex and inefficient.  The use of regex to find a simple numeric string was completely unnecessary as the `extract_prod_ids` function likely already handles this and other valid formats.
* Added comprehensive RST documentation for the `get_product_id` function.
* Added `from src.logger import logger` to properly log errors.  Using the logger is vital for debugging and maintaining code health in production environments.
* Replaced the deprecated code. The original code (now commented out) attempted to parse a product ID from different formats, which was handled inefficiently by a regex. The assumption is that `extract_prod_ids` already handles these variations more effectively.
*  Consistently used `' '` single quotes instead of `"` double quotes throughout the code.
* Improved error handling with a `logger.error` call to capture any exceptions during execution and provide more context.
