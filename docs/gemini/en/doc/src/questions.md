# Questions Module

## Overview

This module contains a set of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers.  The questions are stored in a structured format, aiming to improve AI model understanding.

## Questions

### `Why are config files named after the module (e.g., suppliers.json)? Is it not better to name them config.json?`

**Description:** This question explores the rationale behind the naming convention for configuration files.

**Answer:**

The filenames are chosen for improved understanding by AI models.  Using module-specific names (e.g., `suppliers.json`) allows the AI model to associate the configuration settings directly with the relevant module. This semantic connection aids in the interpretation and application of the configuration data.  Using a generic name like `config.json` might not provide the same context.
