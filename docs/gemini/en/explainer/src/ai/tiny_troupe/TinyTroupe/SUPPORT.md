For help and questions about using this project, please consult our Wiki or post on our Discussion forum, both right here on GitHub.

    A[User has Question/Bug] --> B{Search Existing Issues};
    B -- Yes --> C[File New Issue];
    B -- No --> D[Consult Wiki/Post on Forum];
    C --> E[Issue Tracked];
    D --> F[Help/Question Resolved];
```

### <algorithm>

1. **User has Question/Bug:** A user encounters a problem or has a question related to the TinyTroupe project.
2. **Search Existing Issues:** The user checks if a similar issue or question has already been reported on the GitHub issue tracker.
3. **File New Issue (or) Consult Wiki/Forum:**
    * If a matching issue is found, the user proceeds no further, or if no matching issue is found the user creates a new issue on the GitHub Issue tracker, or if the problem doesn't merit a formal issue, they consult the project's Wiki or Discussion forum.
4. **Issue Tracked (or) Help/Question Resolved:**  The issue is documented for the development team to address or the user receives assistance and resolves the issue on their own.

### <explanation>

This file (`SUPPORT.md`) is a support document for the TinyTroupe project, likely a part of a larger project structure. It provides guidelines for users on how to report issues, get help, and understand the support policy.

* **Imports:** There are no imports in this markdown file, as it is purely text-based documentation.


* **Classes:** No classes are present.


* **Functions:** No functions are present.


* **Variables:** No variables are present.


* **Potential Errors/Areas for Improvement:** The documentation could benefit from providing more specific details, such as linking to relevant parts of the project's codebase for easier navigation. Providing clear, concise guidance on the issue reporting process will reduce the time taken for troubleshooting for users. An example could include a section outlining the expected format for bug reports.


* **Relationships with other parts of the project:** The `SUPPORT.md` document is a component of the overall TinyTroupe project. It provides a way for users to get assistance, report bugs, or ask questions. It's important to note that its functionality depends on the actual project structure and existence of GitHub Issues, Wiki, and Forum components.  This documentation is likely intended to complement other project files, like source code and configuration documents.
