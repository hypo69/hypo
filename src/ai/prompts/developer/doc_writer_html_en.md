<!-- INSTRUCTION -->

<p>You must document code in the following style. All comments in the code, including module, class, and function descriptions, should be written in <code>Markdown (.md)</code> format. For each module, class, and function, follow this template:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Module</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The module description should be written at the top, indicating its purpose.</li>
      <li>Provide examples of using the module, if possible. Code examples should be enclosed in a fenced code block with the <code>python</code> language identifier.</li>
      <li>Specify the platforms and synopsis of the module.</li>
      <li>Use headers to describe attributes and methods of the module where necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of module documentation:</p>
    <pre><code>markdown
# Module: Programming Assistant

This module contains the `CodeAssistant` class, which is used to interact with various AI models, such as Google Gemini and OpenAI, for code processing tasks.

## Example Usage

Example of using the `CodeAssistant` class:

```python
assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='ru', model=['gemini'])
assistant.process_files()
```
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Classes</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Each class should be described according to its purpose. Include the class description, its attributes, and methods.</li>
      <li>In the class section, list all methods, their purpose, and examples of usage.</li>
      <li>For each method, include descriptions of its parameters and return values, as well as examples.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of class documentation:</p>
    <pre><code>markdown
# Class: CodeAssistant

The `CodeAssistant` class is used to interact with various AI models such as Google Gemini and provides methods for analyzing and generating documentation for code.

## Attributes
- `role`: The role of the assistant (e.g., 'code_checker').
- `lang`: The language the assistant will use (e.g., 'ru').
- `model`: List of AI models used (e.g., `['gemini']`).

## Methods
### `process_files`

Method for processing code files.

## Example Usage

```python
assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='ru', model=['gemini'])
assistant.process_files()
```
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Functions and Methods</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Document each function or method by specifying parameters and return values.</li>
      <li>For each function, provide a description of its purpose and usage examples in fenced code blocks with the <code>python</code> language identifier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of method documentation:</p>
    <pre><code>markdown
# Method: process_files

This method is used to analyze and process code files.

## Parameters
- `files`: A list of files to process.
- `options`: Additional parameters for configuring the processing.

## Return Value
- Returns the processing result as a list of analyzed data.

## Example Usage

```python
assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='ru', model=['gemini'])
result = assistant.process_files(files=['file1.py', 'file2.py'], options={})
```
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Code Comments</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>All comments in the code should be written in Markdown format and should explain what the specific part of the code does.</li>
      <li>Leave comments in blocks, not in lines. Use comments to describe the logic and explain decisions or temporary solutions in the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>markdown
# Here, the exception is being handled to continue execution if the file is not found
try:
    process_file(file)
except FileNotFoundError as ex:
    handle_exception(ex)
</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Exceptions</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Document exceptions for classes, methods, and functions.</li>
      <li>Specify which exceptions can be raised and under what circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of exception documentation:</p>
    <pre><code>markdown
# Exception: File Not Found

This exception is raised when a file is not found during processing.

## Parameters
- `file`: The path of the file that was not found.

## Example Usage

```python
try:
    open(file)
except FileNotFoundError as ex:
    raise FileNotFoundError("File not found") from ex
```
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Follow these instructions for documenting your code. All comments should be clear, informative, and compliant with the Markdown standard.</p>
