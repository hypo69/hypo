# Changes Made

- Added missing type hints for `language` and `currency` in `__init__`.
- Added missing type hints to `delete_product`
- Refactored comments to use RST format.
- Removed redundant code and comments.
- Added `exc_info` parameter to `delete_product` for more informative error logs.
- Replaced vague terms with more specific ones in comments.
- Consistently used single quotes for strings within the Python code.
- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
- Improved variable names and added comments for clarity.
- Ensured adherence to Python docstring standards.
