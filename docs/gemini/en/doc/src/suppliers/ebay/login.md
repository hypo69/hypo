# hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/login.py

## Overview

This module contains the eBay login functionality, likely using a web driver.  It defines constants and potentially contains the logic for interacting with the eBay login page.  The image `login.png` is referred to, but not included.


## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string constant.  Presumably used to set the operational mode (e.g., development, production).

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Functions

(No functions are defined in the provided code snippet.  Further analysis or the full code would be necessary to document functions.)


## Notes

The code includes numerous multi-line string comments that appear to be intended for documentation, but they are not formatted correctly for use in a docstring.  These comments should be converted to proper docstrings in the Python code for accurate documentation.  The code also includes markdown-style syntax within docstrings (`@image html login.png`). This is unsupported in a standard python docstring.  A separate documentation format or file would be needed to include the image reference.
