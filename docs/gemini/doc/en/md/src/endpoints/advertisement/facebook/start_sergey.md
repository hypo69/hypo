# hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/start_sergey.py

## Overview

This module provides functionality for launching advertisement campaigns on Facebook for various groups, using specified parameters for targeting and language. It leverages external libraries for web driver interaction, file handling, and logging.  The module includes functions for running individual campaigns and managing a campaign cycle, handling different languages and currencies.


## Functions

### `run_campaign`

**Description**:  This function initiates a Facebook advertisement campaign.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the WebDriver for interacting with the Facebook website.  Must be properly configured to handle Facebook login/sessions.
- `promoter_name` (str): The name of the advertiser (e.g., "kazarinov", "aliexpress").
- `campaigns` (list): A list of campaign names to run.
- `group_file_paths` (list): A list of file paths to JSON files containing data about target groups.
- `language` (str): The language of the campaign (e.g., "RU", "HE").
- `currency` (str): The currency used for the campaign (e.g., "ILS").


**Returns**:

- None.  The function directly manages the FacebookPromoter to execute the campaign.


**Raises**:

- Any exceptions raised by `FacebookPromoter.run_campaigns`, including errors related to Facebook API interaction, file reading, or other dependencies.


### `campaign_cycle`

**Description**: This function manages the campaign cycle, executing various advertisement campaigns, potentially for multiple languages and advertisers.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the WebDriver.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the campaign cycle completes successfully.


**Raises**:

- Any exceptions raised during campaign execution (including those caught within the `run_campaign` function).


### `main`

**Description**: The main function for launching advertisement campaigns. It handles the initial setup, runs the campaign cycle, and manages the looping mechanism for continuous campaign execution.

**Parameters**:
- None


**Returns**:
- None

**Raises**:
- `KeyboardInterrupt`: If the user interrupts the program execution.



## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable that likely defines the operational mode for the script.


### `group_file_paths_ru`, `adv_file_paths_ru`, `group_file_paths_he`, `adv_file_paths_he`

**Description**: Lists of file paths to JSON files containing data related to advertisement groups for Russian and Hebrew languages, respectively.


### `group_categories_to_adv`

**Description**: A list of advertisement categories (e.g., ["sales", "biz"]) used for campaign targeting.


### `language_currency_pairs`

**Description**: A list of dictionaries, each containing a language and currency pair. These pairs determine the sequence of languages and currencies for running campaigns in the `campaign_cycle` function.
