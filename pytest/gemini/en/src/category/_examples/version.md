**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly describe the purpose of each test, improving readability.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover the `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__name__` attributes, ensuring that all the declared variables in the provided code are tested.


3. **Edge Cases and Exception Handling:** The `test_version_invalid_input_type` and  `test_version_empty_string` tests demonstrate handling potential errors or invalid data types.  Critically, it now also handles the possibility of empty docstrings or details.

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The tests effectively use `pytest.raises` to catch and validate specific exceptions.

5. **Data Types:**  The tests explicitly check the data type of the attributes.  This ensures the variable types are correct.

6. **Avoid Unnecessary Fixtures:** The code does not require fixtures for these simple tests.


This improved test suite is more robust, covers a wider range of scenarios, and provides better feedback in case of failures.  It also adheres to the requested best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing this test file to execute the tests.
