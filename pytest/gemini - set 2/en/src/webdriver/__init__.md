# IMPORTANT:  Without actual methods in the driver classes, these tests are minimal.
# Add tests for specific methods as you implement them in the driver classes.
# For example, if Driver has a 'start' method:

# def test_driver_start(driver):
#     """Tests the start method of Driver."""
#     driver.start() 
#     # Add assertions to check the status or other properties of the driver.
#     # e.g., assert driver.is_running == True


#  Example of a test for exception handling (if applicable):
# def test_driver_invalid_command(driver):
#     """Test the driver with an invalid command to verify exception handling."""
#     with pytest.raises(Exception) as excinfo:  # Replace Exception with the specific exception
#         driver.invalid_command()
#     assert "Invalid command" in str(excinfo.value)




```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now more accurately reflect their purpose (e.g., `test_driver_creation_invalid_driver`).

2. **Comprehensive Driver Class Tests:** Tests are added for the creation of each driver type (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge`, `BS`, etc.).

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:**  A basic example of exception handling is added (`test_driver_creation_invalid_driver`).  You'll need to adapt this to the actual exceptions raised by your `Driver` class and its methods.

4. **MODE Variable Test:**  A test verifies that the `MODE` variable is correctly assigned.

5. **Missing Method Tests:**  Crucially, the provided code doesn't define any methods on the `Driver` class or the other classes.  The example `test_driver_start` (commented out) demonStartes how to test methods *when they exist.*  You *must* add tests for actual methods and functionality within each class.

6. **Fixtures:**  No fixtures are needed in this example, but you will need them if you have setup/teardown required for your driver instantiation, or if the `Driver` class relies on external data.


**How to Use and Adapt:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Uncomment the `test_driver_start` and `test_driver_invalid_command` examples and adapt the assertions to check the specific return values, attributes, or behaviors of your driver classes.

2. **Add tests for methods:** Add tests for `start`, `stop`, `get`, etc., and incorporate the appropriate assertions to verify the expected behaviors of those methods.

3. **Add exception tests:**  If your driver code raises specific exceptions (e.g., `InvalidURL` exception), use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.

4. **Add more complex scenarios:** Consider edge cases, boundary conditions, and invalid inputs for each function/method.


This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive test suite that will evolve with the functionality of your driver classes. Remember to thoroughly test all the methods in your `webdriver` module. Remember to replace placeholder comments with your actual tests. Remember to run `pytest` in your terminal to execute these tests.
