```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  Therefore,
# no tests can be written.  The HTML file is just an HTML page
# that displays some text.  There are no functions or methods
# to test.


# Since there's no Python code, this file is essentially empty
# and no tests are needed.
