**Documentation (Markdown):**

```markdown
# hypotez/src/utils/version.py

This file contains version information for the `hypotez` project.

## Module: `src.utils`

This module, `version.py`, defines several variables containing metadata about the project:

* **`__version__`:**  The current version string of the `hypotez` project (e.g., `v1.1`).
* **`__doc__`:**  An empty string (likely intended to hold module documentation).
* **`__details__`:** An empty string (likely intended for additional details about the module).
* **`__author__`:**  The author of the project (`hypo69`).
* **`__copyright__`:**  The copyright information and licensing details, including a link to the MIT License.  Crucially, it prohibits commercial use without permission.
* **`__cofee__`:** A link for donating to the developer (treating them to coffee) to incentivize further development.

**Example Usage (if the file was imported):**

```python
import hypotez.src.utils.version

print(hypotez.src.utils.version.__version__)  # Output: v1.1
print(hypotez.src.utils.version.__author__)   # Output: hypo69
print(hypotez.src.utils.version.__copyright__) # Output: (The copyright text)
```

**Important Notes:**

* This file is intended for use within a larger Python project.
* The `__doc__` and `__details__` variables are currently empty. Consider filling these with more descriptive text to improve understanding of the module's purpose and functionality.
* The `__copyright__` statement is crucial for legal compliance.  Make sure the MIT license details are correct and accurately reflect the terms of the project's license.
* The `__cofee__` link is a good example of promoting open source development through community support.
