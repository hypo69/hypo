**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Removed Unnecessary Variable:** The `__root__` variable inside the function was redundant.  The function already returns the calculated `project_root`.  This change simplifies the code.


2. **Optimized the Loop:** The previous code checked all marker files for *every* parent directory.  The new code checks for a marker in each parent only *once*.  If a marker is found, the loop immediately breaks to the next parent, significantly improving efficiency.  This is crucial, especially if there are many marker files, because it avoids unnecessary iterations.


3. **Corrected Variable Assignment:** The assignment `__root__ = current_path` was done inside the loop, but this was incorrect.  The `project_root` was initialized outside, then assigned a new value within the loop.

4. **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names (`project_root`) for better understanding.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Performance:** The original code had a nested loop which would iterate unnecessarily. The new code drastically improves performance, especially if the project is deep in the directory hierarchy and the marker file is not the first file in the list.

* **Correctness:** The original code could potentially return an incorrect project root if a marker was found in a deeply nested directory and the wrong marker file was used. The updated code is correctly assigning the project root and ensuring the loop stops at the first match.

* **Readability:** The code is now more concise and easier to follow.

This revised code is more efficient, correct, and readable. It's a significantly better solution for finding the project root. Remember to use `__root__` (or a more descriptive name) after the function call to get the returned value.


**Example usage (assuming `pyproject.toml` exists in the project root):**

```python
# In another file, after importing header
project_root = get_project_root()
print(project_root)
```
