**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_root_path_calculation`:** This test now directly checks if the calculated root path matches the expected path.  Crucially, it uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current directory, which is essential for accurate testing.  This test will only pass if 'hypotez' exists in the cwd.
2. **`test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`:** This new test demonStartes how to handle cases where 'hypotez' might not be present in the current working directory.  It uses `os.chdir()` to temporarily change the current directory, and the fixture approach to modify variables for a more realistic test scenario. This is vital because the code will fail if 'hypotez' is not found, but this wasn't addressed. It also includes a `finally` block to restore the original directory, preventing unexpected side effects in the test suite. This test case is very important for robust testing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Mocking:** The code modifies `sys.path`. To properly test this, you'd need to mock (using a library like `unittest.mock` or the pytest `monkeypatch`) the behavior of `sys.path.append`. This would isolate the test from external dependencies. This is why the tests are mostly focused on the path calculation itself.
* **Test Environment:** Consider using a temporary directory (`tempfile`) for the tests so you avoid modifying the user's actual directory.
* **Context:**  Provide the actual Python code (functions, classes) you want to test so these tests can be made fully relevant.


**To Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as the Python code you want to test.
2. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the path calculation logic. Remember to replace placeholders with the actual code you want to test, and use mocking to handle dependencies like `sys.path`. Remember to fix the file path of `__root__` to be more reliable as well.
