**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`_clean` function improvement:** Added crucial `if content is None:` check.  This prevents a `TypeError` if `xpath` returns `None`.  Also forced `content` to be a string with `str(content)`.  This was a major source of potential errors.

* **`get_data` function improvement:** Added a `elif` block for the `mobile` user agent. This is important if you're expecting different structures in the mobile version of Google Search results. The example shows how to add mobile-specific parsing (if applicable).

* **Variable name correction:** Changed `StringNormalizerippet` to `featured_snippet` in the `get_data` function. This reflects the intended use of the code.  A `featured_snippet` is a different section than the more generic `StringNormalizerippet`.

* **`_clean` function minor improvements:** Removed the potentially problematic UTF-8 encoding/decoding, as it doesn't apply here for the task of string cleaning.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Consider adding more robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) within the `_get_*` methods in case of unexpected data formats or missing elements.


* **Mobile Parsing:** If you need to parse the mobile version of Google Search results, you must add methods to get the relevant data (like `self._get_mobile_organic()`). The mobile structure can vary significantly from the desktop version.


* **Data Validation:**  Add checks in the `_get_*` methods to ensure that the extracted data has the expected format.  For instance, if an element is expected to be a string, ensure that the extracted value is indeed a string.


By addressing these points, you can make the code more robust and applicable to various scenarios. Remember to adapt the `_get_*` methods and the `elif` block for `mobile` results parsing in `get_data` to your specific needs.
