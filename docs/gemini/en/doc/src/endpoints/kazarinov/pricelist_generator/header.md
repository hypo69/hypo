# hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/scenarios/header.py

## Overview

This module defines functions for finding the project root directory and loading settings from a JSON file. It also handles potential errors during file reading.  It defines variables for project name, version, documentation, details, author, copyright, and a link to support the developer.


## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project by searching upward from the current file's directory until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): A tuple of filenames or directory names to identify the project root.  Defaults to a tuple containing `'pyproject.toml'`, `'requirements.txt'`, and `'.git'`.

**Returns**:

- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.

**Raises**:

- None


### `set_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory, searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root (default: `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`).

**Returns**:

- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found; otherwise, the directory of the script.


## Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**: Holds the path to the project root directory, obtained from calling `set_project_root()`.

**Type**: `Path`


## Loading Settings

**Description**: This section describes the code for loading settings from a JSON file named `settings.json` located in the `src` directory.  If the file does not exist, or if it is not valid JSON, appropriate exception handling is included.

**Variables**:

- `settings`: A dictionary containing the project settings.


## Loading Documentation

**Description**:  This section describes the code for loading documentation from a file named `README.MD` located in the `src` directory.  If the file does not exist or cannot be parsed, exception handling is implemented.


**Variables**:

- `doc_str`: A string containing the project documentation, if found in the `README.MD` file.


## Project Information Variables

**Description**:  These variables store project information loaded from the `settings.json` file, providing defaults if the file is missing or the key is not found.

**Variables**:

- `__project_name__`: Name of the project. Defaults to `hypotez`.
- `__version__`: Version of the project. Defaults to an empty string.
- `__doc__`: Project documentation string. Defaults to an empty string.
- `__details__`: Additional details. Defaults to an empty string.
- `__author__`: Author of the project. Defaults to an empty string.
- `__copyright__`: Copyright information. Defaults to an empty string.
- `__cofee__`: Link to support the project via a coffee donation. Defaults to a specific link.
