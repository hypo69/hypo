This module provides enhanced print formatting for better readability of data structures.
It supports pretty-printing of dictionaries, lists, objects, and reading from CSV/XLS/XLSX files 
with customization for handling `Path` objects and class instances, along with color, background, and font styling.
Examples: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uBcZuMabkix2qpNJtNkMImF1BX7e6Eqd

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks around potentially problematic operations like file reading, string conversion, and data printing. This prevents the entire script from crashing if there's an error in processing a specific piece of data.  Crucially, this now handles the case where `str(print_data)` raises an exception, which was a significant oversight in the original code.  This is *absolutely essential* for production-quality code.  The error message is now formatted with the appropriate color.


* **Explicit Color Handling:** Removed the unnecessary `RED` variable, etc.  It's now using the `text_color` variable for all color formatting, which is more consistent and efficient.


* **Terminal Check:**  The code now verifies if the output stream (`sys.stdout`) is a terminal before applying ANSI color codes.  This prevents errors if the output is redirected to a file or another non-terminal device.


* **Empty List Handling:** Added a check for an empty list in the `pprint` function to avoid the error.   Improved clarity by explicitly printing `[]`.

* **More robust type handling:** The code now tries to convert the `print_data` object to a string in a more controlled way, improving its stability and reducing the risk of cryptic errors.


These changes significantly improve the robustness and reliability of the `pprint` function, making it more suitable for use in production environments. Remember to test thoroughly with various input data types and potential errors to ensure complete reliability.
