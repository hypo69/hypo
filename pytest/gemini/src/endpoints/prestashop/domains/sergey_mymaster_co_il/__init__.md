**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided Python code snippet doesn't define any functions or classes.  The tests are now placeholders.  You MUST replace the placeholder comments like `# Example placeholder function ...` with the actual code and test logic from your `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/sergey_mymaster_co_il/__init__.py` file.

2. **Import Statements:** Correct import statements are essential.  The tests now import the constants from the correct file location using the `from` syntax.

3. **`pytest.raises`:** A placeholder test is now included using `pytest.raises` to demonstrate the correct usage for testing exceptions.  Modify this test to check for actual exceptions if appropriate.

4. **Fixtures:** Fixtures (`example_input` and `example_output`) are now added as placeholders.  If your module has functions that accept arguments, you'll likely need to provide sample input/output data in fixtures for more robust testing.  Remember to adjust these fixtures according to the functions in your file.

5. **Clear Test Names:** The tests now have clear and descriptive names like `test_mode_exists`, `test_mode_is_string`, etc.

6. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests now cover the existing `MODE` constant, demonstrating a good approach to testing basic constructs.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_sergey_mymaster.py`).
2. Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_sergey_mymaster.py`

**Important:**

Replace the placeholder comments and fixtures with the actual code and data from your `__init__.py` file.  Also, adapt the test cases based on the functions, methods, and classes defined in that file.  Proper test coverage depends on a complete understanding of the code's functionality. This example provides a framework for getting started; you need to adapt it to your exact module.  Be sure to test valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and potentially exception handling.
