## <algorithm>

1. **Import necessary modules:** Imports `os`, `nbformat`, `ExecutePreprocessor`, `pytest`, `sys`.  These modules provide file system operations, Jupyter notebook reading/writing, executing notebooks, testing frameworks and path manipulation, respectively.
2. **Set paths:** Modifies the Python path `sys.path` to ensure it can find the `tinytroupe` package in the project's source directory.
3. **Define constants:** `NOTEBOOK_FOLDER`, `TIMEOUT`, and `KERNEL_NAME` are defined to control notebook execution settings.
4. **`get_notebooks` function:** This function takes a folder path and returns a list of Jupyter notebook files within that folder that haven't already been executed. It filters files to avoid processing previously executed files.
5. **`test_notebook_execution` function (pytest test):** 
    * Takes a `notebook_path` as input, obtained from `get_notebooks`.
    * Reads the Jupyter notebook (`notebook`) from the file.
    * Creates an `ExecutePreprocessor` instance, defining the timeout and kernel name.
    * **`try...except...finally` block:** Attempts to execute the notebook using `ep.preprocess`. 
        * Prints success message if executed without errors.
        * If an exception occurs, it prints the exception and uses `pytest.fail` to mark the test as failed.
        * **Finally block:** Creates a backup copy of the executed notebook, appending ".executed.local" to the original file name.

**Dependencies:**

* `os`:  Provides interacting with the operating system, like file system operations.
* `nbformat`:  Handles reading and writing Jupyter notebook files.
* `nbconvert.preprocessors`: Provides the `ExecutePreprocessor` class for executing notebooks.
* `pytest`: The testing framework.
* `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, including the Python path (`sys.path`).


## <explanation>

* **Imports**:
    * `os`: Used for file system operations like getting notebook files and creating backup files.
    * `nbformat`: Used for reading and writing Jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`).
    * `ExecutePreprocessor`: From `nbconvert`, used to execute the Jupyter notebooks.
    * `pytest`: Used for testing the execution of the notebooks.
    * `sys`: Used to modify the Python path, ensuring the `tinytroupe` package can be found.
* **Classes:**
    * `ExecutePreprocessor`: Takes care of executing the notebook.  The `timeout` argument controls how long the execution can run before timing out. `kernel_name` specifies the kernel to use (e.g., Python 3 in this case).
* **Functions:**
    * `get_notebooks(folder)`:  This function is crucial for selecting notebooks to be tested.  It filters notebooks to avoid those that have already been run (by checking for ".executed." and ".local." in filenames). This is important for preventing redundant work and keeping test data consistent.
    * `test_notebook_execution(notebook_path)`: The core test function.  It opens the notebook, creates an `ExecutePreprocessor` object, attempts to execute the notebook, handles exceptions, and then saves a copy of the executed notebook for later analysis or review.
* **Variables:**
    * `NOTEBOOK_FOLDER`: Specifies the folder where Jupyter notebooks are located.
    * `TIMEOUT`: The maximum time allowed for notebook execution.
    * `KERNEL_NAME`: Specifies the kernel to use for execution, allowing for different runtime environments.
* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**
    * The code assumes the notebooks are in a specific folder (`../examples/`).  Make sure this is correct.
    * The `sys.path.insert` statements are used to add locations to the Python path, enabling modules to be found. These statements could be improved by using a more structured way of managing package locations. The use of `../../tinytroupe/` and `../../` implies a specific directory structure. The code might fail if the project's structure changes.
    * Handling cases where the notebook has issues is needed for more robustness.  The `try...except` block is good, but consider specific error handling (e.g., syntax errors in the notebook).  Logging the errors would be helpful for debugging.
    * Consider using a more descriptive naming scheme for the executed notebook backup (e.g., timestamp or unique identifier).


**Relationship Chain:**

This code likely belongs to a testing suite for the `tinytroupe` package.  The tests check that Jupyter notebooks, which might contain examples or documentation, run without errors.  The executed notebooks are saved so the results can be verified or examined.
