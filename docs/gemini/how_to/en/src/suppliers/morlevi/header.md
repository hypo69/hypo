```
This Python script, `header.py`, sets up the project environment and gathers metadata about the project.  It's designed to be included at the top of other Python files within the `hypotez` project.

**How to use it:**

1. **Project Structure:**  The script assumes a project structure like this:

```
hypotez/
├── src/
│   ├── suppliers/
│   │   └── morlevi/
│   │       └── header.py
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── README.MD
│   └── ...other files/modules...
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
└── .git
```

2. **`header.py` explanation:**

   - **`set_project_root()`:** This function is crucial. It dynamically finds the root directory of the `hypotez` project.  It searches upward from the current file's location looking for specific marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  This is important for absolute pathing within the project, and for correctly adding the project root to `sys.path`.  If the root isn't found, it defaults to the directory of the script itself.

   - **`__root__` Variable:** This variable stores the project root directory, which is critical for accessing files like `settings.json` and `README.MD` located in the `src` directory.

   - **Metadata Loading:** The script attempts to load project settings from `src/settings.json` into the `settings` dictionary.  It gracefully handles cases where `settings.json` is missing or corrupted (using `try...except` blocks).

   - **Documentation Loading:** Similarly, it tries to load the project's documentation from `src/README.MD`.  Any errors are handled.

   - **Metadata Extraction:**  It then extracts specific project metadata (like `project_name`, `version`, `author`, etc.) from the loaded `settings` dictionary.  If `settings.json` isn't found, or a key is missing, default values are used.

   - **Global Variables:** The extracted metadata is stored as global variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc.) within the `header.py` scope, making them accessible to other modules in the `hypotez` project.

3. **Import `gs`:** The script imports a `gs` module. This module is likely another part of the `hypotez` project that provides paths (`gs.path.root`).  It's vital to ensure the `gs` module is in place for this part of the code to work.

4. **Usage in other modules:**  Any Python module in the `hypotez` project can now import `header.py` to access the project metadata:

```python
import hypotez.src.suppliers.morlevi.header as header

print(header.__project_name__)
print(header.__version__)
```

**Error Handling and Robustness:**

- The `try...except` blocks are crucial. They prevent the script from crashing if `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing or improperly formatted.


**Key Improvements:**

- **Clarity:** The comments explain the purpose of each section.
- **Structure:** The code is broken down into logical blocks.
- **Robustness:**  Handles missing or invalid files/JSON.
- **Documentation:** Explains the expected project structure and how to use the metadata.


**Further Considerations:**

- **External Libraries:** Make sure the `packaging` library is installed (`pip install packaging`).
- **Testing:** Write tests to verify that `set_project_root` correctly locates the project root and that the metadata loading works as expected.
- **`gs` Module:** Understanding the `gs` module (especially its `path` attribute) is crucial for complete comprehension and further development.
- **Version Control:** Always use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track your code changes.
