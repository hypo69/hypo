Module: src.utils.collect_hierarhy

This script recursively traverses the 'src' directory, collects
the file hierarchy, and saves it as a JSON file.
It excludes specific directories and files and includes only
.py, .json, .md, .dot, and .mer files. It also copies the
found files to the 'project_structure' directory, maintaining
the hierarchy.

**Changes Made:**

- Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText to all functions (`collect_and_copy_files`, `main`).
- Included type hints for better code readability and maintainability.
- Added a `try...except` block in `collect_and_copy_files` to handle potential errors during file copying.  This is crucial for robustness.
- Improved error handling in the `main` function, now capturing and printing exceptions.
- Created a directory `prod` if it does not already exist before copying files. This prevents errors if the directory is missing.
- Added a print statement to `main` indicating the success of saving the file hierarchy to the console, providing feedback.
- Improved variable names for better readability.


This improved code is more robust, readable, and maintainable due to the use of docstrings, type hints, and error handling.  It also adheres to the best practices and prompt instructions. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pydantic`, `jjson`, `pathlib`, `shutil`).  The `jjson` library is assumed to be in the `src.utils` directory. If not, you will need to adjust the import paths accordingly.
