**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`@pytest.fixture` for driver:**  Crucially, a `driver` fixture is added. This is essential for WebDriver tests.  The fixture now creates and quits the browser for each test, ensuring isolation.  Importantly, it now runs in headless mode, which is more efficient for automated testing.

2. **`test_borderify_sets_border`:** This test now handles potential timeouts using `WebDriverWait`.  It waits for the `body` element to be present before checking the style, which is vital to ensure the script has actually executed.  Error handling is also improved.

3. **`test_alert_appears`:** This test specifically handles the `alert()` call, waiting for the alert to appear before interacting with it. This ensures the alert is handled correctly. Again, error handling is added for robustness.

4. **Error Handling:** The tests now include `try...except` blocks to catch and report any exceptions during the test execution. This provides more informative error messages if something goes wrong.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of the test.

6. **About:blank Page:**  The tests now use `driver.get("about:blank")` to ensure tests are not affected by any pre-existing page styles.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_borderify.py
   ```

This revised solution is more robust and reliable for testing the JavaScript code in the context of a Selenium WebDriver. Remember to replace `"test_borderify.py"` with the actual name of your test file if different.  Make sure to install the `geckodriver` for Firefox.
