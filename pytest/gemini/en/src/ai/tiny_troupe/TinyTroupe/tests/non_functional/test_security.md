```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `openai_utils`:** The code now uses a `MockOpenAIClient` to isolate the tests from the actual `openai` library. This is crucial for testing the function's logic without depending on an external API.  This significantly improves testability.

2. **Comprehensive Parameterization:** The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to test with different messages, ensuring more diverse input.

3. **Edge Case Testing:**  The tests now explicitly check for empty responses (`content` and `role` are empty strings) and very large responses (which could cause issues).  It also checks for non-UTF-8 characters in the response which is critical for security.

4. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is correctly used to assert that exceptions are raised for invalid responses, like non-UTF-8 strings or overly long responses.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** The error messages in the assertions are more descriptive, making debugging easier.

6. **Mock Logging:** I've added a `MockLogger` to address the unused `logging` part, but in practice if you want to track logging messages in tests, you might want to use the `caplog` fixture from pytest.

7. **`create_test_system_user_message`:** I added this function to ensure consistency in creating test messages.

8. **Removed Unnecessary Code:** Removed the unnecessary `print` statements, improving test readability.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as `test_security.py` (or a similar name).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_security.py`


This revised solution is far more robust and comprehensive in testing the security-relevant aspects of the function. Remember to replace the placeholder imports (`from testing_utils import *`) with the actual imports if they exist in your project.  Testing the `create_test_system_user_message` function would be important too.
