**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Version Tests:**  The tests now thoroughly check `__version__` including type checking and ensuring it's not an empty string, making them more robust.

2. **Docstring Tests:** The tests for `__doc__` now verify that it's a string and not empty.

3. **Details Tests:** The tests for `__details__` check for its type (making the test more flexible if `__details__` is a list or tuple) and ensure it's not empty. This is crucial as the actual type of `__details__` is not specified in the original code.

4. **MODE Tests:** The tests for `MODE` are improved with the `in` operator to check for valid values (e.g., `'dev'`, `'prod'`, or `'test'`) in a more flexible way.  If `MODE` could take other values, modify this accordingly.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Using more descriptive assertions makes the failure messages more helpful during testing.

6. **Handles potential data types:** The tests now check for more possible data types for `__details__` if the actual structure is a list or a tuple (instead of just a dictionary).  This is crucial for robustness.

7. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to explain the purpose of each test function. This is important for maintaining the test suite.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_openai_examples.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_openai_examples.py`

This improved test suite provides more confidence in the correctness of the `__init__.py` code, including edge cases for version and details. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual expected types and values in your code.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Code:** The provided `__init__.py` file is incomplete. It has placeholders for `MODE`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`, but their actual implementations are not shown. The tests have been written assuming those are initialized and populated in a standard way, but you need to modify them based on the actual implementations.
* **Actual Types:**  The test suite will fail if the types of `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` are not what is expected. Ensure the tests correctly reflect the structure of the data.
* **Data Validation:** Depending on the code, you may need additional tests to validate the content or values of these attributes (e.g., if there are expected formats or constraints).
