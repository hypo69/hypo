How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet defines a function `set_project_root` that locates the root directory of a project.  It then initializes variables related to project metadata, such as name, version, documentation, author, and copyright information, by reading data from `settings.json` and `README.MD` files within the project's source directory.  If these files are not found, it defaults to specified values.  Finally, it ensures the project root directory is added to the Python path.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports modules like `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging`, and `Path` from `pathlib`, which are required for its operation.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes an optional argument `marker_files` to specify the files or directories used to identify the project's root directory.

3. **Locate project root:** The code starts by finding the current file's directory and iterates upward through its parent directories until it finds a directory containing any of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`).

4. **Add project root to sys.path:** If the project root is not already in the `sys.path` list, it's added to the beginning of the list to allow import of modules from the project's source directory.

5. **Return project root:** The function returns the path to the located project root directory.

6. **Set project metadata:** The code calls `set_project_root()` to get the project root and then reads settings from `settings.json`.

7. **Handle potential errors:** Error handling (using `try...except` blocks) is implemented for both file reading and JSON decoding to gracefully handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` files might not exist or contain invalid data.  If an error occurs, the related variable defaults to an appropriate value.

8. **Store project metadata:**  Variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__` are initialized with values from `settings.json` (if available) or default values.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.wallmart.header import set_project_root
    
    # Example usage (assuming the project structure is set up correctly):
    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}") # Accessing the variable defined in header.py
