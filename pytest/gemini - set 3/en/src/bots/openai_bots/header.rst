```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added fixtures (`mock_settings_json`, `mock_settings_file`, `dummy_project_path`) to create mock data and project structures, making tests more isolated and reusable.  Crucially, `mock_settings_file` is used to *create* the file, ensuring the file exists and having the correct path.

2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now more precisely describe the scenario being tested.

3. **Exception Handling:** Included `pytest.raises` for exception testing (`FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) to verify correct handling of invalid or missing files.   Crucially, added tests for the `FileNotFoundError` case for the `settings` loading.

4. **Valid Input Tests:** Added `test_set_project_root_valid_input` to verify correct functionality with valid input data.

5. **Invalid Input Tests:** Added `test_set_project_root_invalid_input` to demonStarte handling of incorrect marker files.

6. **No Marker Files Test:** Added `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` to test the edge case where no marker files are provided, which should return the current directory.

7. **File Not Found Test:** Added `test_set_project_root_file_not_found` to test the case where marker files aren't found.

8. **Mock Files:** The fixtures now *create* the necessary mock files (settings.json, README.md), which is crucial for testing.

9. **`__file__` Argument:** Added the `__file__` argument to the `set_project_root` function to allow the testing function to call the function with the file path of a test file (important for testing purposes).


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution provides more comprehensive and robust test cases for the `header.py` file, covering various scenarios and ensuring that the project root is correctly determined and settings are loaded appropriately.  It also addresses the critical issue of properly testing `FileNotFoundError` scenarios. Remember to place `test_header.py` in a directory that can be accessed from your import statements.
