How to use the `yeld_conversations_htmls` method in the `ChatGpt` class

This method, part of the `chat_gpt.py` file, aims to retrieve HTML files containing chat conversations.  Here's a breakdown of how to use it:

**1. Importing the necessary modules:**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from src import gs
from src.utils.file import recursively_read_text_files
from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt.chat_gpt import ChatGpt
```

This imports the necessary classes and modules, ensuring you have access to the `ChatGpt` class and its associated functions.  Crucially, it includes `recursively_read_text_files` (though its exact purpose in the code snippet remains unclear given the incomplete method) and `gs`, a likely placeholder for a global settings or configuration object.  **Replace placeholder imports (`src`) with the actual import paths from your project.**

**2. Instantiating the `ChatGpt` class:**

```python
chat_gpt_instance = ChatGpt()
```

This creates an object of the `ChatGpt` class, allowing you to call its methods.

**3. Calling the `yeld_conversations_htmls` method:**

```python
html_content = chat_gpt_instance.yeld_conversations_htmls()
```

This is where the actual retrieval takes place.  The method presumably returns a string containing the gathered HTML content (though the `yeld_conversations_htmls` name suggests an iterable or generator; the actual return type depends on the implementation.)

**4. Handling the returned value:**

- **String return (if the function returns a string):** If the function returns a single string containing all the HTML, you can process it further:
  ```python
  # Example processing if it returns a string
  print(html_content)  # Print the HTML
  # You might want to parse it using Beautiful Soup or similar libraries:
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
  # Process the parsed HTML content here
  ```


- **Iterable/Generator return (if the function returns an iterable or generator):** If the function yields multiple HTML files (or portions of an HTML file), you'll need to iterate:
  ```python
  # Example processing if it's an iterable
  for html_file in chat_gpt_instance.yeld_conversations_htmls():
      print(html_file)  # Print each HTML file separately
      # Or process each HTML individually with Beautiful Soup etc.

  ```

**Crucial Considerations and Missing Information:**

* **`gs.path.data`:** The code uses `gs.path.data / 'chat_gpt' / 'conversations'`. This assumes `gs` provides access to a path object or similar.  You need to understand how `gs` works in your project.
* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling (e.g., checking if the directory or files exist).  You should include `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors like `FileNotFoundError`.
* **File format handling:**  The docstring mentions HTML files. You need to specify how the output should be handled, depending if you want to read all HTML or process it individually.
* **Implementation Details:** The `yeld_conversations_htmls` method is incomplete.  You'll need to understand the full implementation to know exactly what data it's intended to return.

**Example with error handling:**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from src import gs
from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt.chat_gpt import ChatGpt

try:
    chat_gpt_instance = ChatGpt()
    html_content = chat_gpt_instance.yeld_conversations_htmls()
    # Process the returned content as described above.
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
