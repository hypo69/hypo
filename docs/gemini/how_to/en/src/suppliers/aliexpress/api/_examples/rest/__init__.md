This Python file (`hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/_examples/rest/__init__.py`) serves as a module containing imports for various requests related to the AliExpress API.  It's likely part of a larger project focused on interacting with the AliExpress API through a RESTful interface.

**Usage Guide:**

This file *doesn't* contain executable code itself.  It's an *import module*.  To use the requests defined within, you would import specific classes from within this file into your main program.

**How to use:**

1. **Import the necessary request classes:**

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest import (
       AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest,
       AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest,
       # ... and so on for all the other requests
   )
   ```

2. **Instantiate an object of the desired request class:**

   Each of the classes (e.g., `AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest`) likely represents a specific type of request to the AliExpress API. You'll need to populate the required parameters for that request.  A common pattern involves instantiating these with necessary data:

   ```python
   # Example:
   params = {
       "keyword": "example keyword",
       "country": "US",
       # ... other parameters
   }

   request_object = AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest(**params)
   ```

3. **Send the request (likely using a client):**

   Crucially, this file likely *doesn't* handle the actual sending of the request.  Instead, your project will need a client library (probably a third-party one like `requests`) to send these requests and handle HTTP interaction:


   ```python
   # Example, assuming a 'client' object is available for handling requests:
   response = client.send(request_object)
   ```

4. **Process the response:**

   Examine the `response` object (returned by the client) to access the results returned by the AliExpress API.  The `response` will likely contain status codes, headers, and the actual data in a structured format (JSON or similar).  **This is critical**: the precise structure of the response is *absolutely critical* for handling it correctly.

**Key points for understanding the file:**

* **Purpose:** This file organizes and provides access to different AliExpress API request types.
* **Abstraction:** It encapsulates the details of specific requests into reusable classes.
* **Relationship to main program:** This module is meant to be imported and used *within* another script. Your main program will likely be responsible for orchestrating the interactions using the classes in this file.
* **External dependencies:** Your project needs a library (likely `requests`) to send the HTTP requests to the API.

**Example of a potential `main.py` or similar file using these classes (conceptual):**

```python
import requests
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest import AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest

# ... (code to initialize requests client)

client = requests.Session()  # Example; a real client might have more configuration
params = {"keyword": "example keyword", "country": "US"}

request_object = AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest(**params)
response = client.post(request_object.endpoint, json=request_object.data)

# Check for errors and extract data from the response.json
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # ... process the 'data' according to the structure returned by AliExpress
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

Remember to replace the example code with the actual logic required by your application.  Inspect the documentation or code of `AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest` (and other classes) for details on its structure and parameter requirements.
