# <algorithm>

**Algorithm for `spinning_cursor`:**

1. Enters an infinite `while` loop.
2. Iterates through the characters `'|', '/', '-', '\\'`.
3. Yields each character.

**Example for `spinning_cursor`:**

```
Input: None
Output: '|', '/', '-', '\\', '|', ...
```

**Algorithm for `show_spinner`:**

1. Creates a `spinner` generator object using `spinning_cursor()`.
2. Calculates the `end_time` based on the `duration` and current time.
3. Enters a `while` loop that continues until the current time reaches `end_time`.
4. Prints the next character from the `spinner` using `next(spinner)`.
5. `sys.stdout.flush()` immediately displays the printed character.
6. `time.sleep(delay)` pauses for the specified delay.
7. `sys.stdout.write('\b')` moves the cursor back one position, allowing the spinner character to be overwritten in the next iteration.

**Example for `show_spinner`:**

```
Input: duration=3.0, delay=0.2
Output: Shows a spinning cursor for 3 seconds, cycling through '|', '/', '-', '\\' characters, each with a delay of 0.2 seconds.
```

```

**Dependencies Analysis:**

The `mermaid` diagram illuStartes the flow from the `main` execution to the `spinning_cursor` function, which is then consumed by the `show_spinner` function.  Crucially, it shows how the `time` and `sys` modules are used within this process.  `time` provides functions for controlling time-related operations, and `sys` provides access to system-specific parameters or functions, including `stdout` for console output.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

* **`time`:** Used for pausing execution and managing time delays in `show_spinner`.  It's a standard Python module for time-related operations and is part of the Python standard library.  Its usage is integral to creating the spinning cursor effect.
* **`sys`:** Used for interacting with the standard input/output streams, specifically `sys.stdout` for writing to the console. This is a crucial part for showing the output in the terminal and an integral part of the spinner functionality. Also part of the Python standard library.

**Classes:**

* No classes are defined in this module.

**Functions:**

* **`spinning_cursor()`:**
    * Arguments: None
    * Return value: A generator that yields characters in a sequence ('|', '/', '-', '\').
    * Purpose: Creates a generator to produce the characters for the spinner. The `while True` loop makes it an infinite generator, which is well-suited to the task of displaying a continuous spinning cursor.  `for cursor in '|/-\\'`: iterates through the symbols, yielding each one.
* **`show_spinner()`:**
    * Arguments:
        * `duration` (float): How long the spinner should run (in seconds). Defaults to 5.0.
        * `delay` (float): Delay between each spin (in seconds). Defaults to 0.1.
    * Return value: None (it prints to the console).
    * Purpose: This function displays the spinning cursor for a specified duration.
        * `spinner = spinning_cursor()`: It instantiates a `spinning_cursor` generator object.
        * `end_time = time.time() + duration`: Calculates the end time based on the current time and the specified duration.
        * `while time.time() < end_time`: Loops to display the spinner until the end time is reached.
        * `sys.stdout.write(next(spinner))`: Displays the next character from the generator.
        * `sys.stdout.flush()`: Ensures immediate output to the console.
        * `time.sleep(delay)`: Pauses execution for a given delay.
        * `sys.stdout.write('\b')`: Moves the cursor back to overwrite the previous character for smooth rotation.

**Variables:**

* **`MODE`**: String variable set to 'dev'.  Its purpose isn't apparent from this code snippet alone. Further context or other files in the project are needed to understand its meaning.

**Potential Errors or Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  No error handling is included. If there's a problem with `time` or `sys` operations, the program will likely crash without proper error handling.
* **User Input:** The spinner continues regardless of user input.  For interactive applications, the spinner should be responsive to user actions.

**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

The `utils` module, and specifically `cursor_spinner.py` likely serves a utility function to other parts of the `hypotez` project. These utility functions help to perform tasks like displaying loading indicators or progress updates in the application.  It's expected that the `hypotez` project would use this spinner in tasks that require simulating progress.
