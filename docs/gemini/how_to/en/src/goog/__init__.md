## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/goog/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/goog/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for the `goog` package.  It primarily sets a global mode variable and imports a class (`Spreadsheet`) from a submodule.


### Contents

* **`MODE = 'dev'`**:  This line defines a global variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value `'dev'` to it.  This variable likely controls the behavior of the `goog` package, potentially differentiating between development and production modes.

* **`from .spreadsheet import SpreadSheet`**: This line imports the `Spreadsheet` class from the `spreadsheet.py` file within the `goog` subpackage.  This makes the `Spreadsheet` class available for use in other parts of your application.


### How to use

To utilize the `Spreadsheet` class, you first need to import it from the `goog` package:


```python
from hypotez.src.goog import SpreadSheet

# Now you can create a Spreadsheet object
spreadsheet_instance = SpreadSheet()

# ... perform operations on the spreadsheet object, such as:
# spreadsheet_instance.load_data(...)
# spreadsheet_instance.save_data(...)
# spreadsheet_instance.analyze(...)

```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet.py`**: The code example only shows the initialization file.  The actual functionality of the `SpreadSheet` class is defined in the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet.py` module.  You will need to consult its documentation to understand how to interact with the `Spreadsheet` object.

* **Mode ('dev')**:  Be aware of the `MODE = 'dev'` variable.  How the `goog` package behaves in `dev` mode might differ from production mode, and there may be associated dependencies (configurations, external libraries, data sources) to be considered.

* **Shebang Lines:** The `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12` lines are shebang lines, indicating the interpreter to use. These lines are particularly important in scripts intended to be run directly from the command line. They will not be directly used when importing this module within a larger project.  They are typically used when creating executable scripts, so they are relevant to running the script directly.


This guide provides a basic understanding.  Detailed instructions for using the `Spreadsheet` class and the `MODE` variable would need the contents of `spreadsheet.py` and its accompanying documentation.
