How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet imports a module named `Mexiron` from the `scenario_pricelist` submodule within the `kazarinov` folder.  It also defines a variable `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'. This suggests that the code is likely part of a larger application that manages various operation modes (e.g., development, production).  The core action is to import the necessary module for interacting with the scenario price list.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The script sets the `MODE` variable to the string value 'dev'. This likely configures the application to use development mode parameters.

2. It imports the `Mexiron` class from the `scenario_pricelist.py` file located within the `kazarinov/scenarios` directory. This module presumably handles price list scenarios.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have the necessary imports and setup
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.scenarios import Mexiron
    
    # Accessing the Mexiron class.  Replace with appropriate usage.
    mexiron_instance = Mexiron() 
    # Example of using the class
    # ... (Add your methods, functions, calls using the Mexiron class here) ...
    
    # Example showing how Mexiron interacts with other parts of the application.
    # ... (Add example of other functions or objects interacting with mexiron_instance) ...
    print(f"Current mode: {MODE}")

**Important Considerations:**

* The provided code snippet is very basic.  To fully understand how to use `Mexiron`, you need the implementation details of the `Mexiron` class itself (which is not included).
* The `MODE` variable likely plays a role in configuring how the application interacts with the data, perhaps selecting different datasets or performing different calculations based on whether it's in development or production.
* The comment suggests that this is part of a larger project with other related modules.  To utilize this properly, you would need the context of the complete project structure and the functions or methods available within `scenario_pricelist` and `Mexiron`.
