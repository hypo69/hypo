# hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/training.py

This module provides the `OpenAIModel` class for interacting with the OpenAI API and managing model training.  It handles sending messages, processing responses, performing sentiment analysis, and initiating model training.

## Classes

### `OpenAIModel`

The core class for managing OpenAI interactions.

**Attributes:**

* `model`: The OpenAI model ID to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`). Can be customized.
* `client`: An instance of the `OpenAI` client.
* `current_job_id`: Stores the ID of the current training job.
* `assistant_id`: The ID of the assistant to use. Defaults to a value from `gs.credentials.openai.assistant_id.code_assistant`.
* `assistant`: The assistant object retrieved from the OpenAI API.
* `thread`: The conversation thread object.
* `system_instruction`: The system instruction for the assistant.
* `dialogue_log_path`: The path to save the conversation dialogue. Uses a timestamp-based filename.
* `dialogue`: A list of dictionaries storing the conversation history (user messages, assistant responses, and sentiments).
* `assistants`: A list of assistants loaded from a JSON file.
* `models_list`: A list of available model IDs.


**Methods:**

* `__init__(system_instruction=None, model_name='gpt-4o-mini', assistant_id=None)`: Initializes the `OpenAIModel` with the API key, system instruction, and assistant ID.  Loads available models and assistants. **Crucially**, it creates the conversation thread and retrieves the assistant object.

* `list_models()`:  Fetches and returns a list of available OpenAI models.  Handles potential errors during API communication.

* `list_assistants()`: Loads a list of available assistants from a JSON file (`assistants.json` in the specified location).  Robust error handling is essential.

* `set_assistant(assistant_id)`: Sets the assistant to use based on the provided `assistant_id`.

* `_save_dialogue()`: Saves the current `dialogue` to the `dialogue_log_path`. Uses `j_dumps` for JSON serialization.

* `determine_sentiment(message)`: Analyzes a message and returns its sentiment ('positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'). Uses a simple keyword-based approach.

* `ask(message, system_instruction=None, attempts=3)`: Sends a message to the OpenAI model and returns the response.  Includes sentiment analysis and appends messages to the dialogue list.  Important retry mechanism for error handling.  Handles `system_instruction` argument. Escapes quotes in messages for correct JSON formatting.

* `describe_image(image_path, prompt=None, system_instruction=None)`:  Describes an image based on a prompt. Accepts an image path and optionally a prompt or a system instruction for the model. Uses base64 encoding for image inclusion in the message. Handles a more structured response than `ask`.

* `describe_image_by_requests(image_path, prompt=None)`:  This method uses the lower-level `requests` library to communicate with the OpenAI API.

* `dynamic_train()`: Attempts to load previous dialogue (from 'dailogue.json') and fine-tune the model using `client.chat.completions.create`. Important for conversation flow.

* `train(data=None, data_dir=None, data_file=None, positive=True)`: Trains the model on the provided data (CSV file or directory). Stores the training job ID and handles potential exceptions during training.

* `save_job_id(job_id, description, filename="job_ids.json")`: Saves the training job ID and description to a JSON file.


## `main()` function

Demonstrates the usage of the `OpenAIModel` class.  Includes examples of listing models, asking questions, performing dynamic training, training the model, describing images, and saving the training job ID.  Uses `gs` which is likely a custom global namespace to access paths and credentials.

## Module Usage Notes

* **Error Handling:** The code includes substantial error handling (try...except blocks) to catch exceptions during API calls, file operations, and JSON parsing. This is critical for robustness.
* **Logging:** Utilizes the `logger` object from the `src.logger` module for informative logging of events, errors, and debug information.
* **External Dependencies:** Imports necessary libraries like `openai`, `pandas`, `requests`, `PIL`, and custom utility functions from the `src` directory (`j_loads`, `j_dumps`, `base64encode`, `md2dict`).
* **Global State (`gs`):**  The `gs` object is central to handling paths and credentials. Make sure this is correctly defined and populated.
* **Data Handling:** Clearly indicates expected data formats (CSV) for training.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the code's functionality and design. Remember to ensure that the necessary external libraries and configurations (`gs` object) are correctly set up for the code to execute properly.
