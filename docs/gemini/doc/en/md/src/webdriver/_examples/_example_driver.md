## `main` Function

### Description

The `main` function demonstrates the use of the `Driver` class with different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). It navigates to a URL, extracts the domain, scrolls the page, and saves cookies for each browser.

### Parameters

This function doesn't accept any parameters.


### Returns

This function doesn't return any value.


### Raises

- No exceptions are explicitly raised by the `main` function, but exceptions raised by the `Driver` class methods could potentially occur.


#### Example usage with Chrome

```python
# Create an instance of the Driver class with the Chrome webdriver
print("Creating a Chrome browser instance...")
chrome_driver = Driver(Chrome)

try:
    # ... (code to interact with the Chrome driver)
except Exception as ex:
    print(f"An error occurred with Chrome: {ex}")
finally:
    chrome_driver.quit()
    print("Chrome browser closed.")
```


#### Example usage with Firefox

```python
# Create an instance of the Driver class with the Firefox webdriver
print("Creating a Firefox browser instance...")
firefox_driver = Driver(Firefox)

try:
    # ... (code to interact with the Firefox driver)
except Exception as ex:
    print(f"An error occurred with Firefox: {ex}")
finally:
    firefox_driver.quit()
    print("Firefox browser closed.")
```


#### Example usage with Edge

```python
# Create an instance of the Driver class with the Edge webdriver
print("Creating an Edge browser instance...")
edge_driver = Driver(Edge)

try:
    # ... (code to interact with the Edge driver)
except Exception as ex:
    print(f"An error occurred with Edge: {ex}")
finally:
    edge_driver.quit()
    print("Edge browser closed.")
```
