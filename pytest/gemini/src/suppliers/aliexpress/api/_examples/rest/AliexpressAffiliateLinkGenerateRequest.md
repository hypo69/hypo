# check that they're properly stored in attributes and
# potentially call the base class init to verify it

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_getapiname_valid`).

2. **Data Fixture (`example_request`):** A fixture is created to provide an instance of the class for use in multiple tests, promoting code reusability and keeping tests concise.

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**  Basic tests for the `getapiname` method and attribute initialization are added.  Crucially, tests now examine the default values of attributes after initialization.

4. **Edge Case and Error Handling:** A test for handling an invalid domain in the constructor (and any other potential error types).  **Crucially**, this assumes an error is raised in the base class if the domain is not a string. If no error is raised then a more specific test for the actual type of error is needed.

5. **Thoroughness:**  The tests are now more robust by checking for both valid and invalid inputs (or potential errors, even though we can't test specific errors without knowing the base class).

6. **Comments:**  Added comments explaining the logic of each test, which is crucial for readability.


**Critical Considerations:**

* **`RestApi` Class:** To create truly comprehensive tests, you'll need to know how the `RestApi` class works.  If it does any validation or initialization within its `__init__`, you need test cases to cover those aspects as well.
* **Missing Context:**  The provided code snippet is incomplete.  Real-world tests need to be written in context with the other parts of the system (especially the rest of the `AliexpressAffiliateLinkGenerateRequest` class and the methods or classes it interacts with).  Without that full picture, the test suite can't be truly exhaustive.


To make the tests even better, you should add more sophisticated tests involving:

* **Interaction with other methods:**  If the class calls other methods, verify that those calls are performed correctly.
* **Input validation:**  If the class performs any input validation (e.g., checking types), add tests to ensure that validation is working as expected.
* **Exceptions:** If the class is designed to raise specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError` for bad input), add tests to verify the proper handling of those exceptions.


Remember to adapt these tests to match the actual implementation details of the class and its dependencies. Provide the complete code of `RestApi` for more complete testing.
