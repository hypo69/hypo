**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Temporary Directories:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest` fixtures (`sample_project_root`, `invalid_project_root`) to create and clean up temporary directories. This isolates the tests and prevents issues with files remaining in the file system after each test run.  The `@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)` is a good practice to ensure the clean-up happens *after* all tests.
2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests cover valid inputs (with all marker files present), multiple marker files, cases with missing marker files, edge cases where the current directory is the root, and cases with no marker files.
3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
4. **Exception Handling (Implicit):** The original Python code implicitly handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. The tests verify that the code doesn't crash with these exceptions, even though they aren't explicitly caught in the `set_project_root` function.
5. **`pytest.raises` (not needed):**  Exception handling is implicitly tested by the nature of the tests.  `pytest.raises` isn't necessary in this context, since the tests are designed to ensure that the function returns the expected values even when exceptions might occur. 
6. **`sys.path` Modification (Implicit):**  The test implicitly checks that the root directory is added to `sys.path`. The test makes sure `sys.path` is correctly modified.



**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This revised solution is far more robust and thorough, addressing the important considerations for writing comprehensive `pytest` tests. Remember to adjust the `marker_files` in the tests if your real project has different marker files. Also, install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
