```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Modules:** Imports `pytest`, `sys`, `Path` for proper testing.
2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive and follow the guidelines.
3. **Comprehensive Tests:** Added tests for `test_set_project_root_marker_not_found` to cover cases where the marker files are not present.
4. **Edge Case Testing:** The `test_set_project_root_marker_not_found` case addresses an important edge case where marker files aren't found in the path, ensuring the function doesn't raise errors.
5. **Exception Handling:** `test_set_project_root_file_not_found_raises_exception` demonstrates handling of the exception, improving robustness.
6. **Fixture Example:** A dummy fixture is added to illustrate how to create and use fixtures if needed. (Note that in this code, no actual fixture is used).
7. **Directory Management:** Importantly, the code now creates temporary directories and files, cleans them up afterward.  This prevents issues with accidental modification of the project's file system, a critical aspect of reliable testing.
8. **Correct Exception Type:** The `pytest.raises` now correctly specifies `FileNotFoundError` for the specific situation.
9. **`os.chdir`:** Critically, the code now uses `os.chdir` to set the working directory correctly for testing different scenarios without permanently altering the current environment.
10. **Clearer Assertions:** Improved assertion messages to make failures easier to debug.
11. **`sys.path` Handling**: A test `test_set_project_root_root_already_in_path` added to handle the case when the root directory is already present in `sys.path`, demonstrating the proper handling of this edge case.


Remember to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

This revised solution addresses the prompt's requirements and provides more robust and comprehensive test cases for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace the example test function and fixture with your actual test logic. Remember to adjust the paths in the example to match your test structure.
