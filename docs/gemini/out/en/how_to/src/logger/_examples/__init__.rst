How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a constant named `MODE` with the string value 'dev'. It also imports necessary modules from the `packaging.version` and `logger._examples.version` modules. This structure is part of a larger project, likely a logging module (`hypotez/src/logger`), and defines various constant values, and imports versioning related data.  It's a part of the module initialization, crucial for setting up the logging environment and possibly other related configurations.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block first defines a constant `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'.  This constant likely controls the logging mode (e.g., development, production).
2. The code imports `Version` from the `packaging.version` module. This module is likely for handling package version information.
3. The code imports `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from a module named `.version` within the same `logger._examples` directory. This suggests the existence of version-related data within the `_examples` package.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.logger._examples import MODE
    print(MODE)
