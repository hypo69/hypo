**Changes Made**:

- Added a module docstring in RST format to describe the purpose of the module.
- Added a more descriptive docstring for the module level docstring using RST.
- Added a placeholder for logging configuration.  Crucial for production-level code to log errors and other important events.  You'll need to fill in actual logging configuration.
- Improved the formatting of the existing docstrings for better readability.
- Added `:author:` to the module docstring as best practice.
- Added a note for potential additional imports that may be needed in the module if there are functions or classes in this module that depend on other modules. This makes the docstring more complete and useful.

**Important Considerations (not code changes):**

- **Logging Configuration:**  The improved code includes a placeholder for logging configuration.  You need to implement proper logging configuration for the application.  This is essential for debugging and understanding the flow of your application.
- **Error Handling:** The current code lacks error handling.  Add `try...except` blocks around file operations (if any) to catch potential exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `JSONDecodeError`) and log appropriate error messages.
- **Data Validation:** Validate the input data to prevent unexpected behavior or errors.  Consider using a validation library like Pydantic if you're working with complex data structures.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests (`pytest` is recommended) to ensure that the code functions correctly and to catch potential regressions.  Test both successful and error cases.
- **`src.utils.jjson` Imports:** Verify that the necessary imports `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` are actually available in `src.utils.jjson`.  If not, you will need to include these in your file structure.  This is needed to replace the deprecated `json.load` method.


These changes make the code more robust, readable, and maintainable, addressing the requirements for better Python practices and documentation. Remember to replace placeholders and adapt the changes to your specific project structure and requirements.
