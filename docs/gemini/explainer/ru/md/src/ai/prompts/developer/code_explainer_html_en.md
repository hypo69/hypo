<input code>
```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. The code imports the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
2. It defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
3. Inside `add_numbers`, it calls `calculate_sum` with `a` and `b` as arguments.
4. The result returned by `calculate_sum` is assigned to the variable `result`.
5. The function returns the value of `result`.

Example:
- Input data: `a = 5`, `b = 3`.
- Algorithm:
    - `calculate_sum(5, 3)` is executed.
    - `calculate_sum` returns the sum of 5 and 3, which is 8.
    - The value 8 is assigned to `result`.
    - The function returns 8.


<explanation>
**Imports**:
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `utils` subdirectory of the `src` package.  This indicates a modular design, separating concerns. `calculate_sum` likely performs the core addition logic.


**Function `add_numbers`**:
- **Purpose**: The `add_numbers` function takes two numerical inputs (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum calculated using the `calculate_sum` function.  It provides a higher-level abstraction, hiding the implementation details of the summation process.
- **Arguments**:
    - `a`: The first number to be added.
    - `b`: The second number to be added.  Both are assumed to be numbers (integers or floats).
- **Return Value**: The sum of `a` and `b`.


**Relationship with other packages**:
- The code depends on the `src.utils.calculator` module for the `calculate_sum` function. This implies a layered architecture, where `utils` provides utility functions for other parts of the application.


**Potential Improvements**:
- **Type Hinting**: Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int`) would improve code readability and maintainability by explicitly specifying the expected types of the input and output. This would also allow static analysis tools to detect potential type errors.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to handle cases where `a` or `b` are not numbers.  For example, `try...except` block could handle potential `TypeError` exceptions.
- **Docstrings**: Adding comprehensive docstrings to both `calculate_sum` and `add_numbers` would significantly enhance code documentation and clarity.
