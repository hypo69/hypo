**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mock Files:** Introduced `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures to create temporary mock files for testing. This isolates the tests and avoids modifying the system's file structure. Crucial for robust testing.
* **Error Handling Tests:** Added tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to verify the exception handling in the code.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test names to be more descriptive and informative.
* **Robust `set_project_root` tests:** Included tests for the cases where the marker file is not in the current directory, or the marker file is in the parent directory, ensuring code behaves correctly across different file structures.
* **Correct File Cleanup:** The added `shutil.rmtree()` function within the tests ensures that the created temporary files/directories are removed after each test run.  This prevents test failures from leftover files and keeps your testing environment clean.
* **Example Usage:** The tests now demonstrate how to use the fixtures to provide mock data.
* **`monkeypatch` for testing exceptions:** Introduced `monkeypatch` from `pytest` to mock the existence of the `settings.json` file for more effective exception testing.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  **Install pytest:** If you don't have pytest installed, run `pip install pytest`.
3.  **Run tests:** Run the command `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing `test_header.py` and the `hypotez` directory.

This revised solution provides more comprehensive and reliable tests, covering various scenarios and edge cases. Remember to adjust the fixtures to match your actual file structure. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress"` with the actual path to the file if different.  Make sure you have a `hypotez` directory and all the required files for the code to execute successfully.
