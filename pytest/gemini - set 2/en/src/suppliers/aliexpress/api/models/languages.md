**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_language_constants`:** This is a crucial test.  It checks that *all* the defined constants exist and are strings.  This is a much more robust way to validate the class than just testing a single language.  Crucially, this checks for an *invalid* language (non-existent) and tests that a `AttributeError` is raised, rather than a simple `NameError`

2. **`test_invalid_language_input` (commented):** This example tests for an invalid language constant.  It's a good practice to test for cases where an unknown language constant is passed to the class (e.g., a user providing an incorrect language code). The use of `pytest.raises` is important here.

3. **Clearer Test Function Names:** The test names are now more descriptive (`test_language_constants`, etc.)

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** By testing the validity of *all* constants, the test covers a wider range of scenarios, ensuring the code is resilient against various inputs.

5. **Use of `pytest.raises`:** The commented `test_invalid_language_input` correctly uses `pytest.raises` to verify that an `AttributeError` is raised for an invalid language.  This is vital for testing exception handling.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_languages.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_languages.py`

**Important Considerations for Real-World Use:**

* **Data Validation:**  In a real application, you would likely use this language data for something (e.g., fetching localized strings or using it in a database).  Tests would likely include using this data with actual systems (e.g., fetching data from a mocked database).
* **Language Data Source:**  Consider how the language data is sourced in a real application.  If it's loaded from a file or database, add tests to ensure data is loaded correctly and that the class handles unexpected file contents or database errors gracefully.  This example is very basic.  More tests would be needed for that.


By including tests for constant validity and exception handling, you are creating a much more robust testing suite, demonstrating proper behavior in situations that are more likely to occur in a live environment.
