How to use the product module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `product` module manages product data, including processing, validation, and field management.  It provides functions for creating, updating, and deleting product records, ensuring compliance with business rules.  The `product_fields` module handles validation and formatting for product fields.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the necessary modules:** Import the `product` module and any specific functions or classes needed.  This typically involves importing from `product.py` and potentially `product_fields`.

2. **Create a product object (using product.py):** Utilize functions within the `product` module to instantiate a product object, such as a `Product` class or similar construct.  This step often involves providing required data about the product.

3. **Populate product attributes/fields:**  Use methods within the `product.py` module to set attributes of the product object, such as its name, description, or other key details.  This step often involves interacting with data input by users.

4. **Validate product data (using product_fields):** If needed, employ validation logic within the `product_fields` module to ensure that the product data meets specified criteria. This validates fields against business rules and data constraints.

5. **Process the product (using product.py):** Execute functions within `product.py` to perform actions such as creating, updating, or deleting the product record.  These functions may involve database interactions or updates to the product object.

6. **Manage product fields (using product_fields):** The `product_fields` module can manage aspects such as formatting, data type conversion, and validation. For instance, it may handle input validation on product names or pricing.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Import necessary modules
    import product

    # Create a new product
    new_product = product.create_product(
        name="Example Product",
        description="A sample product for testing",
        price=99.99,
    )

    # Validate the product name
    if not product.validate_product_name(new_product.name):
        print("Product name validation failed!")
    else:
        # Attempt to update the product
        updated_product = product.update_product(
            product_id=new_product.id,
            price=129.99,
        )

        # Delete the product
        product.delete_product(product_id=updated_product.id)
