```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Tests:**  Tests now cover valid duration/delay, zero duration, negative duration, zero delay, negative delay, and very short delay, providing better coverage of the `show_spinner` function.
* **Exception Handling:**  Added `pytest.raises` to test the error handling for negative duration and negative delay.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and informative.
* **Edge Cases:**  Tests for edge cases like zero duration and delay are included.
* **Output Verification:** Added `capture_stdout` to capture console output generated by `show_spinner`. Now, the code checks for the presence of any output, which is crucial for functions that print to the console. This is crucial for testing the spinner output.
* **Parameterization:** The `test_show_spinner_output` test now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run with different `duration` values, allowing a more concise test.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_cursor_spinner.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_cursor_spinner.py`


This revised test suite is more robust and thorough in covering the functionality of the `cursor_spinner` module. Remember to place the `hypotez/src/utils/cursor_spinner.py` code in the same directory as the test file for easier referencing.  This comprehensive approach ensures that the code behaves correctly under various conditions. Remember to run the tests frequently as you modify the code under test to ensure continuous correctness.
