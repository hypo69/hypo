```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The crucial addition is the `mock_openai_client` fixture.  This allows us to control the return value of `openai_utils.client().send_message()`.  This isolates the test from the external OpenAI API and ensures the tests are reproducible and fast.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The `test_default_llmm_api_empty_response` and `test_default_llmm_api_invalid_response_type` tests demonStarte error handling. They are now using `pytest.raises` to verify that the correct exceptions are raised in the presence of an empty or incorrect response.
* **UTF-8 Encoding Check (Robust):** The `test_default_llmm_api_valid_response` now includes a robust UTF-8 encoding check. The previous approach was prone to failure if the error was not precisely an `UnicodeEncodeError`.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive and easier to understand.
* **Placeholder for Testing Utils:** The `@pytest.fixture` is now a placeholder assuming `testing_utils` provides the necessary `create_test_system_user_message`. Replace this with the actual fixture from `testing_utils.py`.
* **Import statements corrected:**  Ensured that necessary imports are included.

**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Place the code in a file named `test_security.py`.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_security.py
    ```

Remember to replace the placeholder `testing_utils` functions and the mocked API responses with actual ones.  If you need to test various scenarios for different responses from the LLM, create more test cases in this structure. This improved approach will help you validate the security-related aspects of your code more comprehensively and reliably. Remember to adapt this to your actual `testing_utils` and `openai_utils` modules.
