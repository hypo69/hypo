## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/__init__.py`

This module provides functions and classes for managing AliExpress advertising campaigns.  It's designed for use in a Python environment and particularly focuses on automating campaign handling tasks.

**Key Components:**

* **`AliCampaignEditor`:**  This likely represents a core class for interacting with AliExpress campaign data.  More detailed usage instructions are needed, but likely involves methods for creating, updating, and retrieving campaign information.

* **`process_campaign`:** This function, along with `process_campaign_category` and `process_all_campaigns`,  indicates automation tasks for campaign management.  Detailed documentation is necessary to understand the inputs, outputs, and how to utilize these functions efficiently.

* **`CategoryHTMLGenerator` and `ProductHTMLGenerator`:** These classes suggest functionality to generate HTML representations of campaign categories and products. This is likely used to display or export campaign information in a web-friendly format.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

To use the `AliCampaignEditor` class, you would likely do something like this (remember, this is a placeholder; specific details are missing from the provided code):


```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign import AliCampaignEditor

# Initialize an editor object
editor = AliCampaignEditor()

# Get a list of campaigns
campaigns = editor.get_campaigns()

# Process the campaigns
for campaign in campaigns:
    # Perform actions on each campaign based on needs
    result = editor.update_campaign_budget(campaign, 100)
    if result:
        print(f"Successfully updated campaign: {campaign.name}")


```

**Missing Information and Required Documentation:**

The code snippet provides an overview, but crucial information is missing for comprehensive usage instructions:

* **Detailed descriptions of class methods (e.g., `get_campaigns`, `update_campaign_budget`):**  What are the inputs and expected outputs?  Are there error handling mechanisms? What are the appropriate data structures for campaigns, categories, and products?
* **Input/output data formats:** How are campaigns represented (e.g., dictionaries, custom objects)? What are the expected arguments for each function?
* **Error handling:**  How does the code handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid input data)?
* **Configuration:** How to set the authentication or connection parameters (e.g., API keys, credentials)?
* **Dependencies:**  What libraries are required to use this module?
* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** What does this mode parameter affect? How does this mode affect the application's behavior?
