**Improved Code**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Module for code assistance endpoints.

:module: src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant
"""
# Import necessary modules
from src.logger import logger
from .assistant import CodeAssistant
#MODE = 'development'  # Remove unnecessary variable, it seems to be unused
#This seems to be a placeholder and not needed now.

# ... (rest of the code, if any)


def my_function():
    """
    An example function.

    :return: Description of the return value.
    """
    # ... (your code)
    pass
```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Removed the unused `MODE` variable.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error logging.
- Added an example function `my_function` with docstring.
- Added placeholders for `...` in the code where needed.
- Improved comments to follow RST style guidelines.
