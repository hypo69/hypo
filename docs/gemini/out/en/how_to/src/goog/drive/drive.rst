How to use the Google Drive File Upload Code Block
=============================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a `GoogleDriveHandler` class to interact with Google Drive. The class handles authentication, retrieval of Google Drive credentials, and uploading files to a specified folder within Google Drive.  The `upload_file` method, currently marked as a placeholder, will need implementation for actual file uploading.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports libraries like `pickle`, `os`, `pathlib`, `googleapiclient`, `google_auth`, etc., required for handling files, paths, and Google Drive API interaction.

2. **Define the `GoogleDriveHandler` class:** This class encapsulates the logic for interacting with Google Drive.
    - **`__init__` method:** Initializes the class with the target folder name (`folder_name`) in Google Drive. It also sets up authentication credentials.

3. **`_create_credentials` method:** This method handles the authentication process:
    - It locates the credentials file (`hypo69-c32c8736ca62.json`).
    - It checks for an existing token (`token.pickle`) and loads credentials if available.
    - If no valid credentials are found:
        - It prompts the user to authenticate.
        - It saves the retrieved credentials to `token.pickle`.

4. **`upload_file` method (Placeholder):** This method is currently a stub.  It needs to be implemented with the actual logic for uploading the file specified by `file_path` to the specified folder in Google Drive using the Drive API.

5. **`main` function:** This function demonStartes how to use the `GoogleDriveHandler` class:
    - It instantiates `GoogleDriveHandler`.
    - It retrieves Google Drive credentials.
    - It uses the `drive` API to list all files and folders in Google Drive, printing their names and IDs.

6. **Error Handling (Implied):** The code implicitly handles potential errors during credential retrieval, authentication, and API calls.  However, comprehensive error handling is recommended for production code.

7. **Execution:** When the script is executed (via `if __name__ == "__main__":`), the `main` function is called, initiating the entire process.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    from hypotez.src.goog.drive.drive import GoogleDriveHandler

    # Replace with your actual file path
    file_path = Path('/mnt/data/google_extracted/sample_file.txt') 
    # Replace with the target folder name in Google Drive
    folder_name = 'My Drive Folder'

    try:
        google_drive_handler = GoogleDriveHandler(folder_name=folder_name)
        google_drive_handler.upload_file(file_path)
        print("File uploaded successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
