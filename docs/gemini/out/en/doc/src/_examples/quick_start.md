# hypotez/src/_examples/quick_start.py

## Overview

This module provides a quick start example for the `hypotez` library.  It defines constants and likely serves as a foundational entry point for initial use.


## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**: This constant likely determines the operational mode (e.g., development, production).

**Value**: 'dev'


## Documentation for functions/classes/methods (None found, so no further sections).


This file appears to be a Python module that defines a single constant `MODE`, likely to control behavior in different modes (e.g., development or production).  More complete docstrings with arguments, return values and exceptions are required to further document functions.
