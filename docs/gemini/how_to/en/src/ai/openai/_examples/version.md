How to use the `version.py` module

This guide describes how to utilize the `version.py` module, part of the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples` directory.

**Key Variables and Attributes:**

* `__version__`:  This string variable holds the version number of the module.  In this example, the version is `3.12.0.0.0.4`.  It's crucial for tracking updates and compatibility.

* `__name__`:  This variable's value is either the module name (e.g., `hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version`) or `"__main__"` if the script is run directly.

* `__doc__`:  This string provides documentation for the module.  The existing docstrings are incomplete and should be improved for better understanding.

* `__details__`: This string variable stores additional information about the module or specific version. In this case, it contains the text "Details about version for module or class".

* `__annotations__`:  This variable, likely a dictionary, contains type annotations for functions or variables within the module.  It's empty in this example, so no specific types are defined.

* `__author__`: This variable stores the author(s) of the module. In this example, the author is `hypotez`.

**Example Usage (if running as a script):**

```python
import sys
import os

# Check if the script is being run directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Module Name: {__name__}")
    print(f"Module Version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Module Details: {__details__}")
    print(f"Author: {__author__}")
```

**Explanation:**

This example shows how to access the version, name, and details information if the `version.py` script is executed.  This is a basic approach; more sophisticated usage might involve using these values in configuration files, release notes, or for dynamic version checking within other parts of the codebase.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Docstrings:**  The current docstrings are placeholders.  Proper documentation is crucial for understanding the module's purpose and how to use it effectively.  Thoroughly document each function and class.

* **Type Hinting:** While `__annotations__` is present, it's empty.  In real-world applications, use type hints (`-> type`) for function return values and parameters to increase code readability and maintainability.

* **Error Handling:**  Add error handling to catch potential exceptions if the `__version__` variable or other data are not correctly populated or if the user attempts to use the script in an unsupported way.

* **Module Structure:** If this is part of a larger project, organize the code within the project structure appropriately (e.g., using `__init__.py` files for packages).

**Additional Tips:**

1.  If this module is part of a package, place it in the correct directory structure.

2.  Document the module, functions, and variables comprehensively.

3.  Maintain consistent formatting and style within your code.

4.  Use appropriate version control to track changes.

By following these best practices, you can significantly improve the usability and maintainability of your `version.py` module.
