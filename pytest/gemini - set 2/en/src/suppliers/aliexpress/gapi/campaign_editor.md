# If the actual code uses a different library or method, the tests
# need to be adjusted accordingly.  Also note that the fixtures should be
# appropriate to the structure of the `campaign_editor` code.



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  A `example_spreadsheet` fixture is introduced to mock the `SpreadSheet` object.  This is crucial because the provided code snippet doesn't include the `SpreadSheet` class's definition, making direct testing impossible.  Replace this with a proper fixture if `SpreadSheet` is defined in the actual file.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases (Placeholders):**  The tests are expanded to cover scenarios like an empty spreadsheet, and a situation where the `SpreadSheet` class is not found.  Crucially, the tests now *directly* relate to the parts of the code that we actually *can* test.


3. **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test for exceptions (e.g., `NameError` if `SpreadSheet` is not defined).


4. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive, making the purpose of each test evident.


5. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is designed to be independent.

**How to Use These Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Save the tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_campaign_editor.py`) in the same directory as your `campaign_editor.py` file.

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_campaign_editor.py
   ```

**Critical Next Steps:**

* **Replace the mock:**  If you have the actual implementation of `SpreadSheet` available, replace the example `example_spreadsheet` fixture with a proper fixture that creates and returns instances of `SpreadSheet` and any other necessary objects.  This will significantly improve the tests' value.

* **Test actual functions:**  Replace the example test functions with ones that directly test functions in `campaign_editor.py` such as those dealing with the interactions with the spreadsheet.  These will likely require creating data and expected results.


By incorporating these steps, you can develop accurate and robust tests that are relevant to the actual logic of your `campaign_editor` code.  Remember to adapt these templates to the actual functionality of the `campaign_editor` functions.
