**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **Mocking `chrome.runtime`:** The provided code interacts with the `chrome.runtime` API, which is a browser API.  You cannot directly execute or test this code in a standard Python environment.  To test the `addListener` function, we need to mock the `chrome.runtime` object.   The test now uses a mock listener to capture the logged message.  Crucially, it restores the original listener function at the end of the test.  This avoids unexpected behavior in subsequent tests or the actual browser extension.

2. **Import `chrome`:**  You'll need to have a mock `chrome` module in your testing environment. This mock module should allow you to define and test the API functions (like `addListener`).  This is the missing piece in the original prompt.

3. **No Real Browser Interaction:**  The test does *not* interact with an actual browser.  It asserts that if the code were executed within a browser environment, the correct functionality should be observed.

4. **Robust Testing:** The `test_onInstalled_listener_logs_message` function now covers the primary functionality and ensures correct logging.

**To run these tests:**

1. **Create a `chrome` module mock:**  Create a Python file (e.g., `chrome_mock.py`) containing the mock `chrome.runtime` object (or simply stub it for this simple case).  Example:

```python
# chrome_mock.py
import logging
class Runtime:
    onInstalled = {"addListener": lambda callback: None}


# or the stub:

# class Runtime:
#     onInstalled = {"addListener": lambda callback: callback({"message": "something"})}

import chrome_mock as chrome  # Import the mock in your test file
```

2. **Save the test code (above) as a `.py` file** (e.g., `test_background.py`)

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_background.py
   ```


This improved solution addresses the critical issue of testing code that interacts with browser APIs.  It's essential to mock these APIs in testing because you can't directly execute them in a Python environment.  The mocking approach ensures that the tests run without interfering with the real browser. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
