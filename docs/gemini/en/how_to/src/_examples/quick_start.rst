How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block, located in `hypotez/src/_examples/quick_start.py`, defines a constant `MODE` with the string value 'dev'.  It's a simple example of setting a configuration variable, likely used to determine the operational mode (e.g., development, production).  The code also includes numerous docstrings, but these are largely empty and don't provide concrete instructions.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block sets a variable named `MODE` to the string value 'dev'.
2. The code includes numerous multiline strings (docstrings) that are not used in the execution. These strings are for documentation purposes and explain the context of the code, but have no impact on the execution flow.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Access the MODE variable in another script or function.
    import sys
    from hypotez.src._examples.quick_start import MODE

    print(f"The current mode is: {MODE}")

    # Example usage within a larger application
    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
        # Specific code for the development environment
    elif MODE == 'prod':
        print("Running in production mode.")
        # Specific code for the production environment
    else:
        print("Unknown mode.")
