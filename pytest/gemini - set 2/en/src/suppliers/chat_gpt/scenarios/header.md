```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs`:**  Crucially, the code now uses `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `gs` module.  This isolates the `set_project_root` function from the external file system. Without mocking, your tests would actually try to access files, leading to unpredictable and unreliable results.

2. **Mocking `settings.json` and `README.MD`:**  Files are created/populated within the tests, making them more reliable.

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The test cases now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, which were missing in the original.

4. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better describe the specific scenario being tested.

5. **Fixture for Data:**  A `mocked_settings` fixture is added to provide test data for cases where `settings.json` exists. A corresponding `mocked_readme` fixture is also added.

6. **`mocked_gs_path` Fixture:**  A fixture to allow you to control the base path.

7. **Return Values:** The tests now explicitly check the return value of `set_project_root`, and retrieve expected values where appropriate (like `doc_str`).

8. **Example `test_settings_loading_success`:** DemonStartes the use of `mocked_settings` to pass data and how to assert against it.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the above test code in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved structure makes the tests much more robust, reliable, and easier to understand.  Remember to adapt the `mocked_gs_path` to a real value if `gs` becomes available.  Also, consider adding more tests covering different input scenarios and potential exception conditions for better test coverage. Remember to create a directory structure resembling the one in the original code (src, settings.json, README.MD) when running.
