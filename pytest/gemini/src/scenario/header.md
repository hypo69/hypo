**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`test_set_project_root_valid_input()`:**  Now correctly handles creating temporary files and folders within a temporary directory and checks the result. Also includes cleanup to prevent file system pollution.  Crucially, it restores the original value of `builtins.__file__` to avoid problems with other tests.


* **`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files()` and `test_set_project_root_marker_file_in_parent_directory()`:**  These tests are added to cover cases where no marker files are found and when the marker files exist in the parent directory.  They also include file cleanup.

* **`settings_file_path` Fixture:**  A fixture is introduced to simplify creating and managing a temporary settings.json file for the other tests. This prevents repeated setup code and makes the tests more readable.

* **`test_settings_loading_success` and `test_settings_loading_file_not_found`:** These are examples to help you get started; you should add tests for README.md too.  They now use the `settings_file_path` fixture.

* **Exception Handling:** The original code lacked comprehensive exception handling. These tests cover `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

* **Clearer Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


Remember to replace the placeholder `...` in the original code with appropriate implementations and add more tests to cover all aspects of the `header.py` functions, including error handling.  The `test_header.py` file should be placed in a directory that's part of the `hypotez` project's testing suite. The key here is to properly mock the external calls and manage temporary files to avoid interference with real files and directories in your file system.
