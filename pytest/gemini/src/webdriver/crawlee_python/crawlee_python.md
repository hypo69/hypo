**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `logger` and `PlaywrightCrawler` for isolated testing.  This is crucial for testing asynchronous functions effectively.

2. **Fixtures:** Fixtures are used for better organization and re-use of data/mocking.  The `mock_crawler` fixture is particularly important for isolating the tests.

3. **Clearer Tests:** Test names are more descriptive (`test_crawlee_python_run_with_valid_urls`).

4. **`asyncio.run`:**  Crucially, `asyncio.run` is used in each test to run the asynchronous methods. This is essential for proper asynchronous testing.


5. **Assertions:** Assertions are added to validate the expected behavior of the methods.

6. **`@pytest.mark.asyncio` (Optional but good practice):** For future code, consider using `@pytest.mark.asyncio` on test functions that use `async` methods. This makes the tests' asynchronous nature explicit.

7. **Comprehensive Testing (Example):**  The example `test_crawlee_python_run_with_valid_urls` demonstrates how to structure a test that covers multiple method calls in a realistic scenario.


**How to run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the tests in a file named `test_crawlee_python.py` (or similar).
3. Place your `crawlee_python.py` file in the same directory.
4. Run `pytest test_crawlee_python.py` from your terminal.

**Important:**  You still need to replace the placeholder `gs` imports with the actual `gs` module to have working tests. Also, to use the `mock_crawler`, you need to make sure that the `crawlee.PlaywrightCrawler` class and the related functions exist.  Crucially, ensure the `logger` and any other external dependencies are mocked or replaced correctly for your test environment.  If your `src.logger.logger` depends on external settings, you should mock these settings as well, rather than attempting to use their actual values. Remember to adapt the test cases to match the real functionality of your code, including edge cases and potential exceptions. Add tests for error cases and boundary conditions for thorough testing.
