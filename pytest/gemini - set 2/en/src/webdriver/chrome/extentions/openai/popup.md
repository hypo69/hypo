```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  
#  Therefore, no tests can be written.  
# HTML files are for defining the structure of web pages, 
# not for containing executable Python code.
#  Please provide the relevant JavaScript/TypeScript code 
#  (popup.js, or similar) to generate meaningful tests.

# Example (IlluStartive - Replace with actual code):
# Assuming a popup.js file like this:

# (example popup.js)
# function sendMessage(message) {
#   // ... send message logic ...
#   return "Response to: " + message;
# }

# (example test_popup.py)
# import pytest
# from selenium import webdriver
# from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
# from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC


# @pytest.fixture
# def driver():
#     driver = webdriver.Chrome()
#     yield driver
#     driver.quit()


# def test_send_message(driver):
#     driver.get("file:///path/to/popup.html")  # Replace with actual path

#     # Find elements using appropriate selectors
#     message_input = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "textarea")
#     send_button = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "button")
#     response_element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "response")


#     message_input.send_keys("Hello!")
#     send_button.click()

#     # Wait for the response to appear (adjust your wait time)
#     WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
#         EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "//div[@id='response']/p"))
#     )

#     response = response_element.text
#     assert "Response to: Hello!" in response
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Python Code to Test:** The provided input is HTML.  You need the corresponding JavaScript/TypeScript code (e.g., `popup.js`) to write meaningful tests.  The tests would need to interact with the JavaScript functions.

2. **Selenium for Integration Tests:**  Since the provided code involves a web page,  Selenium or a similar browser automation framework is essential for integration testing.  The example shows how to use `pytest`, `selenium` to locate elements on the page, send messages, and verify responses.

3. **Element Locators:** In the example tests, replace placeholders like `By.TAG_NAME`, and `By.ID` with the correct locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPaths) to find elements.

4. **Waiting:**  `WebDriverWait` is essential for ensuring elements are loaded before interacting with them.  Adjust the `timeout` in `WebDriverWait` appropriately for your application.

5. **Error Handling:** In real tests, add more robust error handling (e.g., using `try...except` blocks) to catch potential exceptions during element interactions and JavaScript execution.


**How to proceed:**

1. **Provide `popup.js`:**  Share the relevant JavaScript or TypeScript code for the popup.
2. **Use Selenium:**  Install the `selenium` library using `pip install selenium`.
3. **Adjust Locators:**  Identify and correctly specify locators for your elements within the HTML.
4. **Wait Startegy:** Implement robust waits to ensure that elements are loaded and interactions are successful.


Once you provide the JavaScript code, I can generate accurate and functional tests using `pytest` and `selenium`.
