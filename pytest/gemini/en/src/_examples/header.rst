```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `__file__`:**  Crucially, the `test_set_project_root_*` functions now use `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `__file__` attribute. This is essential because these tests create temporary directories to avoid modifying the user's actual file system.  Without this mocking, the test would attempt to resolve paths to nonexistent `__file__` attributes.
* **Temporary Directory Setup:** Tests now create and clean up temporary directories to avoid polluting the user's actual filesystem. This is standard practice for robust testing.
* **Clearer Test Descriptions:** The docstrings explain the purpose of each test case more clearly, aiding readability and understanding.
* **Edge Case (`test_set_project_root_not_found`):** Added a test case specifically to check for the situation where no marker files are found in the current or any parent directories.
* **Edge Case (`test_set_project_root_marker_in_parent`):** Added a test that verifies that the function correctly finds the root when the marker file is in a parent directory.
* **Robust File Handling**: The code now effectively sets up and cleans up the test environment to avoid conflicts.
* **`sys.path` Check (`test_set_project_root_already_in_path`):**  Added a test case that explicitly checks if the project root is correctly inserted into `sys.path` when not already present.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


**Important Considerations for Exception Handling:**

The provided code's `try...except` blocks for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`  are *not* tested in the above code.  To fully test exception handling, you would need to mock the `open()` function and test the specific error conditions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) with `pytest.raises`. This will ensure that exceptions are handled correctly, rather than just being caught without asserting the behavior within the `except` block.  Add appropriate test cases for that specific exception handling.
