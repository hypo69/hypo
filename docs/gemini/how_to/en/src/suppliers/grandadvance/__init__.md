## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/__init__.py`, serves as the initialization file for the `grandadvance` supplier module within the `hypotez` project.  It imports the necessary components and likely sets up variables for the module's operation mode.

**Key elements and how to use them:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This line defines a variable `MODE` and assigns it the string value `'dev'`.  This likely indicates the current operational mode of the supplier.  Different values for `MODE` (e.g., `'prod'`, `'test'`) could trigger different behaviors within the supplier's internal logic, like using different data sources or configurations.  To change the operational mode, simply change the string assigned to this variable.

* **`from .graber import Graber`:** This imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` file within the `grandadvance` module. This is crucial as it makes the `Graber` class available for use throughout the rest of the codebase that uses this `grandadvance` module.  You will likely need to use `Graber` to interact with the data sourcing logic provided by `grandadvance`.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.grandadvance import Graber

# Create an instance of the Graber class.  This assumes there's a constructor
# for the class that takes any necessary configuration
graber_instance = Graber(mode=MODE)  # Pass the MODE variable

# Now you can use methods of the Graber class
data = graber_instance.get_data()
# ... (process data)...

print(data)
```

**Further Considerations:**

* **`graber.py`:** The code implies a `graber.py` file exists within the `grandadvance` directory.  Understanding the functionality of the `Graber` class within that file is critical for effective usage of the supplier.

* **Error Handling:** The provided example lacks error handling.  Robust code should include error handling for cases where data retrieval fails or if `Graber` throws exceptions.

* **Configuration:** The example shows passing `MODE` to the `Graber` constructor.  You might have additional configuration options that the `Graber` class expects.  Read the docstrings or comments within `graber.py` to understand the expected parameters.

* **Data format:** The example doesn't show how the `get_data` method returns data. The format of the `data` retrieved from `Graber` is essential to know how to handle it.

This guide provides a basic understanding of the `__init__.py` file's role.  More detailed usage instructions will be needed for specific tasks if you have concrete questions about how to get data, handle exceptions, or modify parameters based on operational mode.
