**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now precisely describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_prestashop_shop_init_valid_credentials`).
* **ValueError Handling:**  Crucially, tests now explicitly check for `ValueError` exceptions when the `api_domain` or `api_key` are missing. The error messages are checked for precise matching, making the tests more robust.
* **Fixture for Credentials:** A `valid_credentials` fixture is introduced to make the tests more organized and reusable.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  Tests cover various initialization scenarios: valid credentials (as `SimpleNamespace` and `dict`), missing `api_domain`, missing `api_key`, and missing keys/values within the credentials dictionary.
* **Edge Cases:**  The tests now adequately cover cases where either `api_domain` or `api_key` is not provided.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Used correctly for exception testing (missing `api_domain` and `api_key`).
* **Super Call Verification (Crucial):** The `test_prestashop_shop_init_super_call` demonstrates how to verify that the `super().__init__` call is actually made in the derived class. This is a crucial aspect for inheritance correctness.
* **Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_prestashop_shop.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_prestashop_shop.py`


This improved test suite is more thorough and reliable, providing better coverage and ensuring that the `PrestaShopShop` class handles various input conditions correctly. Remember to adapt the fixtures and test cases if the underlying `PrestaShop` class has more complex arguments.
