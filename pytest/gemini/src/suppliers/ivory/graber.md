```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` class and potentially other objects that might not be available for testing.  This is crucial for unit testing. The `MockContext` is also defined for mocking.


2. **Complete Tests:** Added a test for `test_graber_init_with_context` to verify the initialization logic.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init`).


4. **Error Handling:** Includes a test (`test_close_popup_decorator_no_locator`) to handle cases where `Context.locator` might not have a value assigned.  Critically, it now asserts that no error is raised (or that the logger wasn't called with an error message).  This is crucial for robustness.


5. **Fixture for Driver:** A `driver_instance` fixture is created to provide a mock `Driver` object to the `graber` fixture, making the tests more isolated.

6. **`close_pop_up` Decorator Test:** The test now correctly handles the `close_pop_up` decorator *without* a locator value and asserts that no error is raised. This is a fundamental edge case.

7. **Import Handling:** The code includes a `try...except` block to handle potential `ImportError` if `ExecuteLocatorException` is not defined in the source code. This makes the tests more robust.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
2. Make sure pytest is installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_graber.py`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`ExecuteLocatorException`:** If `ExecuteLocatorException` is a crucial part of the code, you need a *real* mock or a test setup that simulates its functionality and handles its potential exceptions.
* **Dependencies:**  Ensure all necessary imports (e.g., `header`, `src.suppliers.graber`, `src.webdriver.driver`, `src.logger`) are correctly defined and available.

This improved solution provides a more comprehensive test suite, making the testing of the `Graber` class much more reliable and robust. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific functions and classes you need to verify from the original code. Remember to replace the placeholder `ExecuteLocatorException` with the actual implementation if it is necessary for testing.
