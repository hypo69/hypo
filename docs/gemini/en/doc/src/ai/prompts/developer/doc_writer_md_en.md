# Module: Programming Assistant

This module provides a `CodeAssistant` class for interacting with various AI models (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) for code processing tasks.  It's designed to assist with code analysis, documentation generation, and potentially code generation.

## Example Usage

```python
from programming_assistant import CodeAssistant

assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='en', model=['gemini'])
result = assistant.process_files(files=['file1.py', 'file2.py'], options={'verbosity': 'high'})

# Process the result...
```

## Platforms and Synopsis

This module is designed to be platform-agnostic, meaning it can function on various operating systems. Its core functionality is centered around interacting with AI models.


## Classes

### `CodeAssistant`

**Description**: The `CodeAssistant` class acts as an interface to interact with AI models for code processing.

**Attributes**:
- `role`: (str) The role the assistant will play (e.g., 'code_checker').
- `lang`: (str) Language of operation.
- `model`: (list) List of AI models to use.

**Methods**:

#### `process_files`

**Description**: Analyzes and processes one or more code files using the specified AI models.

**Parameters**:
- `files` (list): A list of file paths to process.
- `options` (dict, optional): A dictionary of options for controlling processing, such as verbosity level. Defaults to an empty dictionary.


**Returns**:
- `list`: A list containing the analysis results for each file.  Returns `None` if an error occurs during processing.

**Raises**:
- `ValueError`: If the `files` parameter is not a list or `options` is not a dictionary.
- `FileNotFoundError`: If one or more files in the input list do not exist.
- `AIProcessingError`: An exception for issues in interacting with the AI models.


```python
# Example Usage (in a larger script)
try:
    result = assistant.process_files(files=['file1.py', 'file2.py'], options={'verbosity': 'high'})
    if result:
        # Process the result here
        print("Processing completed successfully.")
    else:
        print("Processing failed.")
except FileNotFoundError as ex:
    print(f"Error: File not found - {ex}")
except AIProcessingError as ex:
    print(f"Error processing with AI: {ex}")
