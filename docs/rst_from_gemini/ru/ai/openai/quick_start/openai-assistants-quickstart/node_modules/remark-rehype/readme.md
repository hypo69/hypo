{
  "summary": "This is a README file for the `remark-rehype` package, a Unified plugin that transforms markdown ASTs into HTML ASTs, allowing seamless integration with Rehype plugins for HTML processing.",
  "installation": [
    "Uses npm for installation (ESM only):",
    "```bash\nnpm install remark-rehype\n```",
    "Works with Deno (ESM):",
    "```javascript\nimport remarkRehype from 'https://esm.sh/remark-rehype@11'\n```",
    "Also works in browsers (ESM):",
    "```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import remarkRehype from 'https://esm.sh/remark-rehype@11?bundle'\n</script>\n```"
  ],
  "usage": [
    "Includes a code example demonstrating the use of `remark-rehype` with other plugins (remark-parse, rehype-document, rehype-format, rehype-stringify) and `to-vfile` and `vfile-reporter` to process markdown input file (`example.md`).",
    "Shows how to process and transform the markdown into HTML.",
    "Highlights the transformation of markdown syntax tree (mdast) to HTML syntax tree (hast)."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Transforms markdown (mdast) to HTML (hast).",
    "Allows use of Rehype plugins on the resulting HTML AST.",
    "Supports raw HTML within markdown (with `allowDangerousHtml: true`, use with caution).",
    "Provides handlers and options to customize footnote generation and handling, including language support.",
    "Includes options for handling unknown nodes.",
    "Offers a way to support HTML embedded within markdown through `rehype-raw`.",
    "Provides detailed explanations and examples for various use cases.",
    "Handles potential clobbering issues when using IDs generated from user-provided content for footnotes.",
    "Full TypeScript support with defined types for options."
  ],
  "important_notes": [
    "**Security**: Be cautious with `allowDangerousHtml`. Always sanitize user-provided HTML with `rehype-sanitize` to prevent XSS attacks if you're not completely trusting the content.",
    "**Footnotes**: Carefully manage footnote labels and backreferences, especially if your content isn't in English to ensure accessibility for screen readers. Translation and proper ARIA attributes are essential.",
    "**Bridge mode vs. Mutate mode**: `unified().use(remarkRehype, processor)` will run the (rehype) plugins used on a given processor with a hast tree. The returned value is discarded.  In most cases, you'll want to use the mutate mode (`unified().use(remarkRehype)`) which directly returns a hast tree ready to be further processed by rehype plugins. Avoid using a processor unless you are specifically using the bridge mode.",
  ],
  "api_details": [
     "Detailed explanation of `unified().use(remarkRehype)` with parameters and return types.",
     "Comprehensive description of options (e.g., `allowDangerousHtml`, `clobberPrefix`, `footnoteLabel`, `footnoteLabelProperties`, etc.), explaining how to customize footnote behavior and prevent clobbering.",
     "Detailed explanations of `defaultFootnoteBackContent`, `defaultFootnoteBackLabel`, `defaultHandlers`, and `unknownHandler` for customizing node handling."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Example of na√Øve HTML handling (vulnerable to XSS attacks, use with caution).",
    "Example of proper HTML handling using `rehype-raw` and `rehype-sanitize` for security.",
    "Example demonstrating footnote translation and accessibility for different languages."
