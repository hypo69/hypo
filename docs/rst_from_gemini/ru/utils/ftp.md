""" module: src.utils """


"""
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server.

** Usage Notes:**
- The FTP connection details (_connection) should be defined in a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) to improve maintainability and security.
- Error handling is comprehensive, logging exceptions for debugging purposes.  The `logger` is assumed to be imported from another module.

** Modules used:**
- `helpers` (implied):  Local helper utilities for FTP operations. (This is good documentation, but not strictly necessary in the code as you already import and use them.)
- `typing`: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- `ftplib`: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- `pathlib`: For handling file system paths.
- `logger`: For logging errors.


Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  Uses `ftplib.all_errors` for more robust exception handling within the FTP operations.  This catches a wider range of potential FTP errors. Critically, it now logs the *exception* instead of just the error message, which gives you a much more useful stack trace for debugging.
* **Explicit `FileNotFoundError`:**  Raises `FileNotFoundError` if the source file doesn't exist, providing a more informative error.
* **Configuration:**  Emphasizes the need to move connection details to a separate config file.  This is crucial for security and maintainability.
* **`os.path.exists`:** Checks for the existence of the source file before trying to open it. Prevents errors.
* **Logging:**  Uses `logger.exception` to provide more detailed error messages.  This is far superior than just `logger.error`.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Separate Configuration:**  Create a `config.py` file to store the `_connection` dictionary.  Load it from there in your `ftp.py` script.


```python
# config.py
import os

_connection = {
    'server': os.environ.get('FTP_SERVER', 'ftp.example.com'),
    'port': int(os.environ.get('FTP_PORT', 21)),
    'user': os.environ.get('FTP_USER', 'username'),
    'password': os.environ.get('FTP_PASSWORD', 'password')  # <-- Store passwords securely!
}
```

2. **Environment Variables:**  Use environment variables to store credentials, rather than hardcoding them. This is *essential* for security in production.


This revised code is significantly more robust and maintainable. Remember to install the `ftplib` package if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install ftplib
```
