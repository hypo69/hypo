```python
## \file hypotez/src/project_settings/header.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 # <- venv win
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""" module: src.project_settings """

""" Absolute path to modules  """

import sys,os
from pathlib import Path
__root__ : Path = os.getcwd() [:os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez')+7]
sys.path.append (__root__)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original prompt had a blank space where `"project_settings"` should have been.  The solution replaces the blank with "project_settings".  This is a crucial change because it makes the file and module name accurate and consistent.

**Why this is important for `doc_creator`:**

* **Consistency:**  Using a clear and descriptive name (`project_settings`) helps the documentation system (and any other code that uses this file) understand the purpose of the module.

* **Correctness:**  The correct module name is essential for proper documentation generation. Without it, the documentation might be inaccurate or misleading.

* **Maintainability:**  Clear names make it easier to maintain and update the project's structure and documentation.

* **Readability:**  Consistent naming improves the overall readability and organization of the codebase.

In short, the prompt's intended purpose of creating documentation is best served by accurate and informative file names and module documentation.  Replacing the blank with a meaningful name is the most significant improvement.
