How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` to locate the root directory of a project.  It then retrieves project settings (like name, version, etc.) from a JSON file and project documentation from a markdown file. It also manages adding the project root to the Python path.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging`, and `Path` from `pathlib`.

2. **Define the `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of filenames/directories as input (`marker_files`).

3. **Find project root:** It starts from the directory of the current file and traverses upward in the directory tree. For each parent directory, it checks if any of the specified `marker_files` exists within that directory.  If any are found, it sets `__root__` to that directory and breaks out of the loop.  If not found, `__root__` remains the original directory.

4. **Add root to Python path:**  If the root directory is not already in `sys.path`, it adds it to the beginning of the path.

5. **Get project settings:** It attempts to open a JSON file named `settings.json` within the project root and load its content into the `settings` variable.

6. **Get project documentation:** It attempts to open a Markdown file named `README.MD` within the project root and read its contents into the `doc_str` variable.

7. **Extract project details:** It extracts various project details (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, etc.) from the loaded `settings` dictionary and sets them into corresponding variables.  Default values are used if `settings` is not found or a key is missing.

8. **Return root path:** The function returns the project root directory.

9. **Set global project root:** The code calls the `set_project_root` function to get and set the project root into a global variable `__root__`.

10. **Import `gs`:** Imports the `gs` module.

11. **Handle potential errors:** Uses `try-except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during the file opening and loading processes. This prevents the script from crashing if the necessary files are missing or improperly formatted.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.bangood.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage (assuming you have a project structure with pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, settings.json, README.MD in appropriate directories):

    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Project documentation: {__doc__}")
