```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better reflect the specific scenario being tested.

2. **File Cleanup:** The code now removes the temporary files (`pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`) created in the tests to avoid issues with later tests and maintain a clean environment.  This is **crucial** for avoiding false positives.

3. **Edge Cases:**  The `test_set_project_root_marker_file_not_exists` test case specifically checks the situation where the marker files do not exist.

4. **Multiple Marker Files:** The `test_set_project_root_with_multiple_marker_files` test checks if the function correctly handles multiple marker files.


5. **System Path Consideration**: `test_set_project_root_already_in_path` now handles the case where the root path is already present in `sys.path`.

6. **Parent Directory Test:**  `test_set_project_root_in_parent_directory` test covers the case where the marker files are in the parent directory.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Real-World File Handling:**  The tests now assume that a valid file system exists. However, for production code, you should consider more robust checks for edge cases and scenarios where files might not exist or have unexpected contents.

* **Error Handling:**  The original code already has basic error handling for file I/O.  Your tests should thoroughly test those aspects: What happens if the file doesn't exist? What if the file is not valid JSON?  (The `try...except` blocks in the main code need to be covered.)


This revised answer provides more comprehensive test coverage and demonstrates best practices for writing reliable tests. Remember to add more tests to cover a wider range of scenarios.  Remember to adjust the test paths and file names if your project structure differs. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already.
