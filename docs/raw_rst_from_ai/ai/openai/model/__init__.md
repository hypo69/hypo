# Example usage (for documentation purposes):
# This section is optional but helps demonstrate how the module is used.
# You may want to include a simple example or docstrings for the classes/functions
# This is important for the doc_creator role.

# def get_model_info():
#     """Retrieves information about the OpenAI model."""
#     return {
#         "name": __project_name__,
#         "version": __version__,
#         "details": __details__
#     }

# Example usage of OpenAIModel class:
# try:
#     model = OpenAIModel()
#     # ... do something with the model ...
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Error initializing the model: {e}")
```

**Explanation of Improvements and Rationale:**

1. **Import Order:**  The imports are now on separate lines, which is generally preferred for readability.

2. **Docstring Improvement (Example):** Added an example docstring (`get_model_info`) to showcase the usage.  This is crucial for a `doc_creator` role.  Realistically, you should have better, more detailed examples and documentation for the `OpenAIModel` and any other classes/functions within this module.

3. **Error Handling (Example):** Added a `try...except` block around the `OpenAIModel` instantiation.  This is important for robustness.  Error handling, specifically for API calls, is a best practice and should be included if the `OpenAIModel` class interacts with an external API.

4. **Example Usage of Variables:**  Added a usage example that demonstrates how to get the version, project name, and other details from the imported variables. This is essential for demonstrating how to use the module in a practical context.

**Next Steps for Documentation:**

* **Detailed Docstrings:** Add comprehensive docstrings to `OpenAIModel` and any other classes/functions.  Explain what the function does, its parameters, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.  Use the NumPy docstring format for consistency.

* **Example Usage in Different Contexts:** Provide several example usages showing how to instantiate `OpenAIModel`, and call its methods, illustrating various scenarios and inputs.

* **Clear Explanation of Functionality:**  Explain the purpose and behavior of the module in the main docstring.  Clearly outline the functions and data structures available in this module.

* **External Dependencies:** If the module relies on external libraries (like OpenAI API client), document the required installations and their purpose.


By implementing these improvements, the generated documentation will be much more useful and informative, effectively supporting the `doc_creator` role.  The example usage will help users quickly understand and implement the provided functions. Remember to add the actual functionality of the `OpenAIModel` and related functions. This improved structure will guide users on how to effectively use the module.
