**Received Code**

```python
# \file hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/__init__.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
""" module: src.endpoints.hypo69 """
MODE = 'development'


from .code_assistant import CodeAssistant
from .small_talk_bot import bot as small_talk_bot
```

**Improved Code**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Module for endpoints related to hypo69.

This module provides access to code assistance and small talk bot functionalities.
"""
from .code_assistant import CodeAssistant
from .small_talk_bot import bot as small_talk_bot
from src.logger import logger


# Define the mode for the application.
MODE = 'development'


# Class for code assistance.  (This class will need its own documentation in the future.)
# ...


# Small talk bot. (This will also need its own documentation in the future.)
# ...


```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module docstring in RST format to describe the purpose of the module.
- Removed unnecessary shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python`).  These are handled by the system's environment variables and are not necessary in Python source code.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Added placeholder comments (`# ...`) for `CodeAssistant` and `small_talk_bot` classes.  Complete docstrings for those classes will be needed later.
