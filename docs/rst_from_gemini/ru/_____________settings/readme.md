""" Global Project Settings: paths, passwords, logins, and API settings.  
This module, `settings.py`, manages critical configuration settings, including paths, passwords, logins, and API keys.  It's crucial for the application's operation and security.  Sensitive information is stored securely within a KeePass database for access control.


## `credentials.py` Module

The `credentials.py` module centralizes the management of sensitive configuration settings and credentials essential for the application.  It ensures secure and consistent access to paths, passwords, logins, and API keys across the entire project.

### Overview

The `ProjectSettings` class, implemented as a singleton, manages and stores all critical project settings and credentials.  The singleton pattern guarantees a single instance, maintaining consistency throughout the application.

### Features

1. **Singleton Pattern**: The `SingletonMeta` metaclass enforces the singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of `ProjectSettings` is created and used throughout the application. This guarantees consistent configuration data.

2. **Configuration Management**:  The module defines key project file paths and directories using `Path` objects for cross-platform compatibility.

3. **Credentials Storage**: Sensitive information, including API keys, passwords, and other credentials for services like Aliexpress, OpenAI, Telegram, Discord, Prestashop, SMTP, Facebook, translation services, and Google APIs, are securely loaded from a KeePass database (`db.kdbx`).

4. **Path Definitions**:  The module manages paths for essential project directories (root, source, binary, log, temporary, cookie, and external data).  Uses `Path` objects for cross-platform compatibility.

5. **Initialization and Loading**: The `__init__` method initializes the settings and loads credentials from the KeePass database via `_load_credentials()`. The `_open_kp()` method attempts to open the KeePass database with retry logic in case of initial failures.

6. **Credential Loading Methods**: Methods exist to load credentials for specific services:
    - `_load_{service}_credentials()`: Loads credentials for each supported service.


### Usage with `gs`

The `gs` object (typically accessed via an `__init__.py` module) provides access to the `ProjectSettings` singleton:

```python
from __init__ import gs

# Access Aliexpress API credentials
aliexpress_credentials = gs.credentials.aliexpress
api_key = aliexpress_credentials.api_key
```

### Notes

- **KeePass Database**: Credentials are stored in a KeePass database (`db.kdbx`) located in `src/settings/`.  The KeePass master password is required to access the database.
- **Cross-OS Compatibility**: Paths are handled using `Path` objects from the `pathlib` module, guaranteeing consistency across different operating systems.
- **Error Handling**: The `_open_kp()` method includes retry logic and error logging for robust KeePass database interaction.
- **Customization**:  While the root directory is currently hardcoded, future improvements should explore configurable root directory names via a configuration file.


### Installation

Install the necessary `pykeepass` library:

```bash
pip install pykeepass
```

### Example Usage (from `main.py` or another module)

```python
from __init__ import gs
log_path = gs.path.log
# ... access other settings
```


### Project Structure


```
project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── settings/
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── credentials.py
│   │   └── db.kdbx
│   ├── utils/
│   └── logger.py
└── main.py
```

This structure clearly separates settings and credentials from the main application code.  The `db.kdbx` file is critical; its location should be explicitly documented in the project's `README.md`.
