**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Input Code:** The provided input code is empty (only comments).  This example demonstrates how to write tests *given* a set of functions. You *must* replace the dummy functions and fixtures with the actual code from your `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_pytest/test_firefox.py` file.

2. **`MODE` Variable:** The code tests the `MODE` variable, which is a constant. This shows how to test simple variables.

3. **Exception Handling:** The `test_function_that_raises_exception` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions.  Crucially, you need to replace the placeholder `raise ValueError(...)` with the actual function call that is expected to raise the exception.

4. **Fixtures:** The `example_data` fixture demonstrates how to use fixtures if needed. Replace the placeholder data and function usage with the actual usage from your code.  This is essential for isolating tests and ensuring data is managed properly.

5. **Test Coverage:** The tests provided above are basic examples.  To create truly comprehensive tests, you need to consider different input values, edge cases, and error conditions specific to the functions in your code.


**How to Use This Example:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Update the `test_function_that_raises_exception` function, and the `test_function_using_fixture` function with the actual code from the `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_pytest/test_firefox.py` module.  If your functions are more complex, create more tests!  For example, test different values for inputs, boundary conditions, and expected results in the tests.

2. **Run pytest:** Save the code above (with the appropriate file name and modifications) in a file, such as `test_firefox.py`. Run `pytest test_firefox.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.


**Important:** Thoroughly test the actual functionality in your file `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_pytest/test_firefox.py`.  The example provided here is a starting point to help you structure your testing but doesn't test your real code. Remember to test valid and invalid inputs and edge cases to ensure the code works correctly under all circumstances. Remember to use `pytest.raises` for exception testing.
