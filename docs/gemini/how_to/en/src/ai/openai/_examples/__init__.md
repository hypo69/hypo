How to use the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py` module

This module, located at `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py`, appears to be part of a larger project (likely a Python application).  Its primary purpose, as indicated by the comments, is to define some constants and potentially import classes/functions from the `_examples` subdirectory.  However, the current file content is incomplete and contains redundant documentation strings.


**Key Points & Issues:**

* **Incomplete:** The file is marked as an `__init__.py` file, which means it's the entry point for the `_examples` package.  Crucially, the file is unfinished, ending with `...` and implying the existence of other classes and functions that are missing.  Without the rest of the file, a complete usage guide is impossible.

* **Redundant Documentation:** The file contains multiple docstrings with the same or very similar platform and synopsis information. This is inefficient and should be consolidated into a single, clear description.

* **`MODE = 'dev'` Variable:**  The variable `MODE` is assigned the string 'dev'.  This is a configuration variable.  How this variable is used is critical to its purpose.  More context is needed to understand its role.


**How to use it (after completion):**

1. **Import the module:**  Assuming the `_examples` directory contains Python modules, you'd import them using standard Python import syntax:

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples import <module_name>
   ```

   Replace `<module_name>` with the actual name of the module you want to use from the `_examples` package.


2. **Access Constants/Classes/Functions:** Once imported, you can access the defined constants, classes, and functions from the module.

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples import MyExampleClass, example_function, MY_CONSTANT

   # Accessing a class
   my_object = MyExampleClass()
   my_object.my_method()

   # Accessing a function
   result = example_function(arguments)

   # Accessing a constant
   print(MY_CONSTANT)
   ```


3. **Understanding `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`:** The code imports `Version` from `packaging.version`, and likely `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from within the `_examples` directory (likely an `__init__.py` or a specific module within this directory).  These likely represent versioning information, documentation string, and potentially implementation details for the module.  Knowing the specifics of how these variables are populated will determine how to leverage them in your application.



**Critical Missing Information:**

To provide a useful usage guide, please provide the complete code for the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py` file. This would include any function definitions, class implementations, and variables beyond `MODE = 'dev'`.


**Example (hypothetical, incomplete):**

```python
# ... (other imports)

from .my_example_module import MyExampleClass

# ... (other code)
```

This snippet shows an example of how the module would be used.  A completed example would require the file contents for `my_example_module.py`.
