## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Added comprehensive docstrings to functions, methods, and the module using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Replaced vague comments with specific descriptions.
- Wrapped all critical code sections (`save_text_file`, `read_text_file`, `get_filenames`, `get_directory_names`) with `try...except` blocks, logging errors with `logger.error` instead of relying on implicit `try...except` blocks throughout the functions.
- Replaced instances of `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` as requested.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `mock_logger`, `mock_file_open`).
- Docstrings were updated to align with RST format and include examples.
- Added `:raises Exception` to the docstrings of functions that might raise exceptions.
