**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `Driver.get_url` method and the `logger.info` method.  This isolates the tests from external dependencies (e.g., actually accessing a Facebook page). This is critical for proper unit testing.

2. **`facebook_promoter` fixture:** A fixture is introduced to create the `FacebookPromoter` instance with mocked objects for Driver and logger.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now include more scenarios like empty `campaigns` and handling exceptions during campaign processing.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `test_run_campaigns_exception` test is added to verify that the `try...except` block in the original code correctly handles potential errors.

5. **KeyboardInterrupt Handling:** The `test_run_campaigns_interrupted` test covers the `KeyboardInterrupt` handling.

6. **Missing `run_campaign` Tests:**  The most critical addition is the comment reminding you to write tests for the `run_campaign` method *within* `FacebookPromoter`.  The `run_campaign` method is where the actual Facebook interaction occurs and must be tested thoroughly.  The provided example tests don't check that, which is a crucial gap.


**How to proceed:**

You need to add tests for the `run_campaign` method, mocking the necessary interactions (e.g., simulating calls to Facebook APIs, interactions with the browser, etc.)  Without testing `run_campaign`, the higher-level `run_campaigns` test doesn't fully validate the logic and could hide critical bugs.  **This is the essential next step to complete the testing.**

Remember to replace the placeholder comments in `run_campaign` with appropriate mocks. For example:

```python
# ... (Inside the FacebookPromoter class)

def run_campaign(self, campaign_name, filenames):
    # ... (your original code)
    # ... (MOCK the Facebook interaction) ...
    # Example: Simulate posting to a group
    if campaign_name == 'brands':
        return True  # Simulate success
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to run campaign")
```

Then create appropriate tests (similar in structure) to verify that these simulated actions (like posting to a group) work as expected.  The mock would allow you to test different scenarios and error conditions without the actual Facebook interaction.
