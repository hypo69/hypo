```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Added placeholder imports for the classes from `hypotez.src.endpoints`. Replace these placeholders with the actual imports if you have the relevant `.py` files.

2. **Fixtures:** Included example fixtures (`example_prestashop_instance`, `example_kazarinov_instance`).  These fixtures are critical for isolating tests and avoid creating new objects repeatedly in each test method.   Replace the example `PrestaShop()` instantiation with appropriate setup if needed.

3. **`pytest.raises`:**  Used `pytest.raises(TypeError)` in the example to test for a `TypeError`. This is crucial for exception handling.  Change this to the appropriate exception raised by the method you are testing if it raises a different exception.

4. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  Added basic tests for `PrestaShop` creation, mode attribute,  `KazarinovTelegramBot` creation, and `PriceListRequester` creation.

6. **Placeholder for Other Classes:** Added a comment to highlight the need to add more tests for the other classes (`PrestaCustomer`, `PrestaLanguage`, etc.) and their methods.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_endpoints.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_endpoints.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Update the imports and fixtures with the actual imports and data from your code.
- **Add Tests for Methods:**  Most importantly, *add tests for methods* of each class. These tests will check the behavior of the methods (e.g., `send_message`, other methods that might be present in `PrestaShop`, etc.)
- **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** Add tests for boundary cases and unexpected inputs to cover various situations.
- **Error Handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to ensure that the code handles exceptions correctly.

By filling in these details, you'll create comprehensive and robust tests for your `hypotez.src.endpoints` code. Remember to adapt the examples to reflect the actual structure and behavior of your code.
