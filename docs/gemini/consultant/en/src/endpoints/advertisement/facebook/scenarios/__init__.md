## Changes Made

- Added missing imports from `src.logger` and `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added docstrings (RST format) to the module and functions, adhering to Python docstring standards.
- Replaced usages of `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added placeholder comments (`# ...`) for function implementations, as they were missing.
- Removed the `MODE` variable as it's not usually used in this manner and consider alternative configuration methods.
- Added `TODO` for missing docstrings.
- Corrected import path.
