**Changes Made:**

- Added type hints (e.g., `-> Path`) to the `get_project_root` function.
- Docstrings were converted to reStructuredText format.
- Added `:type` and `:raises` sections to docstrings for better documentation.
- Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` to handle the JSON files properly, according to the prompt's requirement.
- Added a `try...except` block around the loading of `settings.json` to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- The problematic `__root__` assignment is fixed. This variable should be given the value from the function return.
- Improved error handling by printing error messages and providing default values when loading fails. This makes the code more robust.  
- Added missing `encoding='utf-8'` when reading `README.MD` for correct encoding support.
- Docstring improvements.

These changes improve the code's readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Note that the default values for `settings` and `doc_str` are critical. If the files are not found, these defaults avoid potential errors.  Also, the `try...except` structure now provides more informative feedback.  The return type of `get_project_root` was added for consistency with other functions.  Corrected handling of the `sys.path` insertion.
