settings: dict = None

try:
    with open('../settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")  # Add error handling


__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''
__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''  # Fixed typo
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` and prints an informative error message.  This is crucial for robustness.  The `...` was replaced with more useful error handling.
* **Typo Correction:**  The `copyrihgnt` key in the settings file is now correctly `copyright`.
* **Explicit Type Hinting:** The code now uses type hinting.  This is good practice, even if the interpreter doesn't enforce it in every case.


**How to Use:**

This file (`version.py`) should be used in other Python scripts in your project that need to access the version information. For instance:

```python
import hypotez.src.ai.version as version

print(version.__version__)
```

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Amazing Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, Acme Corp",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

* **`settings.json` Location:** The `settings.json` file is assumed to be located in the directory *above* `version.py`.  Adjust the `'../settings.json'` path if it's in a different location.

* **`__version__` Best Practice:**  Avoid using `__version__: str = ...` for simple string assignments like this.  Just use `__version__ = ...`. The explicit type hint isn't critical for Python.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  Your program should not crash if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted.  Proper error handling makes your program more reliable.

* **`print` statements:**  When debugging, use the `print` statements to understand where the problem is occurring. This can be especially useful if the error is hidden deep within the program.

By following these improvements, you'll have a more robust and maintainable way to handle version information in your project. Remember to replace the example `settings.json` content with the actual values for your project. Remember to put this file in the `hypotez/src/ai` directory.
