**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, like `test_dir_root_calculation`.

2. **Simulated Project Structure:** The tests now use a temporary directory (`test_cwd`) to simulate the project structure correctly, preventing unintended side effects on the real file system. This is crucial for isolated testing.

3. **Error Handling (`try...finally`):**  Critically, the code now uses `try...finally` blocks to ensure that the temporary directory is reset (`os.chdir`) after each test, avoiding directory conflicts and ensuring that subsequent tests run on the intended initial environment.

4. **Import and reload issues:** I removed the `reload` attempt in the test. Re-importing the module is a bad practice and potentially very risky, since it could override changes made by other tests. The tests are now designed to be self-contained and work correctly without modification to the module.

5. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover the critical aspects of the code, addressing the calculation of `dir_root` and `dir_src`.

6. **Exception Handling:** Tests include checks that the code does not crash when run, as well as checks that the values are correct in the output. This covers both valid and invalid inputs.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `header.py`.
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution provides more reliable and robust tests for the `header.py` file. Remember to adapt the `test_cwd` variable to match your actual project directory structure if it is different. Also, if the code needs to deal with paths in a particular way (e.g., absolute vs. relative paths), you should adjust the expected values in the tests to match these requirements.
