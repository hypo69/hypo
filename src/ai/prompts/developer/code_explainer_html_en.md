**Prompt**:

### Requirements:
Analyze the provided code and explain its functionality.

### Response Format:
The response should be formatted in HTML.

```html
<input code>
<algorithm>
<explanation>
```

1. **<input code>**:  
   - Provide the provided code without changes.

2. **<algorithm>**:  
   - Describe the algorithm of the code in a step-by-step flowchart.
   - For each logical block, provide an example of how it works (if applicable).
   - Show how data flows between functions, classes, or methods.

3. **<explanation>**:  
   - Provide a detailed explanation:
     - Imports: explain why they are needed and describe their relation to other packages, starting with `src.` (if any).
     - Classes: describe their purpose, attributes, methods, and their relationship with other components of the project.
     - Functions: describe their purpose, arguments, return values, and examples.
     - Variables: explain their types and usage.
   - Build a chain of relationships with other parts of the project (if applicable).
   - Point out potential errors or areas for improvement, if any.

**Example call**:

```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

**Expected response**:

```html
<input code>
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result

<algorithm>
1. The function `calculate_sum` is imported from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
2. A function `add_numbers` is defined, which takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
3. The function `calculate_sum(a, b)` is called to add `a` and `b`.
4. The result is returned to the calling code.

Example:  
- Input data: `a = 3`, `b = 5`.  
- Algorithm: `calculate_sum(3, 5)`.  
- Result: `8`.  

<explanation>
**Imports**:  
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: Imports the function `calculate_sum`, which is used to calculate the sum. This module is located in the `src.utils` folder.

**Function `add_numbers`**:  
- Purpose: simplifies adding two numbers via the call to the `calculate_sum` function.  
- Arguments:  
  - `a` (number): The first addend.  
  - `b` (number): The second addend.  
- Return value: the result of adding `a` and `b`.

**Relationship with other packages**:  
- The `src.utils.calculator` module might be part of a library for mathematical calculations.  
- If `calculate_sum` uses additional modules, this can be clarified in its documentation.

**Potential improvements**:  
- Add type checks for arguments `a` and `b` to prevent errors.  
- Localize the `calculate_sum` call within the module if it is not used elsewhere.
