.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

## <algorithm>

**save_png_from_url:**

1. **HTTP Request:** Makes an asynchronous GET request to the provided `image_url` using `aiohttp`.
2. **Error Handling:** Catches potential exceptions during the download process and logs errors using the `logger`. Returns `None` if an error occurs.
3. **Image Data:** Reads the downloaded image data from the response.
4. **Saving:** Calls `save_png` to save the image data to the specified `filename`.
5. **Return:** Returns the path to the saved file if successful; `None` otherwise.

**save_png:**

1. **Path Handling:** Converts the `file_name` to a `Path` object for easier manipulation.
2. **Directory Creation:** Creates the necessary parent directories if they don't exist using `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
3. **File Writing:** Opens the file in binary write mode (`wb`) using `aiofiles` and writes the `image_data` to it.
4. **Error Handling:** Catches any exceptions during file writing and logs them with `logger`.
5. **File Existence Check:** Checks if the file was created and if its size is greater than zero (valid image).
6. **Image Processing:** Loads the image using PIL (`Image.open`) and resaves it in PNG format with PIL (`image.save`).
7. **Return:** Returns the path to the saved file if successful; `None` otherwise.


**get_image_data:**

1. **Path Check:** Checks if the file specified by `file_name` exists using `Path.exists()`.
2. **File Reading:** If the file exists, opens the file in binary read mode (`rb`) and reads its contents using the `with open()` statement.
3. **Error Handling:** Catches any exceptions during file reading and logs them with `logger`.
4. **Return:** Returns the binary data of the file if successful; `None` otherwise.

## <explanation>

### Imports

* `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client for downloading the image from the URL.
* `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file I/O for saving the image locally. Crucial for handling I/O operations asynchronously.
* `PIL (Pillow)`: Python Imaging Library for image manipulation, specifically handling PNG images.
* `Pathlib`: For handling file paths in an object-oriented way (avoiding string manipulation).
* `asyncio`: For running asynchronous operations.
* `logger`: Logging facility likely from the `src.logger` module. Provides structured logging capabilities.  This module manages logging and is crucial for debugging and monitoring tasks.
* `pprint`: Likely for pretty-printing, from `src.utils.printer`  module. This is not as critical as `logger` and usually used for debugging.  

### Classes

This module doesn't define any classes. Only functions are present.

### Functions

* `save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None`: Downloads an image from a URL and saves it as a PNG file locally using asyncio. Takes the URL and the desired filename as inputs, returns the file path or None if something goes wrong.
* `save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None`: Takes the binary image data and the desired filename, saves it as a PNG file, returns the file path or None if there's a problem, using asyncio and the PIL library.  Important to use asynchronous file writing (`aiofiles`) for better performance, especially when dealing with large files.
* `get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None`: Reads image data from a file and returns it as bytes. Takes the filename as input and returns the file data if it exists or `None` if it doesn't exist or an error occurs.  Crucially, this one is *not* asynchronous.

### Variables

* `MODE`: A string variable likely for specifying the development mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').


### Potential Errors/Improvements

* **Robust Error Handling:** While the code includes `try...except` blocks for error handling, more specific exception types could be caught (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `IOError`).  Logging exceptions using `exc_info=True` is great for debugging, but may be too much verbose information in production.
* **Input Validation:** Input validation for `image_url` (e.g., checking for valid URL format) and `filename` (e.g., preventing malicious characters) could be added.
* **File Existence:** The check for file existence and validation that `file_path` was actually created in `save_png` is potentially redundant.  A more robust approach might be to use `aiofiles` for asynchronous file operations throughout the whole process.
* **Concurrency:**  The code uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests and `aiofiles` for asynchronous file operations. This is good for handling multiple requests and file operations concurrently.  Potentially unnecessary to create another `asyncio` task within a `save_png` function if using a higher level concurrency structure.
* **Resource Management:** When `asyncio` is used, resources are managed properly. It would be helpful to use the `async with` statement for all resource-intensive operations, like file handling and HTTP requests.

### Relationships

This module interacts with `src.logger` for logging information (errors and messages), and with `src.utils.printer` for debugging, possibly.
