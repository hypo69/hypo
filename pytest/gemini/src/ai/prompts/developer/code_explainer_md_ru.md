**Explanation:**

The provided code has been expanded to include comprehensive test cases for the `add_numbers` function.

1.  **Test Cases:**
    *   `test_add_numbers_valid_input()`:  Tests the function with various positive, negative, and floating-point inputs, ensuring that the output is as expected.
    *   `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type()`:  Crucially tests the error handling for invalid inputs (non-numeric types).  `pytest.raises` is used to verify that the `TypeError` is raised in these cases. This is a *critical* test for robustness.
    *   `test_add_numbers_zero_input()`: This covers the specific edge case of zero input.
    *   `test_add_numbers_large_input()`: Tests for potential integer overflow issues, though this specific function is unlikely to overflow.


2.  **Test Structure and Style:**
    *   Test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type`).
    *   Tests are isolated (each test operates independently).


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `add_numbers` function now includes error handling for non-numeric input, raising a `TypeError`.  This is crucial for writing robust code. The tests verify that the function correctly handles these exceptions.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover a wider range of input scenarios, including boundary conditions (zero, large numbers), valid inputs of different types, and invalid inputs that should raise exceptions.
* **Readability:** Test function names are clear and concise. Comments explain the purpose of each test.



**How to use the example:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code above (including the `add_numbers` function definition) into a Python file (e.g., `test_add_numbers.py`).
2.  **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests:

```bash
pytest test_add_numbers.py
```

This will execute the test cases and report the results.  If any test fails, the output will clearly show the error.


Remember to replace the example `add_numbers` function with the actual code you want to test.  Provide the code in the `input_code` section so I can generate appropriate test cases for your code.
