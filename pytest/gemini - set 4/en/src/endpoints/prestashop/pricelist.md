**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `PrestaShop` API. This is crucial for testing the `PriceListRequester` class without needing an actual external API. This allows us to control the responses and avoid making real API calls.
* **Clearer Error Handling:** The tests now include specific error message checks to make sure the correct error is being raised when appropriate (e.g., `ValueError` for empty input, `TypeError` for incorrect input type). This is crucial for robust testing.
* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests cover valid input, empty input, invalid input types, and, critically, demonstrates *how* to check for expected errors in the `request_prices` function.
* **Missing Credentials:** A test `test_init_missing_credentials` has been added to handle the potential `KeyError` when initializing the `PriceListRequester` with missing credentials.
* **Fixture Structure:** The fixture for `mock_prestashop_api` is now well-structured, utilizing the `mock_api_credentials` fixture to provide the API credentials correctly.
* **`assert_called_once_with`:**  Crucial addition.  This verifies that the method *was called with the correct arguments.*   Without this, you don't know if the method was executed at all or with the wrong arguments.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the code (including the added tests) as a Python file (e.g., `test_pricelist.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_pricelist.py`.

This revised solution is significantly more robust and covers important aspects of testing, including error handling and mocking external dependencies.  Remember to adapt the fixtures and tests to precisely match the actual implementation of your `PrestaShop` class. Remember to adjust the `return` values in the fixtures to match the actual behaviour.  Remember that the `pass` statements in your `PriceListRequester` methods need to be replaced with actual implementation code for these tests to be fully functional.
