# Remember to mock the logger for proper testing of logging behavior.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`test_custom_exception_logging`:** This test now effectively mocks the logger using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`.  It asserts that the `logger.error` method was called with the expected message, crucial for verifying the logging functionality.  It also now captures output and checks if the expected message was printed to the console using `capsys`.
* **`test_custom_exception_creation`:** Added a test for creation with an original exception.
* **`test_file_not_found_error` , `test_product_field_exception`**: Added basic tests for these exception types.  Crucially, they verify inheritance from `CustomException`.
* **`test_prestashop_exception_creation` and `test_prestashop_exception_custom_msg`:** Added comprehensive tests for `PrestaShopException`.  The latter shows how to check if the custom error message is used when `ps_error_msg` is provided.
* **`test_prestashop_authentication_error`:**  Added a test to ensure proper inheritance.
* **Import Statements:** The imports are now corrected and explicit, making the tests more robust.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more specific, verifying the correct attributes and types of the exceptions.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings are added to all test functions for better documentation.
* **Mocking:** The `MagicMock` is used to mock the logger, preventing actual logging to the console during testing.  This is standard practice in Python unit testing.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code as `test_exceptions.py` (or a similar name) in a directory in the same level as `hypotez/src/logger/exceptions.py`.
3.  Run `pytest test_exceptions.py` from your terminal.


Remember to add similar tests for the other exception types (`KeePassException`, `DefaultSettingsException`, etc.) in the `hypotez/src` directory.  You might need to adapt the mocking depending on the specific classes you're testing.  For exceptions that involve external dependencies (like KeePass or Selenium), consider using mocks for those as well.
