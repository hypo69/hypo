**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The tests now effectively mock the `Driver` object and `Context` object, crucial for isolating the `Graber` class from external dependencies.  This is vital because the tests were trying to interact with real webdrivers.
* **`pytest.fixture`:**  `mock_driver` and `graber` are now fixtures, improving test organization and readability.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init`, `test_graber_locator_decorator`).
* **Targeted Tests:**  The test `test_close_popup_decorator` now correctly tests the decorator *in isolation*, mocking the crucial Context parts.
* **Handles `close_pop_up` Scenario**: The test `test_graber_close_popup_decorator_not_used` verifies the scenario where `Context.locator_for_decorator` is not used.
* **Example Graber Method Testing (Crucial):**  I've added `test_graber_close_popup_decorator_not_used`. This is a vital addition because it directly tests whether the `graber` class handles the case where the `Context.locator_for_decorator` is not set.  Without this, you're not fully testing the class's behavior.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_graber.py
    ```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Complete Mock-up:** The `test_graber_close_popup_decorator_not_used` test is the most crucial, as it demonstrates the "not used" scenario.  Without it, the tests are incomplete and will not find a potential bug.
* **Actual `Graber` Method:** Replace the placeholder comments in the test with appropriate calls to methods of the Graber class if there are methods that use the `@close_pop_up` decorator. This will enable comprehensive testing of your class's logic.
* **Error Handling:** Add more tests to verify the correct handling of potential exceptions (e.g., `ExecuteLocatorException`).


Remember to adapt the imports to match your actual file structure.  Always mock external dependencies that are not part of the unit under test (in this case, `Context` and `Driver`).  This is fundamental to proper unit testing.
