```
Changes Made
```
- Added a module-level docstring in RST format explaining the purpose of the `tryxpath` namespace.
- Added a comment explaining the purpose of the `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` variable.
- Replaced any `//` style comments with `/* */` style comments to maintain compatibility with JS.
- Added a comment explaining that the variable `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` is a placeholder needing further implementation.
- Corrected typo in the `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` variable comment.


```
