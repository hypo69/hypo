```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are defined in the input code, so there are no tests to write.
# The provided text is a content strategy document, not Python code.

#  Therefore, this file remains empty as there's no code to test.
#  If you provide Python code, I will generate appropriate pytest tests.
