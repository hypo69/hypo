**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_project_root` and `mock_project_root_missing` fixtures to create temporary directories for testing, ensuring isolated test environments and clean-up.  Crucially,  `mock_project_root_missing` is included to test the case where the marker files are *not* found.  This was a major gap in the previous response.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more explicitly describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).

3. **Edge Cases:** Added a test for the situation where the marker file is in the parent directory and another test specifically for when the script is already at the project root.


4. **Exception Handling (Implicit):**  The original code already handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the `set_project_root` function.


5. **Cleanup:** Added `os.remove` to clean up the created temporary files after each test to prevent conflicts.


6. **`pytest` Imports:** Added `import pytest` at the top, which is necessary for `pytest` functionality.


7. **`tmp_path` Fixture (for better testing):**  Replaced the manual directory creation with pytest's `tmp_path` fixture for cleaner, more reliable test setup and teardown. This avoids having to manually delete files after each test.   I've included examples of how to use `tmp_path` correctly.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing `test_header.py`.


This improved solution provides more comprehensive, robust, and maintainable test cases for the provided code. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Also, ensure that `packaging` is installed.
