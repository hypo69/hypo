**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `save_text_file`:**  Crucially, the tests now use `@patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `save_text_file` function. This prevents the actual file saving operation, which is important for testability.  The assertions now verify that the correct content is *passed* to `save_text_file`, not that it was saved to a file.

* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now directly compare the expected HTML content (which now includes proper escaping) against the content that was passed to `save_text_file`.


* **Validating File Path:** The tests now directly check that `save_text_file` was called with the correct file path. This prevents accidental failures where the file wasn't saved with the expected name.  Example: `assert str(Path(category_path).joinpath("html", "123.html")) in save_text_file.call_args[0][1]`


* **Edge Case Testing:** I've added a `test_set_category_html_single_product` test case to handle the scenario where a single product (instead of a list) is passed to `set_category_html`.  This was an important edge case missing in the initial response.


* **Fixtures for Data:** Fixtures are now properly used to create the required `SimpleNamespace` objects for products and category paths.  The example usage `product_list` fixture was not present in the initial reply but is now implemented correctly


* **Parameterization (Important):** For a truly comprehensive test suite, you'd want to use parameterization (e.g., with `pytest.mark.parametrize`) to test with different product data, category paths, and potentially different input types (e.g., strings vs. `Path` objects)


* **Missing Data:** The `categories` fixture was absent, so a placeholder `categories = ["electronics"]` is added. In a real application, this should be a fixture providing the actual category data.  Likewise, a test that demonstrates an `invalid` product object should be part of the tests.


This improved solution provides much better testability for the functions, as it directly verifies the correct data is being constructed for saving to a file, and will now correctly detect many errors, since the mocking is included.  It also addresses the issues with single product handling and missing data. Remember to replace the placeholder data (like `categories`) with the actual data your functions will receive.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code in a file named, for example, `test_html_generators.py`.
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using:  `pytest test_html_generators.py`
