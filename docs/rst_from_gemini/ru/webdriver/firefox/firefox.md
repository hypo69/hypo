# File: hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/firefox.py

This Python file defines a custom `Firefox` WebDriver class, extending the `selenium.webdriver.Firefox` class to offer enhanced functionality, specifically for launching Firefox in kiosk mode and managing Firefox profiles.

## Functionality

The `Firefox` class provides the following enhancements:

* **Kiosk Mode (Implicit):** While not explicitly mentioned as a primary feature, the code likely sets up options for kiosk mode via `options.add_argument()`. This is inferred because setting kiosk mode is a common WebDriver configuration task.

* **Profile Management:** Allows creating and using custom Firefox profiles (`profile_name` parameter).

* **Geckodriver and Firefox Version Control:**  The `geckodriver_version` and `firefox_version` parameters enable the user to specify specific versions of these components if needed.

* **User Agent Customization:** Accepts a `user_agent` dictionary to potentially customize the user agent string sent by the browser.

* **Configuration Loading:** Loads configuration settings from a `firefox.json` file, potentially managing various options, paths, and other settings for the WebDriver. This is beneficial for code maintainability and configuration flexibility.

* **Error Handling:** Includes `try...except` blocks to catch `WebDriverException` and other exceptions during WebDriver initialization, providing more robust error handling and logging.

* **Integration with Other Modules:**  Interacts with `src.webdriver.executor`, `src.webdriver.javascript.js`, `src.utils`, and `src.logger`, indicating its role as part of a larger system.

* **Helper Functions:** The `normilize_path` function, while a bit problematic in terms of naming and validation, handles path normalization for potentially variable locations.

## Usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    profile_name = "custom_profile"
    geckodriver_version = "0.30.0"  # Example version
    firefox_version = "123.0"  # Example version

    browser = Firefox(profile_name=profile_name, geckodriver_version=geckodriver_version, firefox_version=firefox_version)
    browser.get("https://www.example.com")
    browser.quit()
```

## Improvements Needed

* **`normilize_path` function:** The name should be `normalize_path`, and the function should be more robust. It should validate the input and handle missing environment variables gracefully. Also, it's important to validate the path format, checking for invalid characters.
* **Error Handling in `normilize_path`:** The function should include appropriate error handling for cases where the environment variables are not defined.
* **`if __name__ == "main"` block:** This block should be moved outside the class definition. The code should initialize `driver` within this block, instead of within the class definition as this is an instance method and not immediately callable.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Add more informative error messages to the `try...except` block for `WebDriverException` to give users more helpful information about potential problems.
* **`profile_name` Parameter Handling:** Add validation or a more descriptive error message if `profile_name` is invalid.
* **`user_agent` Parameter:**  Add a more descriptive comment or specification about the format of the `user_agent` dictionary.
* **Documentation Improvements:** Add type hints to parameters and return values. Provide a better explanation of the `firefox.json` file structure (e.g., required keys, data types).  Mention which options are supported for kiosk mode.
* **Import Order:** Improve the import order for better code style and readability.

By addressing these points, the code will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to use.
