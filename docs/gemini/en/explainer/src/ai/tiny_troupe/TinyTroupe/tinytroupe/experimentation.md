# Code Explanation: experimentation.py

**<input code>**

```python
import random
import pandas as pd
from tinytroupe.agent import TinyPerson

class ABRandomizer():
    # ... (rest of the code)
```

**<algorithm>**

The code defines a class `ABRandomizer` for randomizing and de-randomizing choices between two options (e.g., treatment and control).  It stores the randomization choices and allows for specifying items that should not be randomized.

1. **Initialization (`__init__`):**
   - Takes parameters for real names of options, corresponding blind names for the user, and a list of items that shouldn't be randomized.
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `self.choices` to store randomization assignments.
   - Stores the provided names and the random seed.


2. **Randomization (`randomize`):**
   - Takes the index `i` and the two options `a` and `b`.
   - Generates a random number using the provided `random_seed`.
   - If the random number is less than 0.5, it assigns `(0, 1)` to the index `i` in `self.choices` (meaning 'a' is assigned to index `i`) and returns `a`, `b`.
   - Otherwise, it assigns `(1, 0)` to `self.choices[i]` (meaning 'b' is assigned to index `i`) and returns `b`, `a`.

3. **Derandomization (`derandomize`):**
   - Takes the index `i` and the two options `a` and `b`.
   - Retrieves the randomization assignment from `self.choices[i]`.
   - Based on the assignment, returns the original pair `a`, `b`, or `b`, `a`, respectively. Raises an exception if the index is not found.

4. **Decoding User Choices (`derandomize_name`):**
   - Takes the index `i` and the user's choice.
   - Based on the randomization assignment for that index, returns the corresponding original real name.
   - Handles cases where the user's choice is not one of the randomized pairs (passing through).
   - Raises an exception if the choice is unrecognized.

**Explanation of dependencies and imports:**
- `random`: Provides pseudo-random number generation capabilities, crucial for the randomization process.
- `pandas as pd`: Likely for data manipulation (though the code itself doesn't directly use it in a substantial way).
- `tinytroupe.agent.TinyPerson`: This indicates a relationship to another part of the `tinytroupe` project. It likely defines a class `TinyPerson` which is related to agents.


**<explanation>**


**Imports:**

- `random`: Used for generating random numbers to determine which option (e.g., treatment or control) is assigned to a given item.
- `pandas as pd`:  This is standard import, providing data manipulation tools.  Its use in this particular script is minimal, though it likely exists in this file for general data manipulation purposes within the project.
- `tinytroupe.agent`: Imports `TinyPerson` (or an equivalent agent class), implying a modular design where `ABRandomizer` interacts with agent entities defined in another module within the `tinytroupe` package.

**Classes:**

- `ABRandomizer`: This class encapsulates the logic for randomizing and de-randomizing between two options ('A' and 'B'). It provides methods to manage the randomization process and handle situations where items should be treated as 'passthrough' (meaning they are not randomized).


**Functions:**

- `__init__`: Initializes the `ABRandomizer` object, setting up the mapping between real/blind names and passing through names.
- `randomize`: Randomly assigns one of the two options to an item based on a given random seed.
- `derandomize`: Restores the original assignments from a given item index.
- `derandomize_name`: Takes the blind name choice, retrieves the corresponding real name based on the randomization decision in `self.choices` and handles cases where items should be treated as pass-through.


**Variables:**

- `self.choices`: A dictionary storing the randomization assignments (key: item index, value: a tuple indicating the randomized ordering).
- `self.real_name_1`, `self.real_name_2`, etc.: Store the real and blind names used for randomization.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**


- **Exception Handling:** While the code includes exception handling, consider more specific exception types for better error messages (e.g., `ValueError` for invalid input types).


- **Data Validation:**  Adding validation to check for the correct types and lengths of input parameters (especially `passtrough_name`) could prevent unexpected behavior.  For example, `passtrough_name` should be a list, not a string.


- **Random Seed:** The use of `random.Random(self.random_seed)` creates a new instance of `random.Random` for every call.  This is good for reproducibility, but if you are calling `randomize` frequently on a single seed, the initialization becomes somewhat inefficient. If you need to call `randomize` repeatedly, consider generating random values only once and storing them in a temporary variable.


**Relationship to other parts:**

`ABRandomizer` relies on `TinyPerson` (from `tinytroupe.agent`) which suggests that this class is part of a larger project focused on agents, likely for running experiments on these agents. The use of `pandas` suggests that data handling and analysis are core features of the `tinytroupe` project.
