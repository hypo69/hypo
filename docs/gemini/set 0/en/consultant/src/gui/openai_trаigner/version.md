# Changes Made

*   Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`
*   Added import `import logging`
*   Replaced `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12` with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. This is a better way to specify the interpreter for Python scripts, making them more portable.
*   Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` for centralized logging.
*   Added RST-style docstrings for module, variables, and constants.  
*   Corrected the `MODE` variable to be a string literal and added a docstring to clarify the variable's purpose.
*   Corrected typo in file name (`trаigner` -> `trainer`).
*   Improved the copyright information by using a multiline string and adding a link.
