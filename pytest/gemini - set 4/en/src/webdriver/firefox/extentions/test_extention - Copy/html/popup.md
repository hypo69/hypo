```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test was provided in the input.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.
# If there was Python code, the tests would go here.


# Example of how to write tests if there was Python code.
# Assume a function exists in popup.py (the likely actual source)
# def greet(name):
#     return f"Hello, {name}!"


# Example test cases (replace with actual tests based on the Python code)
# @pytest.mark.parametrize("name, expected_output", [
#     ("Alice", "Hello, Alice!"),
#     ("Bob", "Hello, Bob!"),
#     ("Charlie", "Hello, Charlie!"),
# ])
# def test_greet_valid_input(name, expected_output):
#     """Tests the greet function with valid input."""
#     assert greet(name) == expected_output


# @pytest.mark.parametrize("invalid_name", [None, "", 123])
# def test_greet_invalid_input(invalid_name):
#     """Tests the greet function with invalid input (None, empty string, integer)."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         greet(invalid_name)


# # Example test for edge cases (if applicable):
# def test_greet_empty_string():
#     """Tests the greet function with an empty string."""
#     assert greet("") == "Hello, !" # or appropriate error handling

# def test_greet_special_characters():
#   """Tests the greet function with special characters."""
#   assert greet("David!") == "Hello, David!"
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) doesn't contain any Python code.  Therefore, there's nothing to test.  

* **Crucial:** To write meaningful tests, you *must* provide the Python code that corresponds to the HTML file.  The HTML is likely a frontend (user interface) element, while the Python code (likely in a file named `popup.py` or similar) handles backend logic.  The tests should verify that the Python code functions correctly, not the HTML itself.

* **Example Structure:** The example tests above show a `greet` function (replace this with the actual function from your Python code) and demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling and `pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple input cases.  Adapt the example parameters to match your actual function's inputs and expected outputs.

* **Edge Cases and Error Handling:**  Always consider edge cases, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions.  Test scenarios like empty strings, special characters, incorrect data types, and situations where expected outputs might be unusual or require special handling.

* **Fixture Definitions:** If your Python code relies on data or resources (e.g., file paths, database connections, etc.), you might need fixtures to provide them consistently to your test functions. Example fixtures are shown in the initial prompt and the answer.

* **Clear and Descriptive Names:** The test function names should clearly indicate the purpose of each test.  `test_greet_valid_input`, `test_greet_invalid_input`, and so on, are examples.


Once you provide the Python code, I can generate accurate and comprehensive `pytest` tests tailored to that specific code. Remember to replace the placeholder example with your actual function and logic.
