        logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")



```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format, providing a clear description of the module's purpose.
- Added an import statement for the `logger` from `src.logger` which will be used for proper error handling and logging in the future.
- Replaced the shebangs (`#! ...`) with a comment to avoid potential issues with the code execution. It's generally better to handle these directives at a higher level.
- Added example function and some RST docstrings.
