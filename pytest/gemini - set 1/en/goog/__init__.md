```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names (e.g., `test_mode_is_development`) clearly indicate what each test is verifying.

2. **Isolation:** Each test function is self-contained and doesn't rely on the state of other tests.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage (Important):** The provided code only defines `MODE` and a class `SpreadSheet`.  Crucially, there are no *methods* or *functions* within `SpreadSheet` to test. The example tests show how to structure tests for a class *if* methods existed.

4. **Exception Handling (Crucial):** The example test `test_spreadsheet_init` demonstrates how to handle exceptions during object creation.

5. **Fixtures (Optional):** Fixtures would be necessary if `SpreadSheet` required data to be initialized or modified for testing.


**How to Run These Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_goog.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_goog.py
   ```


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing (if you had real methods):**

* **Mocking:** If `SpreadSheet` interacts with external resources (like files), you should mock those interactions to isolate the tests and avoid side effects.  Use the `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` libraries for this.

* **Data Generation:** In real-world cases, you often need test dataâ€”valid, invalid, and edge cases.  Use a `pytest` fixture to generate and manage this data.

* **Realistic Test Cases:**  The example `test_spreadsheet_method_example` lacks specifics. You need to define *what* `get_data()` should return for different scenarios.  Real tests need to verify expected outputs for various input data and edge conditions.

* **Error Handling:** Test how the `SpreadSheet` handles invalid input (e.g., a file that doesn't exist, or data in the file that doesn't match the expected format).


By addressing these points, you'll write tests that provide much more comprehensive and reliable coverage of your code. Remember, robust tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness and maintainability of your codebase. Remember to adapt the example tests to reflect the specific methods and functionality of your `SpreadSheet` class.
