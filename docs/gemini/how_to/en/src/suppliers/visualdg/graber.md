.. module: src.suppliers.visualdg
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect product field values from the `visualdg.co.il` website.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    If non-standard processing is needed, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To use the decorator, pass a value to `Context.locator`.
    If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator definition and redefine its behavior.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Structure:** The code is now structured with a dedicated `fetch_all_data` function. This significantly improves readability and maintainability, especially as you add more fields.

2. **Driver Instance:** The `self.d = driver` line is crucial inside `grab_page`.  It ensures the `driver` object is accessible within the nested asynchronous functions (e.g., `fetch_all_data`).  Using a global `d` variable is a bad idea for async code; it's better to use the object's own variable (`self.d`).


3. **Placeholder for Field Functions:** The `# ... (All other await self.XXX calls)` section is a placeholder.  You must implement the individual field-fetching functions (`self.id_product`, `self.name`, etc.) that are appropriate to extract data from the `visualdg.co.il` page.


4. **Robust Error Handling:** You still need error handling within your specific field functions.  Place `try...except` blocks around each individual `await self.XXX` call to catch any potential `ExecuteLocatorException` or other exceptions that might occur during the process of locating and extracting data.


5. **Clearer Comments:** Comments now better describe the purpose and usage of the functions and code sections, promoting understanding and maintainability.


6. **Avoid Global Variables:** The `global d` is removed because it's not necessary.  Now, `self.d` is used.  This is much better practice in an asynchronous context.


**How to Use and Important Considerations:**


- **Implement `self.id_product`, `self.name`, etc.:** These methods (e.g., `self.id_product()`, `self.name()`) need to be defined in this class (`Graber`) for your specific product page layout and elements. They will use the provided `self.d` driver to locate elements and extract data.


- **Error Handling (Crucial):** Add robust error handling (using `try...except` blocks) within each of these functions to catch any exceptions that might occur during the field extraction process. The original `ExecuteLocatorException` might not cover all cases.


- **Context:** Ensure that `Context.locator` is correctly initialized and populated with the necessary selectors and conditions before calling `grab_page`.


- **Decorator (optional):** If you need to add a decorator for pop-up closing, you'll need to provide the corresponding locator or other mechanisms inside `self.id_product`, `self.name`, etc. methods to allow the decorator to work. The decorator is currently commented out in the example.



This revised example is much more robust and ready for you to adapt and integrate the appropriate logic for extracting each product field from the `visualdg.co.il` website. Remember to replace the `# ...` placeholders with the actual code to fetch each specific data point.
