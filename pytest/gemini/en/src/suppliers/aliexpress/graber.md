```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Objects:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `Driver` and the functions inside the `Graber` class. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing external dependencies from affecting the results.

2. **Mock Driver:** A `MockDriver` is created for testing, and `Context.driver` is assigned to it within the `graber` fixture.  This is essential because the original `Graber` class relies on the `Context.driver` for interacting with the actual WebDriver.

3. **`asyncio.run`:**  The `asyncio.run` function is used within the test functions, correctly running the asynchronous `grab_page` method.

4. **Mocking `id_product`:** Mocking the `id_product` is done correctly.
    - Now the `future` is correctly assigned.
    - The `asyncio.run` calls are placed correctly within the test, making the test functions execute asynchronously, as they should.

5. **Proper Exception Handling:** The `test_grab_page_exception` test demonstrates how to handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of asynchronous methods. Importantly, it now correctly identifies the raised exception using `pytest.raises`.

6. **More Realistic Test Case (`test_grab_page_no_input`):** This test now mocking necessary functions inside `Graber` which are called during `grab_page`,  so the tests properly exercise the expected functionality without external dependencies.

7. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more explicit about the tested scenarios.

8. **Test Data Fixture:** The `test_product_fields` fixture provides a sample `ProductFields` object for testing.


**Important Considerations:**

- **WebDriver Interactions:** The code doesn't interact with a real WebDriver.  To fully test the interaction with a real driver, you need to make sure you have a setup where the driver can be instantiated, possibly using tools like Selenium, which your `Driver` class likely uses.  You will also need to modify the way the `Context` and `driver` are handled.


This revised solution provides more comprehensive and robust test cases that cover various scenarios and exception handling, making the test suite more reliable and useful. Remember to adapt this solution to the specific requirements of your application and integrate it with your actual WebDriver setup. Remember to install the `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` libraries if you haven't already.
