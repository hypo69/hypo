How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a constant `MODE` with the value 'dev' and sets the `__root__` variable to the absolute path of the 'hypotez' directory. It also appends this absolute path to the Python path (`sys.path`).  This is likely part of a larger project setup and is crucial for importing modules from different directories within the project.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `sys`, `os`, and `Path` modules from the `pathlib` library.  This is essential for interacting with the file system and Python's import system.
2. **Determine the project root directory:** It retrieves the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`) and extracts the path up to the `hypotez` directory. This part defines the `__root__` variable, which represents the path to the project's root directory.
3. **Append the root directory to the Python path:** The `sys.path.append(__root__)` line adds the project's root directory to the Python path. This allows Python to find modules located within the project's directories, even if they are not in standard Python library locations.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    # Example usage (assuming your project structure is similar)
    # This example demonstrates setting the __root__ variable and appending it to sys.path

    # Assuming hypotez is in the current directory.
    # Replace with the actual path to your project.
    __root__ : Path = os.getcwd()[:os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez') + 7]
    print(f"Calculated Root: {_root__}") # Verify the path

    sys.path.append(__root__)
    print(f"Path after append: {sys.path}")

    # Now you can import modules from within your project,
    # e.g., if you have a module in 'hypotez/src/mymodule.py'

    # from mymodule import my_function  # Replace with the actual import

    # my_function()
