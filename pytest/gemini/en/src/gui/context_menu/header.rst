**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `settings.json`:**  The solution now mocks the `settings.json` file using a function `mock_settings_json` to provide different content for tests. This allows us to control the file's content without creating or modifying actual files.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test evident.

3. **Fixture for cleanup:** A `remove_settings_file` fixture is added to delete the `settings.json` file after each test, preventing data interference between tests.

4. **Robust Path Handling:** The tests for calculating the root path now use `Path` objects consistently for better handling of different operating systems and potential path separators.  Also, the example project path is used more explicitly.

5. **Edge Case for path_not_added_if_exists:** Tests if paths already present in sys.path are skipped.


6. **Complete coverage:**  The tests now cover a wider range of scenarios, including default values, and handling where the path already exists.


7. **`pytest.raises`:** (not directly used in this particular code) The code in the prompt was simplified so that exceptions would be reported in a way that pytest can understand.


8. **Conciseness:** The code has been improved in terms of readability and efficiency where possible.


9. **Autouse Fixture:** The `remove_settings_file` is now an `autouse` fixture, ensuring that the cleanup happens automatically after every test, without needing to call it explicitly in each test method.


This revised solution provides a more comprehensive and robust test suite for the provided code. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Run the tests with `pytest`. Remember to replace `/myproject` with the actual path to your project if you are using a different structure for the project.


This complete solution should now run without issues and provide reliable test coverage for the Python code. Remember to adapt the paths to match your actual project structure.
