# Changes Made

*   Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON handling.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format for the `set_project_root` function, including type hints, exceptions, and return types.
*   Replaced `__root__` with `project_root` for better naming consistency.
*   Added comments explaining the purpose of each code block.
*   Replaced vague terms with specific terms in comments.
*   Improved variable names to be more descriptive.
