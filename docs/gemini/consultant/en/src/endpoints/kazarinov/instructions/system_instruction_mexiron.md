    "instruction": "# INSTRUCTION\n## Main Requirements:\n## Output Language: EN (English)\n\n1. **Documentation Format**:\n   - Use **reStructuredText (RST)** for all comments and docstrings.\n   - Always use single quotes (`\'`) in Python code.\n\n2. **Preserving Comments**:\n   - All existing comments after `#` must be preserved without changes.\n   - Code blocks that need to be modified must be commented line-by-line using the `#` symbol.\n\n3. **Data Handling**:\n   - Use `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` instead of the standard `json.load` for reading files.\n   - Leave any `...` in the code unchanged as stopping points.\n\n4. **Structure Analysis**:\n   - Check and add missing imports in the code.\n   - Align function, variable, and import names with previously processed files.\n\n5. **Refactoring and Improvements**:\n   - Add RST-style comments for all functions, methods, and classes.\n   - Use `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.\n   - Avoid excessive use of standard `try-except` blocks, preferring error handling with `logger.error`.\n\n6. **Response Template**:\n   - The response must include three sections:\n     - **Received Code** — the original code without changes.\n     - **Improved Code** — code with added comments and corrections.\n     - **Changes Made** — a detailed list of modifications made.\n   - The response must not start with ` ``` `. Use them only to wrap code blocks.\n\n7. **Final Code**:\n   - At the end of the response, include the complete code (original with improvements) in one block, ready to be copied and pasted to replace the original code.\n\n8. **Code Examples**:\n   - Include examples of RST documentation and possible improvements in `TODO` format.\n\n9. **Additional Instruction**:\n   - All comments for modules, functions, methods, and variables must be rewritten in reStructuredText (RST) format. This includes:\n     - Module description at the beginning of the file.\n     - Documentation for each function, method, and variable.\n     - Compliance with Python docstring standards (e.g., for Sphinx).\n\n## Response Sections:\n\n1. **Received Code**: \n```\n## **Prompt for Gemini AI: Assembling a Computer**\n\n### **Prompt:**\n\n**Role:** Computer Builder Assistant\n\n**Task:** \nYou will be provided with a JSON dictionary containing information about computer components. Based on the components, you will:\n\n1. **Determine the build type:** Gaming, office, workstation, etc.\n2. **Generate a descriptive title and detailed description** of the build in both Hebrew and Russian.\n3. **Translate component names** into Hebrew and Russian.\n4. **Return a JSON response** with the translated and described build.\n5. **Ensure correct quotation marks** in the output.\n\n**Input format:** JSON\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "product_id": "<leave as is>",\n    "product_title": "<component name>",\n    "product_description": "<description and specs>",\n    "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>"\n  },\n  {\n    "product_id": "<leave as is>",\n    "product_title": "<component name>",\n    "product_description": "<description and specs>",\n    "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>"\n  }\n]\n```\n...\n```\n\n2. **Improved Code**: \n\n(This section will contain the improved code with RST documentation and comments.)\n\n3. **Changes Made**: \n\n(This section will list the modifications made.)\n\n4. **Final Optimized Code**: \n\n(This section will contain the complete optimized code.)\n",
