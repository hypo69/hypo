# Module: hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/bberyakov

## Overview

This module provides classes for interacting with Google Spreadsheets.  It contains classes for working with entire spreadsheets (`GSpreadsheet`), individual worksheets (`GWorksheet`), and rendering functionalities (`GSRenderr`).


## Classes

### `GSpreadsheet`

**Description**: This class represents a Google Spreadsheet. It likely provides methods for interacting with the spreadsheet as a whole, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting spreadsheets.

**Methods (Placeholder):**
- `__init__`: Initialization method.
- `get_sheets`: Returns a list of `GWorksheet` objects representing the sheets in the spreadsheet.
- `create_sheet`: Creates a new worksheet.
- `delete_sheet`: Deletes a specified worksheet.
- ... (add other methods as needed)


### `GWorksheet`

**Description**: This class represents a single worksheet within a Google Spreadsheet. It likely provides methods for interacting with the worksheet's data, such as reading, writing, and modifying cells.

**Methods (Placeholder):**
- `__init__`: Initialization method.
- `get_cell_value`: Returns the value of a specific cell.
- `set_cell_value`: Sets the value of a specific cell.
- `append_row`: Appends a new row of data.
- ... (add other methods as needed)


### `GSRenderr`

**Description**: This class is likely responsible for rendering data from Google Sheets. It may provide methods for formatting and exporting data to various output formats (e.g., CSV, HTML).

**Methods (Placeholder):**
- `__init__`: Initialization method.
- `render_to_csv`: Renders worksheet data to a CSV string.
- `render_to_html`: Renders worksheet data to an HTML string.
- ... (add other methods as needed)



## Functions
