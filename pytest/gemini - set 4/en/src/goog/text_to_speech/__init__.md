**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`available_voices` fixture:** This fixture now correctly retrieves the voices from `pyttsx3`.  Crucially, it's used in the tests to avoid code duplication and to make testing more robust.

2. **`test_tts_init_prints_voices`:** This test specifically checks if the voices are printed. This is crucial to validate logging and output behavior.

3. **`test_voices_are_retrieved`:** Verifies that the voices are indeed retrieved and returned as a non-empty list. This prevents silent failures due to empty `voices` lists.


4. **`test_tts_init_engine`:** Checks if the `pyttsx3` engine is correctly initialized within the `__init__` method and thus ensuring the class structure is setup correctly.

5. **`test_tts_init_voice_details`:** Checks if the voice object attributes (`id`, `name`, `age`) exist.  This important test case helps verify the expected structure of the output.  Crucially, it avoids potentially hard-to-diagnose errors if `voices` lists are empty or do not contain the expected attributes.


6. **`test_tts_method_example`:** A placeholder test.  Update this with tests for any other methods that the `TTS` class might have.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Add more tests for edge cases and invalid input, such as passing incorrect types to methods. The provided example is very basic.
- **Output:** If the `TTS` class generates output to a file or a specific format, test that as well.
- **Dependency on `pyttsx3` and `gtts`:** Ensure that both libraries are properly installed in your testing environment (`pip install pyttsx3 gtts`).
- **`capsys` fixture:** The `capsys` fixture is used to capture stdout for the `test_tts_init_prints_voices` test case, which is necessary for testing that the voices are printed correctly.


This revised solution provides a more comprehensive and robust set of tests, addressing potential errors and providing more thorough validation of the `TTS` class's behavior. Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) in `test_tts_method_example` with actual assertions and logic appropriate to the new method. Remember to adjust these tests to accurately cover the specific functionality of any new methods or attributes in your `TTS` class.
