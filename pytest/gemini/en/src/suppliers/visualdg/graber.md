```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now includes `MockDriver` and `MockContext` classes to mock the `Driver` and `Context` objects. This is crucial for testing functions that depend on external dependencies (like WebDriver interaction) without actually interacting with a real browser.

2. **Fixtures:**  `mock_driver` and `mock_context` fixtures are defined to provide mock objects to the test functions. This ensures that each test case works with isolated, controlled test data, preventing side effects.

3. **`asyncio.run`:** The `asyncio.run` function is used to run the asynchronous `grab_page` method within the test functions.

4. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test descriptions are more precise and informative. 

5. **Edge Case for grab_page:** Added a test (`test_grab_page_invalid_input`) to check for an invalid driver input.

6. **Example for Other Functions:**  A basic `test_id_product_valid_input` example is included to show how to create tests for individual functions within the `Graber` class.  Remember to adapt this to mock the necessary aspects of your `id_product` function (e.g., its internal calls to the WebDriver).


**How to Run:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Place the `Graber` class and the test code in the same directory or import it correctly.
3. Run `pytest` in your terminal.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Complete Mocking:** Thoroughly mock *all* external dependencies and attributes of your class and functions.  The mocks should represent expected data and functionality but do not need to cover a full implementation.
- **Appropriate Assertions:** Replace the placeholder assertions (`assert ...`) with specific assertions that verify the expected behavior of the `Graber` class methods.  For example, check the values of the fields in `ProductFields`.
- **Data Generation:** Provide valid and invalid inputs, including boundary conditions and edge cases.
- **Exception Handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling, as demonstrated in the `test_grab_page_invalid_input` example.
- **Asynchronous Behavior:** Keep in mind the asynchronous nature of the code when designing tests.  Ensure you're using `asyncio.run` in the test functions to run the asynchronous methods.



Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ... your assertions ...`) with your actual assertions. This revised answer provides a significantly improved and comprehensive testing approach for the provided code. Remember that exhaustive testing requires extensive cases and specific assertions to address each function thoroughly.
