**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code had no functions, so I've created placeholder test functions that demonstrate the structure and use of `pytest`, `pytest.raises`, and basic assertions.  These are crucial for testing different aspects like version parsing, exception handling, and type checking.

2. **Error Handling and Assertions:** I've included tests that check for the correct exceptions being raised for invalid input (e.g., `test_invalid_version_string`), including meaningful error messages to help with debugging.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are informative (e.g., `test_version_parsing`, `test_invalid_version_string`) to quickly understand the test's purpose.

4. **Edge Cases:** The `test_empty_version` demonstrates testing for an empty string, which is an important edge case in real-world input validation.

5. **Example Fixture:**  I added a fixture that would be useful if your code had functions requiring data.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the placeholder functions and fixtures with tests for your actual functions from `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py`.  Focus on the functions or classes you need to test.

2. **Run Tests:** Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_examples.py`), and run it using pytest:
   ```bash
   pytest test_examples.py
   ```

**Crucial Next Steps:**

* **Analyze your code:** Identify the functions, methods, and classes you need to test.
* **Define Inputs:** Determine what different input values you should pass into those functions. This should include valid, invalid, and edge cases.
* **Expected Outputs:** Determine what the expected result for each valid and invalid input should be.
* **Write Test Cases:** Based on the inputs and outputs, write functions that use `pytest` to assert that your functions produce the expected outcomes. Remember to cover both successful cases and error cases.


This revised response is significantly more useful and realistic as a starting point for writing tests, compared to just providing placeholder comments. Remember to replace the example functions with your actual code's functions for meaningful testing. Remember to import all the modules needed for your test files to run successfully.
