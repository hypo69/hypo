**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to create mock objects for `Driver` and `Context`. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing dependencies on external resources (e.g., the browser).

2. **Fixtures:**  `mock_driver` and `graber` are defined as pytest fixtures, making the tests more organized and reusable.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init`, `test_graber_locator_for_decorator`).

4. **Test Cases:** A `test_graber_init` tests the initialization of the `Graber` class, verifying that the `supplier_prefix` and `driver` are properly set. A `test_no_decorator_execution` example demonstrates how to handle a method that doesn't use the decorator and how to test that functionality.

5. **Error Handling:** The `test_no_close_pop_up` example shows how to gracefully handle cases where a necessary function might not exist. This is essential for robustness.

6. **Placeholder Code:**  `execute_some_operation` and other placeholders were added to demonstrate testing a typical method call inside the `Graber` class. **Remember to replace these placeholders with the actual methods.**


**Important Considerations (and Next Steps):**

* **`close_pop_up` Method:**  The provided code snippet has a commented-out decorator.  You will need to adjust the `Graber` class if there is an actual `close_pop_up` method, or remove the test if it's not used.

* **Real `Driver` and `Context`:** Replace the mock objects with the actual `Driver` and `Context` objects from your project for production-level tests.

* **Error Handling:** Make sure your tests effectively handle potential exceptions raised by the `Graber` class (e.g., `ExecuteLocatorException`).

* **Complete Testing:** This example provides a structure.  Write tests for all the critical functions in the `Graber` class.  Include edge cases, invalid inputs, and different possible scenarios.
