This package provides a utility function for decoding numeric character references in micromark.

## Usage

This utility function decodes numeric character references, handling both hexadecimal and decimal representations. It returns the corresponding character.  Handles cases where the input might not be a valid character code.

```javascript
import { decodeNumericCharacterReference } from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference';

console.log(decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16)); // Output: A
console.log(decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10)); // Output: A
console.log(decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16)); // Output: � (Represents a control character)
console.log(decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16)); // Output: � (Represents an out-of-range character)
console.log(decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16)); // Output: \n (invalid reference, returns a newline)
```
