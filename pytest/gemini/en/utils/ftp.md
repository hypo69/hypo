**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `ftplib.FTP`:**  Critically important for testing. The `mock_ftp_session` fixture now correctly mocks the `ftplib.FTP` class.  This avoids actual FTP server interaction, making tests fast and reliable.  It now correctly sets up the mock calls (`storbinary`, `cwd`, `quit`).

2. **Error Handling:** The tests now more accurately check for the expected behavior when errors occur (e.g., file not found).

3. **Dummy File Fixture (`dummy_file`):** Creates a temporary file for the tests, ensuring that the file exists for the `write` function.

4. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions in the tests are now more specific, e.g., checking if `storbinary` was called.


5. **Edge Cases (Improved):** The `test_write_file_not_found` and `test_read_file_not_found` tests specifically address scenarios where the file doesn't exist.

6. **pytest.raises (Not Needed in this Form):**  The use of `pytest.raises` is unnecessary in these tests.  The error handling was already well covered by the `try...except` blocks in the functions themselves and is checked by asserting that the returned value is False.

7. **Import Statements:** Included the necessary `import` statements for the relevant modules.

8. **`tmp_path` fixture (crucial):** The solution now uses `tmp_path` from `pytest` to create temporary files for testing, which is much cleaner and prevents issues with keeping files across tests.

This revised solution is much more robust and accurate in testing the `ftp` functions without relying on an actual FTP server. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Run the tests with `pytest`. Remember to adapt `_connection` in your actual code for proper testing.
