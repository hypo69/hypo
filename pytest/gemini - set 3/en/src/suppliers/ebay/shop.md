**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The code now imports the `MODE` variable from the provided file.  Crucially, the path (`hypotez.src.suppliers.ebay.shop`) needs to be replaced with the actual path if it's different.

2. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code had no functions or classes, so placeholder tests are included to demonStarte the structure and how to use `pytest`.  **These tests are not functional until the actual `shop.py` code is provided.**  Replace the placeholder comments with your actual test cases.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names are descriptive and clearly indicate the test's purpose.

4. **Assertions:**  Assertions (`assert`) are used to verify the expected results.

5. **Exception Handling:**  The example (`test_function1_invalid_input`) shows how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions.

6. **Fixtures:** Placeholder fixture (`example_data`) is included, but you will need to modify it based on the actual function(s) it's used with.

**How to run these tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_shop.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_shop.py`

**Crucial Note:** These tests are *completely* dependent on the contents of `shop.py`.  **Provide the actual Python code from `shop.py` to get functional test cases.** Without the actual code, the tests remain placeholders.
