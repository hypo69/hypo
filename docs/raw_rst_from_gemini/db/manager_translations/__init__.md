# Добавьте здесь, если необходимо, другие импорты или функции
# для этого модуля.  Например:

# def get_translation(product_id, language_code):
#     # ... логика получения перевода ...
#     return translation


# Пример использования __version__
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print(f"Версия модуля: {__version__}")
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Docstrings:**  The docstrings are improved to be more comprehensive and Pythonic.  It's generally better to have a single, top-level docstring describing the module and what it does, rather than repeated docstrings for imports.

2. **Missing Functionality:** The original code was incomplete.  This revised code includes placeholder comments (`# Добавьте здесь...`) to show where you should add functions or other logic to handle translation management, such as retrieving translations by ID and language.  These placeholders are crucial for making the module functional.

3. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block (optional):** This block is now included as a *template* to demonstrate how to use the `__version__` variable, which is often useful for scripts or testing.  Remove or modify as needed for your specific use case.

4. **``:** This shebang line is preserved as it's likely needed for your specific environment. However, it might be better to use an appropriate `python` file for your virtual environment.

5. **Import order:**  Import `packaging.version` and then your internal modules.

**How to use it:**

1. **Implement the `get_translation` function (or similar):**  Fill in the `# ... логика получения перевода ...` placeholder. This should handle the retrieval of translations based on IDs and language codes from your database or other source.

2. **Create `ProductTranslationsManager` and `CategoryTranslationsManager` classes:**  Make sure these classes implement the necessary methods to interact with the database or your translation repository.


**Example of a complete `product_translations.py`:**

```python
from typing import Dict

class ProductTranslationsManager:

    def get_translation(self, product_id: int, language_code: str) -> Dict:
         # Replace this with your actual database access logic
        translations = {1: {"en": "Product 1", "ru": "Продукт 1"}} #Example translation
        return translations.get(product_id, {}).get(language_code)
```

This example provides a basic structure; you'll need to adapt it to fit your specific database and translation format.


By adding these implementations, you create a functional translation management module.  Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual logic.  Using type hints (`from typing import Dict`) is also a best practice to improve code readability and maintainability. Remember to structure your files in a logical manner within your `hypotez` project folder hierarchy.
