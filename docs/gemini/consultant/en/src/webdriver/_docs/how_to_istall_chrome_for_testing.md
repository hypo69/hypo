Changes Made

- Added a module-level docstring in reStructuredText format.
- Added a function-level docstring in reStructuredText format for `install_chrome_webdriver`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` and `try...except` blocks for robustness.
- Added placeholder comments (`# TODO`) for missing parts.  Crucially, these placeholders need to be replaced with the actual code and file paths.
- Corrected example usage to fit the structure of the function.
- Included a minimal `install_chrome_webdriver` function with a placeholder for the configuration file reading and the installation process.  The `...` are crucial, as these portions are missing from the original code.
- Implemented basic error handling (FileNotFoundError and general Exception).
- Added necessary imports (`from src.logger import logger`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`).
