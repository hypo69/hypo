# hypotez/src/fast_api/gemini.py

## Overview

This module defines a Flask application for interacting with a Google Generative AI model.  It exposes an endpoint `/ask` that accepts a JSON payload containing a prompt and returns the generated response.  Error handling is included for cases where no prompt is provided and for unexpected exceptions during the AI model interaction.

## Classes

### `GoogleGenerativeAI`

**Description**:  This class, presumably a wrapper or interface, is responsible for communicating with the Google Generative AI API.  Detailed functionality and implementation are not shown within this excerpt.

**Methods**

- `ask(prompt: str) -> str`:  This method takes a `prompt` as input and returns a generated `reply` from the generative AI model.  Detailed implementation details and potential exceptions are not specified within the provided code snippet.

## Functions


### `ask`

**Description**: This function acts as a Flask endpoint for handling requests to `/ask`. It receives a JSON payload containing a prompt, calls the `ai_model.ask()` method to get a response, and returns the response in a JSON format.

**Parameters**

- `data (dict, optional):` The JSON payload received from the request.

**Returns**

- `dict`: A JSON dictionary containing either the `reply` from the AI model or an `error` message.

**Raises**

- `Exception`:  A general exception.  Further details for different potential `Exception` types are not included in the code and should be added for more comprehensive documentation.


## Configuration


### `MODE`

**Description**: This variable presumably defines the execution mode for the application, e.g., development or production.  The variable's value is set to `'dev'`.

## Modules Used

This module uses the following external modules:

* `header`: This is an external module, but the code does not define how it is used. The missing import for `header` implies it should be included. More context is needed to understand this import.

* `Flask`: For creating the web application.

* `request`: For handling incoming HTTP requests.

* `jsonify`: For returning responses as JSON.

* `GoogleGenerativeAI`:  This module is presumably user-defined and contains the interface or wrapper for the Google Generative AI service.  More context is needed to understand this module's purpose and implementation.

## Error Handling

The code includes a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions during the interaction with the AI model. This is crucial for robustness, preventing crashes and providing user-friendly error messages.  Further specification of possible exceptions is needed.
