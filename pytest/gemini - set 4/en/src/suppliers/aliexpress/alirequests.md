**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function and the `Path` object, making the tests more robust and independent of external files.  This prevents real file access.
2. **Clearer Error Handling:**  The tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError` within the `_load_webdriver_cookies_file` function, improving error handling.
3. **Valid Cookies:** A `valid_cookie_file_path` fixture is introduced to create a temporary valid cookie file, which is used in tests needing valid cookies. This file is deleted after the test.
4. **`mock_open` Function:** The `mock_open` function is a crucial addition to mock the file opening behavior. This ensures that tests don't rely on actual files.
5. **Mock File Class:** A `mock_file` class is used to provide a proper mock for the file handling operations.
6. **Mocking `requests`:** Instead of relying on the real `requests` library, the `make_get_request` test now uses `patch` to simulate different outcomes (success or failure).
7. **Example Assertions:** The `test_make_get_request_success` test now includes an assertion to verify that the response status code is 200 (or whatever the expected status code is). This is important for verifying the success.
8. **Edge Case Test:** Added `test_load_webdriver_cookies_file_failure_pickle_error` to test when the data in the pickle file is invalid. This is now covered by the test cases.
9. **Import `pickle`:**  This crucial import is added to use the `pickle` module within the tests.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install `pytest` and other necessary packages if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest requests fake-useragent
    ```

2.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_aliexpress.py`) in the same directory as `alirequests.py` and run `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest test_aliexpress.py
    ```

This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and correctly utilizes mocking to ensure isolation and realistic test scenarios. Remember to replace `'https://www.example.com'` with an actual or mocked valid URL when running the test.


Important Considerations:

* **Error Handling:** The tests now properly address the error cases you're dealing with (file not found, invalid pickle data).
* **Mock `requests`:** Mocking the `requests` library is extremely important for isolating the `AliRequests` code from external network conditions and ensuring that your tests run quickly and reliably.
* **`Path` Mocking:** Mocking the `Path` object makes the tests more resilient and less prone to problems.
