How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/shop.py` module

This module, `shop.py`, appears to be part of a larger system for interacting with eBay shops.  Unfortunately, the provided code snippet is minimal and contains numerous multiline strings without any function or class definitions.  This makes it impossible to provide a complete usage guide.

To help you use this module, please provide:

1. **Function/Class Definitions:** The code needs to define functions or classes that perform specific actions.  Example:

```python
import requests

def get_shop_details(shop_id):
  """Fetches details about an eBay shop.

  Args:
    shop_id: The ID of the eBay shop.

  Returns:
    A dictionary containing shop details, or None if an error occurs.
  """
  # ... eBay API call using requests ...
  # ... error handling ...
  return shop_details
```

2. **eBay API Credentials:** Any eBay API interaction needs credentials (API key, secret, etc.) or a way to obtain those within the program.

3. **Data Structures:** Explain how the data returned by the API is structured and used (e.g., what attributes are available to the `shop_details` object from the example).


Once you provide a more complete code snippet showing how the module functions, I can create a detailed usage guide including:

* **Function Arguments and Return Values:** Explain what each parameter does and what the function returns.
* **Error Handling:** How to handle potential errors (e.g., invalid API keys, network issues, invalid shop IDs).
* **Example Usage:**  Include code examples demonstrating how to call the functions and interpret the results.
* **Dependencies:**  List any external libraries (e.g., `requests`) needed to use the module.

**Example of a helpful addition to `shop.py`:**

```python
import requests

# ... other imports ...

class EbayShop:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret):
        # ... initialization logic using api_key & api_secret ...


    def get_shop_details(self, shop_id):
        # ... API call using requests ...
        # ... error handling ...
        return shop_details  # dictionary

# ... rest of the module ...
```

With the complete code and a bit more context, a comprehensive and helpful usage guide can be generated.
