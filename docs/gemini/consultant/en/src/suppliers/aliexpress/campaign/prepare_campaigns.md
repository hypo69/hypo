## Changes Made

- Added missing import `import src.gs`.
- Added type hints to functions (`-> bool` or `-> None`) where appropriate.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) to all functions, variables, and classes according to the RST format specified.  
- Added `try...except` blocks around potentially problematic parts of `process_campaign` and `process_all_campaigns`, logging errors to the `logger`. This was crucial to prevent the script from crashing.
- Improved error handling: Replaced direct use of `print` with `logger.error` for better error management.
- Updated the `process_all_campaigns` function to include a `try...except` block to catch any potential exceptions during file processing and log them.
- Updated the `main_process` function to include a `try...except` block to catch any potential exceptions during category or campaign processing.
- Added `import src.gs` to explicitly import the necessary modules.
