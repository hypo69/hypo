How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block sets up the environment and imports necessary modules for a project, likely related to data processing, logging, and working with files.  It defines a root directory (`dir_root`), adds it to the system path, and imports various modules from custom packages (e.g., `gs`, `Supplier`, `Product`).  Crucially, it also configures a logging mechanism (`logger`) and includes utility functions for string manipulation, data handling, and file operations.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the root directory (`dir_root`) by extracting the path to the `hypotez` folder.
2. **Path Modification**: It modifies the Python module search path (`sys.path`) to include the root directory.  This allows the script to import modules from custom packages located within the project's structure.
3. **Import Statements**: Imports numerous modules, likely dealing with data management, logging, file handling, and potentially other functionalities specific to the project.
4. **Directory Information**: Prints the calculated root directory (`dir_root`).
5. **Utility Import**: Imports additional utility classes and functions for specific tasks, like formatting strings, validating data, and working with JSON data.
6. **Logging and Further Imports**: The crucial import of the `logger` module from a custom module suggests this codeblock is part of a system that utilizes logging for tracking events and debugging.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example demonStarting importing a module from a custom package
    from src.logger import logger

    # Example usage of a function from src.utils.string (assuming such a module exists)
    # string_to_format = "Example String"
    # formatted_string = StringFormatter.format_string(string_to_format)
    # print(formatted_string)


    #Example log message
    logger.info("Data processing started.")

    # ... (rest of the code using imported modules and custom functions) ...
