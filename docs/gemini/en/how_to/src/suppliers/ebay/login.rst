How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block, located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/login.py`, appears to be a module defining constants and possibly functions related to eBay login using a web driver.  It defines a single variable `MODE` with the value 'dev'.  The code is heavily commented with docstrings, indicating intent but not providing detailed functionality beyond the variable `MODE`.  The comments suggest the file is part of a larger project dealing with interacting with eBay through a web driver and likely involves login authentication.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a constant `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'. This constant likely controls the execution mode of the script. The code itself is minimal and provides no instructions on how to use the variable `MODE`.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a minimal example, as the code itself is very basic.
    # To use this module effectively, additional functions or classes would be necessary.

    import hypotez.src.suppliers.ebay.login as ebay_login

    print(ebay_login.MODE) # Output: dev
