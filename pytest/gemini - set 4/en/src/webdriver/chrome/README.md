```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`driver_path` fixture:** Introduced a `driver_path` fixture to hold the path to the ChromeDriver executable. This is crucial as it allows for easy modification of the path without directly hardcoding it in the test functions. Replace `/path/to/chromedriver` with the actual path.  The test also verifies that the file exists, preventing cryptic errors later on.

2. **`chrome_driver` fixture:**  The `chrome_driver` fixture now properly handles the creation and closing of the Chrome driver instance. This is essential for resource management and prevents resource leaks.

3. **`test_chrome_driver_launch`:** Checks if a WebDriver instance is successfully created, adding robustness.

4. **`test_cdp_cmd_invalid_command`:**  Now uses `pytest.raises` to test the exception handling.  This is critical; your code should gracefully handle cases where an invalid command is sent to the DevTools Protocol.

5. **More comprehensive tests:** Added tests covering the `Page.enable` and `Page.navigate` commands.  Crucially, the `Page.navigate` test only *checks* for a response - it does *not* try to verify the page has loaded. (A real test would use `WebDriverWait` to wait for a page to load and check an element.)

6. **`test_chromedriver_exists`:** This function verifies that the ChromeDriver is actually on your system, avoiding runtime failures if the driver file is missing.


**Before running:**

- **Install necessary libraries:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest selenium
  ```

- **Download ChromeDriver:** Download the appropriate ChromeDriver version for your Chrome browser from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

- **Place ChromeDriver:** Put the downloaded ChromeDriver executable in a location where Python can find it (e.g., in the same directory as your test file or in a directory listed in your system's PATH).  The `driver_path` fixture now makes it easy to modify the location if needed.


- **Run the tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest test_webdriver_cdp.py  # Replace test_webdriver_cdp.py with the name of your test file.
  ```


This improved set of tests provides better coverage, handles potential errors, and follows best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to adapt the test cases according to the specific functionalities you want to test in your Python code.  Crucially, add waiting mechanisms, element checks, and more elaborate scenarios for complete testing of the `execute_cdp_cmd` function.
