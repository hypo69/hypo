```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Test Data:** Introduced `dummy_project_root` and `project_root_not_found_dir` fixtures to create temporary directories for testing, avoiding the need to modify the actual project directory.  This is crucial for test isolation.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and informative, clearly indicating the scenario being tested.
* **Comprehensive Scenarios:** The tests now include scenarios with a single marker file, multiple marker files, and no marker files found, addressing a wider range of input conditions.
* **Edge Case Handling:** The test `test_set_project_root_root_does_not_exist` is added to handle the case where the directory does not have the marker file, and the function should return the current directory.
* **Exception Handling (Crucial):** The tests now include `pytest.raises` to verify that the code correctly handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  This is a significant improvement for robustness.
* **Isolated Tests:** The tests are now independent. Changes in one test do not affect other tests.
* **Correct `assert` Statements:** The assertions are checked against the expected results.
* **Robust Test Data:** The fixtures now set up the necessary conditions for each test, such as the presence or absence of the marker files.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Settings File:**  You'll need to add tests to verify the correct reading of `settings.json` and handling of potential `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, etc. Create a test that provides dummy data in `settings.json` (if needed).
*   **README.MD:** Similar tests for reading `README.MD` and handling exceptions.


This improved solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adapt the fixture data and assertions to your specific needs.  The most important thing is to **test the important paths in the function**. Always use fixtures for this purpose in pytest.
