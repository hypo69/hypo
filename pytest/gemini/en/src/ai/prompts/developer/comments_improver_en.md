**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Example Code:**  The provided code was empty. I've added example functions (`add_numbers` and `divide_numbers`) to demonstrate the testing process.  **Crucially, replace this with your actual code.**

2. **Fixtures:** A `valid_numbers` fixture provides reusable test data.  This is a best practice for avoiding repetition.  Use fixtures for any data needed by multiple test cases.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
   - `test_add_numbers_*` covers various input types (positive, negative, floats).
   - `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type` correctly uses `pytest.raises` to check for `TypeError` when invalid input is given.
   - `test_divide_numbers_*` tests division with valid and edge cases (zero divisor).


4. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions clearly show the expected results.


5. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):** The code now demonstrates how to test for exceptions, including a specific `ZeroDivisionError` case.


6. **Docstrings:**  Clear docstrings improve readability and understanding.


**How to Use with Your Code:**

1. **Replace the Example Code:**  Delete the example functions and replace them with your actual Python code.

2. **Adapt the Tests:**  Modify the test cases to accurately reflect the structure of your code and the types of data it expects.   The important part is to think about:
   - **Input Types:** What kinds of data do your functions accept?
   - **Valid Outputs:** What are the expected outcomes for various inputs?
   - **Edge Cases:** What problematic inputs might cause errors or unexpected results? (e.g., very large or very small numbers, empty lists, etc.)
   - **Exceptions:** Does your code raise exceptions under specific conditions? Test these thoroughly.

3. **Run the Tests:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_my_code.py`) and run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_my_code.py`

This revised response provides a much more robust and helpful starting point for writing tests. Remember to tailor the test cases to the specific requirements of your code. Remember to fill in the missing code!
