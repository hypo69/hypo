**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Docstrings:**  Improved docstrings with more details, including examples, and a more informative module description.  Added a `Raises` section for the `show_spinner` function to document potential `TypeError` exceptions.  Docstrings now follow the standard Python style.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section to gracefully handle `TypeError` exceptions that might occur if the user provides invalid input types to `show_spinner()`.  This makes the example code more robust.
* **Type Hinting:**  Added type hints (`duration: float = 5.0`, `delay: float = 0.1`) to make the function's parameters clearer about their expected type.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Replaced `cursor` (in the inner loop) with `spinner` to better reflect that it's the source of the spinner characters. This is done to align with the function's overall purpose.
* **Consistency:** Consistent formatting and style throughout the code.


This improved version is more complete, easier to understand, and follows best practices for Python code.  The examples and error handling make it more user-friendly. Remember to save the code as `cursor_spinner.py` in the specified directory.
