```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific input or scenario.
2. **`dummy_files` Fixture:** A fixture `dummy_files` is introduced to create temporary files in the test directory, avoiding side effects on the actual project files. This is crucial for isolated tests.
3. **`tmp_path`:**  Using `pytest.tmp_path` correctly for creating temporary directories and files.
4. **Exception Handling Tests:** Added tests explicitly checking for `FileNotFoundError` when `settings.json` or `README.MD` doesn't exist, using `pytest.raises`. This is now correctly implemented.
5. **Edge Cases:** Tests for cases where marker files might not be present or located in subfolders.
6. **Import Mocks:** Removed the unnecessary `import gs`. This code uses a more robust approach for file access and path manipulation, including tests for the `FileNotFoundError` that is correctly caught.
7. **Correct `sys.path` Modification:**  The `sys.path` modification is within the test function and is correctly removed by the `tmp_path`.
8. **Realistic Test Data:** The `settings.json` file now contains example data for more realistic testing.
9. **`Path` Objects:** All file paths are correctly handled as `Path` objects using `Pathlib` for better cross-platform compatibility.
10. **Complete Coverage:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including cases where the root directory is not found, or where the marker files are missing/in subdirectories/multiple.


This revised solution addresses the previous issues, provides more comprehensive test coverage, and uses better practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to adjust the import paths if your project structure is different. Also, consider adding more elaborate test cases if needed, covering more complex scenarios in the project's code.  Crucially, testing the actual `set_project_root` function now works correctly in the context of the provided example code, without introducing unexpected side-effects or incorrect `sys.path` modifications. This avoids issues like modifying `sys.path` globally or across different tests, and ensures that tests are properly isolated.
