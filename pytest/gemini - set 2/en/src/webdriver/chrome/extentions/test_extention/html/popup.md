```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  Therefore,
# no tests can be written.  This is a placeholder.

# Example of a test function if there was Python code.
# def test_some_function_with_html_input():
#     # This would be a placeholder, in a real scenario,
#     # you would mock interactions with the html/popup.html
#     # file, and this is where you would place your assertions.
#     # For example, if popup.html had a button to press:
#     assert True  # Replace with your actual assertion
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is a static HTML document.  It does *not* contain any Python code to test.  Therefore, there's nothing to test directly in the `popup.html` file.

If the HTML file interacted with Python code (e.g., via JavaScript that makes API calls or handles form submissions), then you would need a corresponding Python file (likely in a `popup.py` file) that handles those interactions.  You'd then write `pytest` tests to verify that the Python code in `popup.py` is functioning correctly.

**How to Write Tests for Interactions with HTML:**

1. **Mock the HTML Interactions:**  To test the Python code's behavior in response to interactions with the HTML, you'd typically mock (simulate) the parts of the JavaScript code or API calls.  `pytest-mock` is a useful tool for this purpose.


2. **`pytest-html` (for Reporting):** To make the HTML itself a part of the testing process (like checking for correct content display), you would use a framework like `pytest-html` to capture and present test results with the HTML snippets included in the test report.


3. **Example (`popup.py`):**  If `popup.py` existed and contained code to interact with the HTML (e.g., a button click triggering an API request), the test would look like this (example):

```python
import pytest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# ... (other imports, if any) ...

@pytest.fixture
def driver():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    return driver

def test_button_click_redirects(driver):
    # Load the HTML (or a mock HTML representation).  This is the crucial part.
    driver.get("file://path/to/popup.html") # OR a mock

    button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.TAG_NAME, "button"))
    )  # Assumes the button's tag name is button
    button.click()

    # Assert conditions, e.g.,
    assert "expected_url" in driver.current_url
    # Or check elements appearing, text content changes etc.


```

**In summary:**  The provided `popup.html` file itself isn't testable in isolation.  You need to combine it with Python code (likely in a `popup.py` file), mock the HTML interactions, and write tests for the Python functions that manage that interaction.  The provided code is missing the essential Python logic to create any useful test cases.
