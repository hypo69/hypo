#Example usage (not part of the formal tests but illustrates how you might use the data.)
#Example with valid credentials and API endpoint:
# url, auth_header = get_api_url("e-cat.co.il", "products")
# if url and auth_header:
#   print("API URL:", url)
#   print("Authorization:", auth_header)


#Example with invalid credentials or endpoint:
# url, auth_header = get_api_url("nonexistentsite", "orders")
# if url and auth_header:
#    print("API URL:", url)
#    print("Authorization:", auth_header)
#else:
#    print("No credentials or endpoint found.")

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `get_credentials`:** The original code lacked a way to read from `credentials.kdbx`.  The `get_credentials` function now acts as a mock, returning sample credentials. Replace this with your actual credential retrieval logic if needed.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test suite now covers valid inputs, invalid input (unknown site), and a scenario where a key might be missing.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_api_url_valid_input`).

4. **`pytest.raises` (Not Applicable):**  The provided code doesn't involve exception handling, so `pytest.raises` is not necessary in these initial tests. If exception handling were part of `get_credentials`, you'd use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.

5. **Fixture (Not Needed):**  Given the simple nature of the `get_credentials` function, a fixture isn't required.

6. **Correct Base64 Handling:** The example credentials are correctly encoded and decoded.

7. **Example Usage (Illustrative):**  The example usage blocks demonstrate how you can use the functions created.  Crucially, they show how to handle cases where `get_api_url` might return `None` (indicating missing credentials or endpoint).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_prestashop.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_prestashop.py` from your terminal.

Remember to replace the mocked `get_credentials` function with your actual implementation for production-ready tests.  If your `credentials.kdbx` handling involves exception handling (e.g., file not found), then modify the tests accordingly. Also, adjust the test cases according to your actual credential validation/ retrieval mechanisms.
