```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now properly handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Crucially, it also **prints the error message** to the console. This is essential for debugging.  Without knowing why the settings file is missing or corrupt, you can't fix the problem.

2. **Pathlib:**  The code now uses `pathlib.Path`.  This is significantly better for cross-platform compatibility.  It avoids potential issues with different operating system's file separators (`\` vs `/`).

3. **Clearer Error Message:** The error message now explicitly states what went wrong.

4. **Initialization:** The variables `__doc__` and `__details__` are explicitly initialized to empty strings. This is good practice, as it avoids potential issues with undefined variables later in the code.


**How to Use the Improved Code:**

1.  **settings.json:** Create a `settings.json` file in the `hypotez/src` directory with the following structure (or similar):

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2023",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

2.  **Import and Use:** In other parts of your project, you can access these variables like this:


```python
import sys
from hypotez.src.endpoints.bots.version import __version__

print(f"The version of the project is: {__version__}")
```

This revised code is more robust, maintainable, and provides crucial debugging information. Remember to replace `"My Awesome Project"` and the other example values with your actual data. Also consider using logging for better error handling and information in production environment.
