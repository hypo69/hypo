## Installation

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (version 16+)**

```bash
npm install micromark-util-html-tag-name
```

**Deno (with `esm.sh`)**

```typescript
import { htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames } from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1';
```

**Browsers (with `esm.sh`)**

  import { htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames } from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle';
  console.log(htmlBlockNames); // Access the arrays here
</script>
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames } from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name';

console.log(htmlBlockNames); // Output: Array of block tag names
console.log(htmlRawNames);   // Output: Array of raw tag names
```

## API Reference

### `htmlBlockNames`

An array of lowercase HTML "block" tag names (`Array<string>`).

These tags, when encountered during HTML parsing, are handled with more relaxed rules to allow for more variability in the structure of the HTML content.

See the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks) for details on how these tags are processed.

### `htmlRawNames`

An array of lowercase HTML "raw" tag names (`Array<string>`).

When parsing, these tags signify that the content within them should not be parsed further, ensuring the preservation of potentially complex formatting in the content.

See the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks) for details on how these tags are processed.


## Types

This package is fully typed with TypeScript.
