```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.amazon import Graber, get_list_products_in_category

# No data needed for testing these initial modules as they are
# just importing modules and setting up a MODE variable.
# This is a very basic example.  Real tests would require
# mock data and/or specific implementation in the 'graber' and
# 'scenario' modules


def test_get_list_products_in_category_not_implemented():
    """Checks that get_list_products_in_category is not yet implemented."""

    # Simulate a situation where the underlying implementation isn't yet complete
    with pytest.raises(NotImplementedError):
        get_list_products_in_category("some_category")



def test_graber_class_exists():
    """Checks that the Graber class exists."""
    assert Graber


# Example test if you had a method in Graber:

# def test_graber_method_exists():
#     """Checks that a method exists in the Graber class."""

#     graber_instance = Graber() # Assuming initialization is necessary
#     assert hasattr(graber_instance, "fetch_products")

```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Limited Testable Functionality:** The provided code snippet from `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/__init__.py` only imports modules and defines a constant.  There's no actual function or class *implementation* to test at this level.  The `test_get_list_products_in_category_not_implemented` test is a placeholder.


2. **Missing Implementation:**  To write effective tests, you need the actual implementation of `Graber` and `get_list_products_in_category` in `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/graber.py` and `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/scenario.py`.


3. **Mock Data:** Real-world tests would almost certainly need mock data or a way to simulate the external services (like fetching data from Amazon). `pytest-mock` is a helpful library for mocking.


4. **Error Handling:** If `get_list_products_in_category` was expected to raise exceptions under specific conditions (e.g., invalid category name), you'd need appropriate `pytest.raises` tests to verify the exception handling logic.


5. **Testing Deeper:** The given example only shows very basic tests.  The full test suite would need to check different input types, potentially validate output types, cover edge cases with the Amazon API (if calling external services), and potentially test more specific functionality of the `Graber` class.


**Example of how to structure tests for `scenario.py` (assuming it has functionality):**


```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.amazon.scenario import get_list_products_in_category
import requests # Example external service


@pytest.fixture
def mock_amazon_response():
    """Returns a mock Amazon API response."""
    # This would use a mocking library like pytest-mock in real-world scenarios
    mock_response = {
        "products": [{"id": 1, "name": "Product 1"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Product 2"}]
    }
    return mock_response




def test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input(mock_amazon_response, monkeypatch):
    """
    Checks correct behavior with valid input.  Assuming the implementation makes a request.
    """
    # Replace `requests.get` with a mocked response using monkeypatch
    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, 'get', lambda *args, **kwargs: mock_amazon_response)

    products = get_list_products_in_category("electronics")
    assert products == mock_amazon_response['products']
    assert type(products) == list



def test_get_list_products_in_category_invalid_category(mock_amazon_response, monkeypatch):
    """Handles an invalid category."""

    # Simulate an empty response (or a different error) from the external service
    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, 'get', lambda *args, **kwargs: {})


    with pytest.raises(Exception) as excinfo:
        get_list_products_in_category("invalid_category")


    assert "No data received" in str(excinfo.value) # Or some expected error message




```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments and example data with the actual implementations and expected behaviors from your code.  Crucially, you need the underlying implementation in `scenario.py` and possibly `graber.py` to write meaningful and accurate tests. Also, use a mocking library like `pytest-mock` for simulating external API calls.
