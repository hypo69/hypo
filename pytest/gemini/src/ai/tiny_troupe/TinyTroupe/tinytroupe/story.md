```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `openai_utils.client`:** The crucial `openai_utils.client` is mocked using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`. This eliminates the dependency on a real OpenAI API call, allowing tests to run without requiring an API key or making external requests.


2. **Fixtures for `TinyWorld` and `TinyPerson`:**  Fixtures (`example_environment`, `example_agent`) are created to provide mock objects for the `TinyWorld` and `TinyPerson` types. This isolates the `TinyStory` tests from the complexities of the actual classes, focusing only on the methods being tested. These fixtures also set up a mock for `pretty_current_interactions` which returns meaningful values for testing purposes.


3. **Comprehensive `__init__` Tests:** The tests cover all the `__init__` possibilities, including valid inputs (environment only, agent only), invalid inputs (both environment and agent), and an edge case where neither is provided.


4. **Clear Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.


5. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The tests now effectively use `pytest.raises` to verify that the expected exceptions are raised when appropriate.


6. **Test `start_story` and `continue_story`:**  The added tests for `start_story` and `continue_story` now mock the `openai_utils.client`. This makes them much more robust, as they won't depend on a live OpenAI connection during testing.


This improved solution addresses the issues with the earlier example and produces more reliable and comprehensive tests that cover different scenarios without relying on external services. Remember to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest
