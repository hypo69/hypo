**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`driver_instance` Fixture:** This fixture now correctly creates a `webdriver.Firefox()` instance, runs the test, and quits the driver.  Critically, it's marked for use with `@pytest.mark.usefixtures`, ensuring the browser is properly initialized and closed for each test. This prevents issues of stale driver instances.

2. **`test_borderify_invalid_border`:** This test now handles the case where the provided `border` style is invalid.  It checks if the `border_style` is `None`.  This test addresses the potential for crashes. Crucially, it asserts that the *style is not none*, showing that the script doesn't throw an exception even with invalid input, as it should.

3. **`test_borderify_complex_script`:** This shows how to test multiple actions within a single script.


4. **Explicit Alert Handling:** The `test_borderify_alert` test now correctly handles the alert.  It's crucial to use `alert.accept()` or `alert.dismiss()` to acknowledge the alert, otherwise, the test will hang.

5. **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` block to `test_borderify_alert` to catch potential `TimeoutException` if the alert doesn't appear within the expected time.


6. **Robustness:** Tests are now more robust by using `about:blank` instead of a dynamically-generated page. This ensures that the tests are focused on the script itself and not on any potentially different page structure.

7. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more explicit, stating what is expected in the `assert` statements, improving the readability and meaning of the tests.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager geckodriver
    ```
2.  You'll need a geckodriver executable.  Download it from [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and put it in a directory on your PATH.

3.  Save the Python code above in a file (e.g., `test_borderify.py`).

4.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_borderify.py
    ```


This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests, addressing potential errors and improving code clarity. Remember to install the necessary packages if you haven't already. Remember to install geckodriver and include the path. Remember to install `selenium` and `webdriver-manager` as well.
