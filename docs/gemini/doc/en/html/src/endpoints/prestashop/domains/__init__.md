<h1>Module: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module initializes the PrestaShop domains endpoint.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<h3><code>MODE</code></h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: A string constant defining the current mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong>: 'dev'</p>


<p><strong>Note</strong>:  The module includes several """docstrings""" with similar structure.  While these seem like comments (which aren't well structured and don't contain the required detail), this is the level of detail available from the given input file.  In a real-world scenario,  proper function/class documentation within the Python code would be essential.</p>
