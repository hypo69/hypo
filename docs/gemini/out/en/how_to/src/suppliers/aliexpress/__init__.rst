How to use the aliexpress module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module initializes and provides access to various classes related to the AliExpress API.  It defines constants and imports necessary classes for interacting with AliExpress, including API communication, campaign management, and potentially HTML generation.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. Imports required classes: The module imports classes from submodules like `aliexpress`, `aliapi`, `alirequests`, `campaign`, and associated HTML generation classes.

2. Sets a mode: The code defines a constant `MODE` which, in this case, is set to 'dev'. This likely indicates a development mode for the application.

3. Provides access points: The module exports classes like `Aliexpress`, `AliApi`, `AliRequests`, `AliCampaignEditor`, and various `HTMLGenerator` classes. This allows other parts of the application to use these classes to interact with AliExpress.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress import Aliexpress, AliApi, AliCampaignEditor

    # Create an instance of the AliExpress class
    aliexpress_instance = Aliexpress()

    # Access the AliApi object, assumed to be available through the Aliexpress instance.
    aliapi_instance = aliexpress_instance.api

    # Create an instance of the AliCampaignEditor
    campaign_editor = AliCampaignEditor(aliapi_instance)  # Assuming AliApi is required for this.

    # Example usage, assuming methods exist on campaign_editor:
    campaign_id = 12345
    try:
        campaign_data = campaign_editor.get_campaign_details(campaign_id)
        print(f"Campaign details for campaign ID {campaign_id}: {campaign_data}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving campaign details: {e}")
