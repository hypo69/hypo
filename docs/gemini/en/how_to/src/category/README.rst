How to use the Product Categorization Module
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module provides a method for categorizing product data received from a supplier.  It defines a `Product` class to encapsulate product information and a method to categorize that product based on provided criteria.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Instantiate a `Supplier` object:**  Create an instance of the `Supplier` class, providing any necessary parameters to initialize the supplier connection or data source.

2. **Retrieve product data:** Use the `get_product_data()` method of the `Supplier` class to fetch product data from the supplier. This will likely return a list or a dictionary of product data.

3. **Create `Product` objects:** Iterate through the retrieved product data. For each item, instantiate a `Product` object, populating its attributes (e.g., product name, price, etc.) with the corresponding values from the data.

4. **Categorize products:** Use the `categorize_product()` method of the `Product` class to assign a category to each `Product` object.  This method should implement the logic for determining the product category based on the product attributes.

5. **Process categorized products:** Depending on your needs, you can further process the now-categorized `Product` objects (e.g., store them in a database, display them in a user interface).

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming Supplier and Product classes are defined elsewhere
    from supplier import Supplier
    from product import Product

    # Instantiate a Supplier object (replace with your supplier initialization)
    supplier = Supplier("your_supplier_credentials")

    # Retrieve product data
    product_data = supplier.get_product_data()

    # Iterate through product data and create Product objects
    products = []
    for product_item in product_data:
        product = Product(product_item['name'], product_item['price'], product_item['description'])
        products.append(product)

    # Categorize products
    for product in products:
        product.categorize_product()

    # Print categorized products (example)
    for product in products:
        print(f"Product: {product.name}, Category: {product.category}")
