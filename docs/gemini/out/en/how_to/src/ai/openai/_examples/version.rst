How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines several variables, likely for a module or package, including the version number (`__version__`), and a mode (`MODE`).  It also defines placeholders for documentation strings (`__doc__`, `__details__`), type annotations (`__annotations__`), and author information (`__author__`).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code sets a variable `MODE` to the string value 'dev'.
2. It defines several variables:
    - `__version__`: Stores the version string "3.12.0.0.0.4".
    - `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__annotations__`, `__author__`:  These are placeholders for documentation strings, module details, type annotations, and author information respectively.  They are currently empty strings or unassigned.
3. The code likely belongs to a larger module or package within a project.  It's designed to be imported into other modules, potentially for versioning and other metadata information.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is an example of how you would access the version if this code is in a module.  This would not be run in the file itself.
    import version  # Assuming the file is named 'version.py'

    print(version.__version__)
    print(version.MODE)
