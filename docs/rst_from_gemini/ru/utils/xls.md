Module: src.utils.xls

Converter for Excel (`xls`) to JSON and JSON to Excel (`xls`).
This module provides functions to convert Excel files to JSON format, handle multiple sheets, and save JSON data back to Excel files.

Functions:
    read_xls_as_dict(xls_file: str, json_file: str = None, sheet_name: Union[str, int] = None) -> Union[Dict, List[Dict], bool]:
        Reads an Excel file and converts it to JSON.  Optionally, converts a specific sheet and saves the result to a JSON file.  Handles errors gracefully.

    save_xls_file(data: Dict[str, List[Dict]], file_path: str) -> bool:
        Saves JSON data to an Excel file.  The data should be a dictionary where keys are sheet names and values are lists of dictionaries representing rows. Handles errors gracefully.

Examples:
    # Reading and optionally saving to JSON
    data = read_xls_as_dict('input.xlsx', 'output.json', 'Sheet1')  # Reads sheet named 'Sheet1'
    if data:
        print(data)  # Output will be {'Sheet1': [{...}]}

    # Saving from JSON data
    data_to_save = {'Sheet1': [{'column1': 'value1', 'column2': 'value2'}]}
    success = save_xls_file(data_to_save, 'output.xlsx')
    if success:
        print("Successfully saved to output.xlsx")

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added comprehensive `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions during both reading and writing operations.  Crucially, this now logs the specific error messages, making debugging much easier.  Returning `False` from functions indicates failure.
* **Logging:** Introduced `logging` for better error messages and tracking. This makes it much easier to diagnose problems if something goes wrong.  Logging is configured to write messages to the console.
* **Clearer Docstrings:** Improved docstrings with examples demonstrating how to use the functions effectively, and improved explanations.
* **File Existence Check:** Added a check to ensure the input Excel file exists before attempting to read it.
* **Sheet-Specific Error Handling:**  Handles potential errors during processing of individual sheets, preventing the entire operation from failing if one sheet has issues.


**How to use:**

```python
# Example usage (remember to replace 'input.xlsx' with your file)
data = read_xls_as_dict('input.xlsx', 'output.json', 'Sheet1')  # Read specific sheet

if data:
    success = save_xls_file(data, 'output.xlsx')
    if success:
        print("Successfully saved to output.xlsx")
    else:
        print("Failed to save to output.xlsx")
else:
    print("Failed to read the data.")
```


This revised code is more robust and provides much better feedback in case of errors, which is crucial for production-level code. Remember to install the `pandas` and `xlsxwriter` libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter
```

Remember to install `logging` if you haven't already (it's usually included with Python).  The logging output is very helpful for debugging.
