```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now use more specific assertions (`assert result == {"result": True}`) to verify the expected outcome of the `driver_payload` and other methods.

2. **Exception Handling (pytest.raises):**  `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test for expected exceptions in cases like `test_driver_payload_invalid_input` and `test_locale_invalid_input`.  The error message is checked to ensure the correct exception is raised with the appropriate message.

3. **Mock Executor:** A `MockExecutor` class is included to simulate the `executor` object, which is crucial for testing without needing a real web driver.  Replace this with your actual implementation if you have one.

4. **Fixture for `DriverBase`:** The `driver_base` fixture now creates a `DriverBase` instance using the mock executor, allowing tests to use a fresh driver instance for each test.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The example includes tests for both valid and invalid input scenarios for `driver_payload`, `scroll`, and `locale`. You need to add similar tests for other methods of your `DriverBase` class.

6. **Input Validation:** Added tests to validate the type of input to `scroll`, showing how to handle TypeError.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `from webdriver.driver import DriverBase` with the actual import path to your `DriverBase` class.
2. **Implement `MockExecutor` (or replace):**  If `DriverBase` needs a `webdriver` object, implement a mock class to simulate the WebDriver interaction. Otherwise, you may remove the `MockExecutor` and the associated fixtures.
3. **Add Tests for Other Methods:** Add more test functions following the example structure for all the important methods of your `DriverBase` class, including tests for edge cases and exception handling.
4. **Run Tests:** Run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.


This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of test cases for the `DriverBase` class, making it suitable for real-world applications. Remember to adapt the assertions and test cases to match the specific behavior and expected outputs of your `DriverBase` class.
