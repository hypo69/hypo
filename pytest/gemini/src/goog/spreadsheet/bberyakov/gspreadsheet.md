**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `gspread` functions. This is crucial for testing the `GSpreadsheet` class without actually interacting with Google Sheets. This prevents errors and allows you to control the return values.

2. **Specific Exceptions:** The `test_get_by_id_invalid_id` test now correctly asserts that an expected exception (e.g., `gspread.exceptions.APIError`) is raised with an invalid spreadsheet ID, and includes a meaningful assertion to ensure the exception is expected.

3. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover scenarios like valid and nonexistent spreadsheets for `get_by_title`, proper initialization with an ID, proper initialization with a title, valid and invalid spreadsheet IDs, and existence checks.

4. **Clarity and Readability:** Test function names are more descriptive. Comments explain the logic of the tests for better maintainability.


**How to Use:**

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest gspread google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Replace placeholders:**  Fill in the appropriate placeholders (e.g., the actual `global_settingspread` module path) in your `import` statements and any other needed components.


3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```


This improved test suite is more robust and realistic, ensuring your code works as expected with different inputs and edge cases. Remember to adapt the tests to the exact behavior and error handling of your `global_settingspread` module. Also, consider mocking the `json.loads` function more effectively to prevent unexpected file access.
