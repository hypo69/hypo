**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `unittest.mock.patch` and `MagicMock` to mock external dependencies like the `Driver` and `Context` classes.  This is *absolutely essential* for unit testing asynchronous code.  You can't directly run the `async` functions in a `pytest` test; you need to mock the behavior of the underlying parts of the code.

2. **Mock Data:**  Critically, `mock_driver.fields` is now correctly assigned a `ProductFields` object (or whatever is returned by `ProductFields`).  This simulates the function's return, allowing you to verify the results. **You absolutely must assign some data to `mock_driver.fields`**.

3. **Asynchronous Handling:** The `test_grab_page_valid_input` now uses `asyncio.run()` to run the asynchronous code within the test.

4. **Specific Function Tests:** The example `test_id_product_valid_input` shows how to test a *specific* function of `Graber`.  This is better than just testing the entire `grab_page` function; you are testing the logic inside the function, rather than just checking the function's exit.

5. **Error Handling:** The example `test_grab_page_missing_id_product` demonStartes exception handling, and a better structure of testing.

6. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now have more specific assertions about the expected data types and return values, ensuring your tests are checking *meaningful* parts of the code.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Install `pytest`:**  `pip install pytest`
- **Replace Placeholder Imports:** Replace placeholders like `from src import gs` with actual imports from your project if they exist.
- **Replace Mock Data:**  Implement appropriate mocking for all the fields and functions within the `Graber` class that the test needs access to.

This revised solution significantly improves testability by addressing the core issues of testing asynchronous code and making your tests more focused on the specific logic of your functions, instead of just the whole flow of an async function. Remember to add tests for other functions and error conditions as needed.
