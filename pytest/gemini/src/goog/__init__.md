**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`TestSpreadsheet` Class:** This structure organizes tests for the `SpreadSheet` class more effectively.

2. **`pytest.fixture`:** The `spreadsheet_instance` fixture creates a `SpreadSheet` object once for each test method, making tests more isolated and faster.  This was missing in the initial response.

3. **Example Tests:**  Crucially, the examples now use `pytest.raises` for exception testing, and the examples illustrate how to test different kinds of inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases).  They also check for expected *types* of exceptions.

4. **Clear Assertions:** Replace placeholders (`assert result == ...`) with actual checks based on your `SpreadSheet` class's logic and expected behavior.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Consider adding tests for various scenarios, like:
   - Empty inputs
   - Large datasets
   - Different data types
   - Specific error conditions related to the spreadsheet operations (e.g., file not found, invalid format).

6. **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks are essential for testing exception handling within your methods.


**To run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_goog.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_goog.py
   ```

Remember to replace the example methods, inputs, and assertions with the actual methods and logic from your `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet.py` file.  This will allow you to run thorough and accurate tests against your code. If you don't have a `spreadsheet.py` file, you need to comment out or remove the `TestSpreadsheet` class.
