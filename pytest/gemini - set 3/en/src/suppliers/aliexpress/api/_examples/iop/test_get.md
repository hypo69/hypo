**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Additions:**

* **Mock `execute`:** The original code made a real API call.  This is **extremely** problematic for testing because it depends on external resources.  Testing depends on known inputs and expected outputs.  The code now mocks the `execute` method, crucial for effective testing.  The `MockResponse` class mimics the expected response object.  You'll need to adjust the mock response values to match the API's expected response formats.  
* **`MockResponse` class:** This class defines a mock response object with the attributes that the original code uses.
* **Test `execute_response_attributes`:** This test verifies that the response object has the expected attributes. It's essential to check these because the `execute` method would need to successfully create an instance of a response object.
* **Comprehensive testing:** The addition of `test_request_creation`, `test_request_add_api_param`, and `test_request_set_simplify` provides more comprehensive testing of core functionalities beyond just the client response.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save:** Save the above code as `test_get.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `iop` module.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_get.py
    ```

Remember to replace the example mock response values in `test_execute_response_attributes` with the actual values your `execute` method would return in various scenarios.  Crucially, this is where you need to consider the valid return structures of `aliexpress.logistics.redefining.getlogisticsselleraddresses` for different statuses. For a real test, you'd need stubs, mocks, or an actual API response object for testing the method in various use cases (success and error).

This revised solution addresses the critical issue of external dependencies and provides a robust framework for testing the `iop` module's components.
