**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:** The crucial `os.getcwd()` call was creating an absolute path and trying to extract "hypotez" from it which might not be accurate if run from a different directory.  Now, the test directly sets `os.getcwd` to a known directory (`test_dir`), making the test's result predictable and avoiding external file access.

2. **Temporary Directory:**  Crucially, a temporary directory (`test_dir`) is created within the `mock_getcwd` and used in the test. This prevents side effects on subsequent tests and ensures the tests don't interfere with the user's system or other tests that might be run. The directory is cleaned up in the test fixture using `shutil.rmtree`.

3. **Clearer Error Handling:** The `test_header_dir_root` now uses `pytest.fail` with a descriptive message to handle potential `ValueError` that might arise during dir_root calculation in a more informative way.


4. **Mock sys.path:** A `mock_sys_path` function is added to mock `sys.path` during testing. This ensures that the tests are independent of the actual system's `sys.path`.

5. **`test_header_imports`:** This test is marked as skipped because it requires more context on the code to verify. You must provide the actual import statements and class definitions from `src` to be able to accurately test that `gs`, `Supplier`, etc. are imported without error.

6. **`pytest.fixture` for path mocking:** The `mock_path` fixture is created to consolidate the temporary directory creation, path mocking, and cleanup. This makes the tests more organized and easier to understand.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important:**  Replace the placeholder `# ...` comments in the original `header.py` with your actual code.  The example imports are crucial for the `test_header_imports` test and should be included in `header.py` for a complete example.  Without those imports, you will encounter errors as your actual code likely depends on these classes/modules. Also, remember to adapt the directory paths and mock the functions based on your specific use case. Remember to install the necessary packages for the tests: `pip install pytest`
