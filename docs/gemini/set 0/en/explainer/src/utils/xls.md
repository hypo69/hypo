""" This module provides functions to convert Excel files to JSON format, handle multiple sheets, and save JSON data back to Excel files.

Functions:
    read_xls_as_dict(xls_file: str, json_file: str = None, sheet_name: Union[str, int] = None) -> Union[Dict, List[Dict], bool]:
        Reads an Excel file and converts it to JSON.  Optionally, converts a specific sheet and saves the result to a JSON file.  Handles errors gracefully.

    save_xls_file(data: Dict[str, List[Dict]], file_path: str) -> bool:
        Saves JSON data to an Excel file.  The data should be a dictionary where keys are sheet names and values are lists of dictionaries representing rows. Handles errors gracefully.

Examples:
    # Reading and optionally saving to JSON
    data = read_xls_as_dict('input.xlsx', 'output.json', 'Sheet1')  # Reads sheet named 'Sheet1'
    if data:
        print(data)  # Output will be {'Sheet1': [{...}]}

    # Saving from JSON data
    data_to_save = {'Sheet1': [{'column1': 'value1', 'column2': 'value2'}]}
    success = save_xls_file(data_to_save, 'output.xlsx')
    if success:
        print("Successfully saved to output.xlsx")

## <algorithm>

**read_xls_as_dict Algorithm:**

1. **Input Validation:** Checks if the Excel file exists. If not, logs an error and returns `False`.
2. **File Reading:** Reads the Excel file using pandas.
3. **Sheet Selection:** If `sheet_name` is provided, reads the specified sheet; otherwise, reads all sheets.
4. **Data Conversion:** Converts each sheet to a dictionary of dictionaries (`data_dict`)
   - **Error Handling:** Wraps `pd.read_excel` in a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during sheet reading. Logs errors and returns `False` if an error occurs.
5. **JSON Output (Optional):** If `json_file` is provided, writes the `data_dict` to the specified JSON file.  Handles potential errors.  Logs success.
6. **Output:** Returns the `data_dict`. If any error occurs, returns `False`.

**save_xls_file Algorithm:**

1. **Input Validation:** This function doesn't explicitly validate the input data, but it implicitly relies on the `data` being in the expected format.
2. **File Creation:** Creates an Excel writer object using pandas.
3. **Data Writing:** Iterates through the input data (`data`).
   - **Data Framing:** Creates a pandas DataFrame from each sheet's data.
   - **Sheet Writing:** Writes the DataFrame to the Excel file with the corresponding sheet name. Handles potential errors. Logs success.
4. **Output:** Returns `True` on successful writing, `False` otherwise. Logs errors.

**Dependencies:**

- `pandas`: Used for reading and writing Excel files.
- `json`: Used for handling JSON data.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting.
- `pathlib`: Used for working with file paths.
- `logging`: Used for logging information and errors.

## <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `pandas as pd`: Essential for data manipulation and handling Excel files. It's used to read and write Excel data efficiently and to create DataFrames, which are crucial for structuring and processing spreadsheet data. Its relationship with `src.` packages is not explicitly defined in the provided code but is typically in the project's `requirements.txt` and it's directly imported, not from another package.
- `json`: Used for encoding/decoding JSON data. It enables the conversion to/from JSON format. The import is straightforward.
- `typing`: Provides type hints, improving code readability and maintainability. It's part of the Python standard library and does not need a specific project structure relation.
- `pathlib`: Simplifies path manipulation, making code more robust and platform-independent.  Its use is part of standard Python modules.
- `logging`: Used to log messages during the execution.  The relationship in the overall project might be that `xls.py` logs events/messages that another part of the project needs to access and react to, this is not explicit.

**Classes:**

- No classes are defined in this code, only functions.

**Functions:**

- `read_xls_as_dict`: Takes an Excel file path, optional JSON file path, and optional sheet name as input. It reads the Excel file using pandas.  It handles the cases where a specific sheet or all sheets are to be converted and saved to a JSON file.  Error handling is robust: it catches `FileNotFoundError` and general exceptions, logging appropriate messages. Crucially, it returns `False` to indicate failure.  This function is responsible for reading the Excel file.
- `save_xls_file`: Takes a dictionary of sheet names mapped to lists of dictionaries (representing Excel rows) and an output file path. It creates an Excel file using pandas' `ExcelWriter`, and handles potential exceptions during this process.  Crucially, it returns `True` or `False` to indicate success or failure.  This function is responsible for converting the JSON data into an Excel file.


**Variables:**

- `MODE`: A string variable defining the application mode ('dev' in this case). Not used in the function itself.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

- **Data validation:** The `save_xls_file` function could benefit from more validation to ensure the input data is in the correct format. The current handling could silently fail if there are issues with the data structure.  This is critical because data consistency is important.
- **Large files:** Handling very large Excel files might require memory management Startegies to prevent crashes.
- **Error Logging:** Include more detailed error messages for better debugging.  The messages are general and could be improved for specific error conditions.
- **File Overwriting:** While not an error, the code assumes that the JSON file and the output excel file is not being used by another application simultaneously.  If these files are open, problems could occur.

**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

The `xls.py` module is likely part of a larger project that handles data processing.  It provides utility functions for converting data between Excel and JSON, allowing other modules to perform data manipulation tasks on these formats.  It assumes that `pandas` and `json` libraries are available and installed, and that the file paths provided are valid.  The functions in this module are designed to be used by other modules in the project, making this an appropriate utility module.
