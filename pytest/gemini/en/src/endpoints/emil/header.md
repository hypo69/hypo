**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the scenario being tested.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes a test `test_set_project_root_no_project_root` to address the potential for `AttributeError` if the project root isn't found. This crucial edge case was missing in the previous response.
* **Dummy Directory Setup:** Creates temporary directories for testing with different marker file configurations.  This isolates the tests and prevents side effects.
* **Error Types:** Uses `pytest.raises` to specifically test exception handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `TypeError`.  Critically, it tests for the correct *type* of exception.
* **Cleanup:** Includes `shutil.rmtree()` to remove the temporary test directories after the tests. This is essential for preventing test failures and conflicts in subsequent test runs.
* **Correctness:**  Tests the cases with marker files present or absent, including testing scenarios where the path itself doesn't exist.



**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the tests:** Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved solution addresses the potential errors and provides a comprehensive test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adapt the test cases to handle more complex logic or specific needs in the original code. Importantly, it provides tests for all possible failure conditions and verifies both expected and unexpected return values.
