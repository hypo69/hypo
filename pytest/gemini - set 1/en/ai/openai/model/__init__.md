```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.ai.openai.model import MODE, OpenAIModel

# Tests for the MODE constant
def test_mode_value():
    """Tests the value of the MODE constant."""
    assert MODE == 'development'


# Tests for the OpenAIModel class (assuming there are methods in the class)
# Since the provided code only imports the OpenAIModel class,
# we need to assume methods and add tests accordingly.


def test_openai_model_default_values():
  """Test default values of OpenAIModel (assuming any)"""
  # Replace with the actual default value and attributes if available
  model = OpenAIModel()
  assert model.some_attribute is None  # or the default value
  assert model.some_other_attribute == 0 # or the default value



# Example tests assuming methods exist:
def test_openai_model_method_valid_input():
    """Test a method with valid input (example)."""
    model = OpenAIModel()
    # Replace 'some_method' and arguments with actual method and arguments
    result = model.some_method("some_input")
    assert result == "expected_output"  # Replace with expected output


def test_openai_model_method_invalid_input():
    """Test a method with invalid input (example)."""
    model = OpenAIModel()
    # Replace 'some_method' and arguments with actual method and arguments
    with pytest.raises(TypeError): #Example of exception handling
        model.some_method(123) #Replace with example of invalid input


# Example with edge case testing:
def test_openai_model_method_edge_case():
    """Test a method with an edge case input."""
    model = OpenAIModel()
    # Replace 'some_method' and arguments with actual method and arguments
    result = model.some_method("")  # Example edge case: empty string
    assert result == "expected_output_for_empty_string"


#Important:  These tests are placeholders! You need to adapt them
# based on the actual methods and attributes of your OpenAIModel class.
# If there are no methods, attributes, or other functions to test
# then your test suite would be very small.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing Implementation:** The provided code only imports `OpenAIModel`.  Crucially, there's no implementation for the class.  The tests above are _placeholder_ tests. You must replace the example method names (`some_method`, `some_attribute`), inputs, and expected outputs with the actual methods, attributes, and expected behavior of your `OpenAIModel` class.  Without knowing the functionality of the model, the tests are incomplete.


2. **Exception Handling:** The `test_openai_model_method_invalid_input` shows how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (like `TypeError`). This is crucial for robust testing.


3. **Edge Cases:** The `test_openai_model_method_edge_case` example demonstrates how to test edge cases.  This might be an empty string, a very large number, a specific format, or some other unusual input.

4. **Data Driven Tests:** If the OpenAI model has many methods that operate similarly on different kinds of input data, you could use pytest fixtures to supply this data, enabling data-driven testing approaches to increase the test coverage.

5. **Completeness:**  To be truly comprehensive, you'd need test cases for every method, constructor, attribute, and valid and invalid inputs your class offers.


**How to Use These Tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_openai_model.py`).
2. **Run pytest:** Open your terminal and run `pytest test_openai_model.py` to execute the tests. pytest will report the results.


Remember to replace the example code with your actual `OpenAIModel` class implementation for these tests to be useful.
