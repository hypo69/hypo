# Received Code

```python
# Your task is create many contexts that will be used as base to generate a list of persons.
# The idea is receive a broad context, with some  details of persons we want to generate,
# like demographics parameters, physical characteristics, behaviors, believes, etc; and
# then create many other contexts, more specifics, but derivaded of the more generic one.
# Your response must be an array in JSON format. Each element of the array must be a
# context that will be used to generate a person description.
#
# Example:
#   - INPUT:
#     Please, generate 3 person(s) description(s) based on the following broad context:
#     Latin American, age between 20 and 40 years old, economic status can vary
#     between poor and rich, it can be religious or not, it can be married or not,
#     it can have children or not, it can be a professional or not, it can be a worker or not
#   - OUTPUT:
#     ["Mexican person that has formed as lawyer but now works in other are, is single,
#      like sports and movies", "Create a Brazilian person that is a doctor, like pets and
#      the nature and love heavy metal.", "Create a Colombian person that is a lawyer,
#      like to read and drink coffee and is married with 2 children."]
```

# Changes Made

*   Added docstrings to the `generate_person_contexts` function using reStructuredText (RST) format, including type hints, parameter descriptions, and return value descriptions.
*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error handling.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (or `j_loads_ns`) to handle potential errors.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for better error reporting.
*   Improved variable and function names for better readability.
*   Added a `ValueError` check for input type validation.
*   Added `try-except` blocks for JSON decoding errors.
*   Added placeholder comments (`# ...`) where code logic was not specified in the example prompt.
*   Example implementation to illuStarte how to return a list of contexts based on a broad context.
