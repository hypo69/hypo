```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. **Import function:** The code starts by importing the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.  This step brings the necessary functionality for calculating sums into the current scope.

   * **Example:**  If `src.utils.calculator` contains a function `calculate_sum` defined as `def calculate_sum(x, y): return x + y`, this step makes `calculate_sum` available for use in `add_numbers`.


2. **Define `add_numbers` function:** A function named `add_numbers` is defined. This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers.


   * **Example:**  Calling `add_numbers(3, 5)` would pass the values 3 and 5 to the function.


3. **Call `calculate_sum`:** Inside the `add_numbers` function, the `calculate_sum` function is called with the arguments `a` and `b`.  This means that `calculate_sum` takes the values of `a` and `b` and calculates their sum.


   * **Example:** If `a = 3` and `b = 5`, the function call would become `calculate_sum(3, 5)`.


4. **Return result:** The result of the `calculate_sum` function call is stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the function returns the value of `result`.


   * **Example:** If `calculate_sum(3, 5)` returns 8, then `add_numbers(3, 5)` returns 8.

**Imports:**

* `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `utils` subdirectory of the `src` directory. This implies that the `calculator` module likely contains other utility functions related to calculations. The `src` directory likely represents the source code base of the project.


**Function `add_numbers`:**

* **Purpose:** The function `add_numbers` serves as a simple wrapper around the `calculate_sum` function, providing an interface for adding two numbers.


* **Arguments:**
    * `a` (number): The first number to be added.
    * `b` (number): The second number to be added.


* **Return value:** The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.


**Relationship with other packages:**

* `src.utils.calculator`: This module likely contains other related functions or classes for mathematical operations.  The `utils` folder is a good place for functions and classes that are intended for use across different parts of the project.



**Potential Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code could benefit from input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are valid numbers.  For example, checking if they are integers or floats, and handling cases where they are not numbers.
* **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) would improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand the expected types of inputs and outputs.
* **Docstrings:** Adding docstrings to the `add_numbers` function would improve documentation and make it clear what the function does, what arguments it accepts, and what value it returns.


**Variables:**

* `result`:  This variable holds the result of the calculation performed by `calculate_sum`.  Its type will be the same as the return type of `calculate_sum`.


**In summary:** The code is simple and functional.  Adding error handling, type hints, and docstrings would make it more robust and easier to maintain.
