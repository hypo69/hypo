# Telegram Bot for Hypotez

This document describes the `TelegramBot` class, a Python class responsible for creating and managing a Telegram bot.  The bot handles various message types, including text, documents, and voice messages, and provides a basic set of commands.


## File: `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/bot.py`

This Python file implements the Telegram bot functionality.  It utilizes the `python-telegram-bot` library for interacting with the Telegram API.


### Classes

* **`TelegramBot`**:
    * **`__init__(self, token: str)`**: Initializes the Telegram bot application with the provided API token.  This is crucial for the bot to authenticate and interact with Telegram.
    * **`start(self, update: Update, context: CallbackContext)`**: Handles the `/start` command, sending a welcome message to the user.
    * **`help_command(self, update: Update, context: CallbackContext)`**: Handles the `/help` command, displaying available commands.
    * **`handle_document(self, update: Update, context: CallbackContext)`**: Handles incoming documents.  It downloads the document to a temporary file and reads its text content using `read_text_file` (from `src.utils.file`).  Crucially, it handles potential errors with a better error message than simply crashing.  **Important:**  This function assumes the document is a text file.
    * **`handle_message(self, update: Update, context: CallbackContext)`**: Handles incoming text messages. Returns the received text.
    * **`handle_voice(self, update: Update, context: CallbackContext)`**: Handles incoming voice messages. It uses the `speech_recognizer` function from `src.utils.convertors.tts` to transcribe the audio to text. This function should handle the case where speech recognition fails.


### Functions

* **`main()`**:
    * Retrieves the bot token from `gs.credentials.telegram.bot.kazarinov`.  This assumes a configuration file or similar is in place, containing the necessary credentials.
    * Creates a `TelegramBot` instance.
    * Registers command handlers (`start`, `help`) and message handlers (text, voice, document).  This is critical for the bot to respond appropriately to various user inputs.
    * Runs the bot's `polling` loop, continuously listening for updates.


### Dependencies

* `python-telegram-bot`: For interacting with the Telegram API.
* `pathlib`: For working with file paths.
* `tempfile`: For creating temporary files.
* `asyncio`: For asynchronous operations.
* `requests`: For downloading files.
* Other modules likely from the `hypotez` project for tasks like speech recognition, text reading, and accessing configuration (`gs`, `logger`, `j_loads`, etc).  It's essential to have a clear understanding of the other modules this script depends on.


### Usage

1.  Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
2.  Configure the bot token (`gs.credentials.telegram.bot.kazarinov`) in the corresponding configuration file.
3.  Run the script. The bot will start listening for messages on Telegram.


### Improvements and Considerations

* **Error Handling:** The `handle_document` function could be improved by providing a more user-friendly message if the file isn't a text file or if there's an issue reading the file.  The `handle_voice` function should also handle cases where speech recognition fails.
* **Logging:**  Include logging statements within the various handler functions for debugging.
* **File Types:** The `handle_document` function currently only supports text documents. Consider adding more flexible handling to handle documents of different types.
* **Security:**  Store sensitive data like bot tokens securely (e.g., environment variables).
* **File Size:**  Limit the size of the documents that can be handled to prevent exceeding resource limitations.
* **Robust Speech Recognition:**  The `speech_recognizer` function is a black box. Include error handling and logging to diagnose problems during speech recognition.
* **Context:** Provide context to the user in cases of failure. This improves the user experience and helps in debugging.
