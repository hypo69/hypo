#For example, if get_products returns a specific structured object, you'll need
#assertions to test the various attributes of that object.



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `Graber`:** Corrected the import statement to be more specific and match the file location.

2. **Example Data:** Included example data for testing (crucial for real tests). Replace these placeholders with appropriate data from your `ebay` module.


3. **Fixture for `Graber`:** Created a `graber_instance` fixture to reuse Graber object in all test functions, promoting test isolation and avoiding repeated object instantiation.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for `get_products` covering valid input, empty search term, no results scenarios, invalid URLs, and empty URLs. Includes proper exception handling using `pytest.raises`.

5. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are added to check that the returned data has the expected type and structure (e.g., `isinstance(products, list)`).

6. **Edge Cases:** Tests are added to cover edge cases like empty search terms and cases where no products are found.  This is critical.


7. **Invalid URL Testing:** Added `test_graber_get_products_invalid_url` and `test_graber_get_product_details_invalid_url` to test failure cases with invalid URLs, essential for robust error handling.


8. **`get_product_details` Test Cases:** Includes a test for `get_product_details` with valid and invalid URLs for completeness.

9. **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` correctly to test for expected exceptions when encountering invalid URLs and catches the appropriate exception (a common error in initial implementations).

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_ebay.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay` module.

2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_ebay.py`

**Critical Next Steps:**

- **Replace placeholders:**  The example data (`EXAMPLE_SEARCH_TERM`, `EXAMPLE_VALID_URL`, etc.) needs to be replaced with realistic data from your eBay API or data source.

- **Complete `Graber` Testing:** Add tests for any other functions or methods in your `Graber` class. These should cover different input types, possible errors, and edge cases for your specific implementation.  


- **Mocking:** Consider using `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for more sophisticated testing of external dependencies (e.g., if your `Graber` class depends on an external API).  This can make your tests faster and avoid hitting external APIs during testing.
