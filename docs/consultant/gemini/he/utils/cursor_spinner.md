**Changes Made**

*   Added missing `import logger` from `src.logger` to handle errors appropriately.
*   Added more comprehensive docstrings using RST format to all functions and the module.
*   Improved the exception handling in the `show_spinner` function. Now it catches `Exception` and logs the error using `logger`.
*   Added a `TODO` to the `show_spinner` function to indicate potential improvements for specific error handling.
*   Added a docstring to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to describe its purpose.
