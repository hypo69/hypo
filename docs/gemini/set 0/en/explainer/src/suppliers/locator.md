# Field Locators on the `HTML` Page

### Example Locator:

```json
  "close_banner": {
    "attribute": null, 
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//button[@id = 'closeXButton']",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": false,
    "event": "click()",
    "locator_description": "Closes the pop-up window. If it doesn’t appear, it’s not critical (`mandatory`:`false`)."
  },
  "additional_images_urls": {
    "attribute": "src",
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//ol[contains(@class, 'flex-control-thumbs')]//img",
    "if_list": "all",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": false,
    "event": null,
    "locator_description": "Retrieves a list of `URL`s for additional images."
  },
  "id_supplier": {
    "attribute": "innerText",
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//span[@class = 'ltr sku-copy']",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": true,
    "event": null,
    "locator_description": "SKU for Morlevi."
  },
  "default_image_url": {
    "attribute": null,
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//a[@id = 'mainpic']//img",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "event": "screenshot()",
    "mandatory": true,
    "locator_description": "Attention! In Morlevi, the image is captured via a screenshot and returned as a PNG (`bytes`)."
  }
```

### <algorithm>

1. **Locator Definition:**  The code defines various locators for web elements on an HTML page.  Each locator is a dictionary containing parameters that specify how to find a specific element.

    *Example*: `close_banner` defines how to locate and potentially click the banner close button.

2. **Locator Attributes Extraction:**  The locators define different attributes to retrieve from the located web element.

    *Example*: The `additional_images_urls` locator extracts the `src` attribute (image URLs).

3. **Element Location Strategy:**  `by` specifies the method to locate the element.  Common strategies are using XPath.

    *Example*:  `close_banner` uses XPath to locate a button with ID `closeXButton`.

4. **Element Handling (if_list):**  `if_list` determines how to handle multiple elements found by the selector.  It can return the first, all, or last matching element.

    *Example*:  `additional_images_urls` returns all matching img tags within the given selector.


5. **Mouse Interaction (use_mouse):** This flag determines if the locator involves mouse actions.


6. **Mandatory (mandatory):**  Defines if an element is crucial to the process.

    *Example*: `id_supplier` and `default_image_url` are considered mandatory, raising an error if not found.

7. **Event Execution (event):** If present, the WebDriver executes the defined event before obtaining the attribute.

    *Example*: The `default_image_url` locator has a screenshot action, which will be performed before getting the element information.

### <explanation>

* **Imports**: There are no direct imports in this code snippet. The code assumes it's part of a larger project that imports necessary libraries like Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web elements.

* **Classes**:  This code defines locator *data*, not classes. The locators are stored as dictionaries, which are used to define how to find and interact with elements on a webpage.  A `ProductFields` class, mentioned, is likely part of the project to represent product data; however, the code details only the data for locating elements, not the use of those elements in any program logic.

* **Functions**: This code defines no functions. Locators define actions and attributes, but no function calls are present here.

* **Variables**:  All elements are dictionaries, and the values within those dictionaries are used to define the locators.  The locator names (e.g., `close_banner`) are essentially variable names within the broader data structure.

* **Potential Errors/Improvements**: The code is well-structured and provides clear definitions for element locators. However,  a crucial part of robust web automation is error handling. The code assumes the elements exist and can be located without checking for failures like elements not found, or unexpected errors during the `event` actions.

* **Relationships with other parts of the project**: This part defines data that will be used in methods in a `ProductFields` class. This data tells how to retrieve specific data from webpages, likely in tests or data extraction processes.  A common use case would be a larger script that uses this data to retrieve product information and check against expected values.


**Data Flow Relationships:** The locators are used in larger scripts or programs that interact with the web elements. A `ProductFields` object, probably in a different part of the code, would likely use these locators to query, extract, and verify data in the UI. Therefore, the data flow from the locators (`HTML` definition) goes into the methods of the `ProductFields` class, enabling retrieving the data needed.
