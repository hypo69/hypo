\n**Prompt for generating `how to` documentation for code blocks**\n
\n1. You need to analyze the current block of code and all previously loaded code blocks in the project. Based on this analysis, you will create a step-by-step instruction that describes what actions need to be taken to execute the given code block.\n
\n2. For each code block, you should create a detailed instruction in reStructuredText (RST) format, following these steps:\n
\n    - **Description**: Explain what this code block does, for example, what task it solves or what validation it performs.\n
    - **Execution steps**: Describe the sequence of actions that need to be performed for the code to execute. For each step, explain in detail what happens during the process.\n
    - **Usage example**: Provide an example of how this code can be used in the project, including possible function or method calls.\n
\n3. The structure of the documentation for each code block should be as follows:\n
\n```rst\nHow to use this code block\n=========================================================================================\n
\nDescription\n-------------------------\nThis code block performs [describe the actions of the code block, for example, "a validation check on input data"].\n
\nExecution steps\n-------------------------\n1. [First step, for example, "Retrieve data by calling the `get_data()` function."]\n
2. [Second step, for example, "Validate the data using the `validate_data()` method."]\n
3. [Third step, for example, "If the data is valid, further processing is performed."]\n
4. [Continue as needed...]\n
\nUsage example\n-------------------------\nAn example of how to use this code block in a project:\n
\n.. code-block:: python\n
\n    <example_code_usage>\n```\n
\n4. When writing documentation, be sure to:\n
\n    - If the code block performs a check, describe how it works and what data is being validated.\n
    - If the code block calls other functions or methods, be sure to specify which functions are called and with what parameters.\n
    - Use precise wording, avoiding vague terms like "getting" or "doing." Instead, describe what the code specifically does: "the code checks," "the code sends a request," and so on.\n
\n5. Example for a code block that performs a variable check:\n
\n```rst\nHow to use this code block\n=========================================================================================\n
\nDescription\n-------------------------\nThis code block performs a validation check on the `value` variable before further processing.\n
\nExecution steps\n-------------------------\n1. Retrieve the value of the `value` variable by calling the `get_value()` method.\n
2. Check if the value is empty or invalid. If so, log an error message and halt execution.\n
3. If the value is valid, pass it to the next function for further processing.\n
\nUsage example\n-------------------------\nAn example of how to use this code block:\n
\n.. code-block:: python\n
\n    value = get_value()\n
    if value:\n
        process_value(value)\n
    else:\n
        logger.error(\'Invalid value\')\n```\n
\n6. Each code block should be documented in this format, with clear and understandable steps explaining what the code does and with an example of how it can be used.\n
\n---\n
\nThis prompt gives you the instructions to create detailed documentation for each code block based on its analysis. You will generate documentation that explains the sequence of actions for executing the code, as well as provide usage examples."""
