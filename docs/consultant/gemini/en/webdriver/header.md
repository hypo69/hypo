**Changes Made:**

*   Imported `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for reading the `settings.json` file.
*   Added type hints and docstrings in RST format to the `get_project_root` function.
*   Improved error handling for `settings.json` loading, using `try-except` block and `j_loads` for better error handling and prevents crashes if the file is missing or corrupted.
*   Used `pathlib.Path` consistently for file paths, making the code more robust and readable.
*   Added `encoding='utf-8'` parameter to `read_text` to properly handle README.MD encoding.
*   Handles the case where `settings` is `None` by defaulting to an empty dictionary.
*   Fixes a potential issue with `sys.path` where it wouldn't be added if `root_path` wasn't present in it.
*   Corrected variable name `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
*   Improved clarity and consistency of variable names.
*   Included more comprehensive docstrings for better documentation.


This revised code is more robust, handles potential errors gracefully, and adheres to the requested best practices. It's also more readable and maintainable due to the improved structure and comments. Remember to create the `src/utils/jjson.py` file containing the `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` functions if they are not already present. Also, the code now assumes that `pyproject.toml` exists in the same directory as the file.  If that's not the case, you should adjust the search logic in `get_project_root` to accomodate the location.
