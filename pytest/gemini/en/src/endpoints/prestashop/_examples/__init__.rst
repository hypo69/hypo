**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:**  Corrected import statements to import from the provided `version.py` file.

2. **Specific Test Cases:**  Added tests for `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` directly.

3. **Data Type Verification:** Checks if the variables have the correct data types (e.g., `__version__` is a `Version` object, `__doc__` is a string).

4. **Empty String Check:** Added a test to ensure `__doc__` isn't an empty string.

5. **Dictionary Check:** Added a test to ensure `__details__` is a dictionary and added a placeholder for further key checks.  Critically, you **need to fill in** the specific assertions based on the expected keys and values in your actual `__details__` dictionary.

6. **MODE Variable:** Added tests for `MODE`.

7. **Example Fixtures:** Provided a placeholder for example fixtures. If there are functions that take arguments in the module you need to add corresponding fixtures for test.


**How to Use and Adapt:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Update the placeholder assertions (`assert __version__ == "0.1.0"`, etc.) with the actual expected values or conditions from your code.  Crucially, the assertions for `__details__` must match the actual structure and contents of that dictionary.
- **Add Function Tests:**  If your code has other functions, add tests for them using similar structure. Create appropriate fixtures for them, if needed.
- **Handle Edge Cases:** Add more tests for different inputs, boundary values, and scenarios that might cause errors or unexpected behavior.


This improved example provides a much more comprehensive and practical starting point for testing your code. Remember to replace the placeholders with the specific details from your `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/_examples/__init__.py` file. Remember to run `pytest` in your terminal to execute these tests. Remember to add imports to any specific libraries used in the actual function tested.
