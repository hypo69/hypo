**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Methods and Attributes:** The example tests now contain placeholders (`get_products(category_id=...)`).  **Replace these with the actual methods and attributes** from your `PrestaShop` class.  Crucially, you need to understand what data `PrestaShop` expects and returns.

2. **Error Handling:** The `test_prestashop_method_with_invalid_input` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions. **Replace `"Invalid category ID"` with the actual error message** your code raises.

3. **Edge Cases:** The examples include tests for empty input and maximum/minimum values. Adapt these to the specific input requirements of your `PrestaShop` class methods.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions like `assert result is not None` are more specific than just `assert result`.  This helps clarify the expected behavior.

5. **Fixture (Example):** If you need to create a `PrestaShop` instance multiple times in different tests, a fixture, as shown, can be highly beneficial.

6. **Completeness:** The tests are still basic examples.  You **need to add more test cases to cover all possible inputs, exceptions, and edge cases** your code might encounter.  This requires a deep understanding of the `PrestaShop` class's methods and expected behaviors.

**Before running these tests:**

- **Ensure the `PrestaShop` class and its methods are correctly implemented** in the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/__init__.py` file.
- **Understand what data `PrestaShop` expects and returns** from its methods.  For example, what are the expected types for parameters (e.g., integers, strings)?  What does it return when it succeeds?


By filling in the placeholders and adding more comprehensive tests, you'll have a much more robust test suite. Remember to thoroughly consider various possible input scenarios, including edge cases, and tailor the assertions to match the expected outcomes of your code. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
