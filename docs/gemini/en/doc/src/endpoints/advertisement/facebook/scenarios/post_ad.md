# src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.scenarios.post_ad

## Overview

This module provides functionality for posting advertisements on Facebook groups. It handles sending advertisement titles, uploading media, and publishing the post.


## Functions

### `post_ad`

**Description**: This function orchestrates the entire advertisement posting process, including sending the title, uploading media (if available), and publishing the post.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): The Selenium WebDriver instance used for interacting with the Facebook page.
- `message` (SimpleNamespace): A `SimpleNamespace` object containing the advertisement details, including the title, description, and image path (if any).

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the advertisement was posted successfully, `None` if there was an error in sending the title or publishing.

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: In the case of unforeseen errors during any of the subprocesses.

**Example Usage**:

```python
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.scenarios import post_ad
from types import SimpleNamespace

# Assuming you have a Driver instance named 'driver' and an event object 'event'
driver = Driver(...)
event = SimpleNamespace(title="Campaign Title", description="Event Description", image_path = "path/to/image.jpg")

success = post_ad(driver, event)

if success:
    print("Advertisement posted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to post advertisement.")
```

**Implementation Details**:

1.  Calls `post_message_title` to send the advertisement title.  If unsuccessful, increments a failure counter (`fails`) and potentially returns early.
2.  If an `image_path` is provided, calls `upload_post_media` to upload the image.
3.  Calls `message_publish` to publish the post.
4.  Resets the failure counter (`fails`) if the post is successful.
5.  Returns `True` if the advertisement posting process completes successfully.


**Error Handling:**

The function includes a `try...except` block for error handling. If any of the subprocesses (`post_message_title`, `upload_post_media`, or `message_publish`) encounter exceptions, the error is logged using `logger.error` and `exc_info=False` is used to avoid unnecessary traceback prints and potential application crashes.  This approach helps to provide a more robust advertisement posting experience.
