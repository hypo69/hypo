How to use the `hypotez/src/product/product_fields/__init__.py` module

This module provides classes and functions for handling product fields in the Hypotez system.  It's part of the broader product management system.

**Key components:**

* **`ProductFields` class:**  This class likely encapsulates data related to product fields.  Further documentation within the `product_fields.py` file would detail the structure and methods available for manipulating product field data.

* **`translate_presta_fields_dict` function:** This function is responsible for translating fields from a potentially different format (presumably from a platform like PrestaShop) into a format usable by the Hypotez system. The input to this function is a dictionary (`dict`).  Further documentation would explain the expected input format and what data the function returns.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**


```python
# Assuming you've imported necessary modules
from hypotez.src.product.product_fields import ProductFields, translate_presta_fields_dict

# Example input (replace with your actual PrestaShop data)
presta_fields = {
    'id_product': 123,
    'name': 'Example Product',
    'price': 19.99
}

# Translate the fields
translated_fields = translate_presta_fields_dict(presta_fields)


# Now you can use the translated data.
# Create a ProductFields object (example)
product_fields_instance = ProductFields(translated_fields)


# Access fields, e.g.
#print(product_fields_instance.name)  # Assuming a 'name' field exists.

# Other operations (e.g. adding, updating, saving product fields) will depend on the methods defined in the ProductFields class.
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The provided code snippet lacks error handling.  Robust code should include `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during the translation process and data manipulation.
* **Input Validation:** The `translate_presta_fields_dict` function should validate the input dictionary to ensure it contains the expected keys and values.
* **`ProductFields` Class Details:** The `ProductFields` class's methods and attributes need to be documented within the `product_fields.py` module to fully understand how to work with this class.

**To get more specific instructions on how to use the module:**

1. **Inspect `product_fields.py`:** The full implementation of the `ProductFields` class will dictate what methods are available for creating, manipulating, and accessing product fields.  The documentation, comments, and examples in this file are crucial for understanding the class's purpose.
2. **Review `product_fields_translator.py`:**  This file likely contains details on the `translate_presta_fields_dict` function, including its specific logic, input format, and return format.
