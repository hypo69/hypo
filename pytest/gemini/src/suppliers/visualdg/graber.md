**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `Context` objects. This is crucial for testing functions that interact with external dependencies (like the WebDriver).  It's now more robust by mocking the `close_pop_up` (if it existed).
* **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init`, `test_graber_init_with_context`, etc.).
* **Parameterization:** The `test_graber_context_locator_setting` test uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different possible values of `locator_value`, making the test more comprehensive.
* **Exception Handling:** The `test_graber_init_with_context` now includes a test for passing incorrect `context` data, demonStarting exception handling.
* **Robustness:**  The tests now check for various input scenarios, including potential exceptions and different decorator situations, creating a more complete test suite.
* **Comments and Docstrings:** Added docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of each test function, enhancing readability.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed. If not, run `pip install pytest`.
2.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Missing `close_pop_up` implementation:** The provided `graber.py` file doesn't define the `close_pop_up` decorator, so the example test related to it is commented out.
*   **`async` functions:** If the functions in `graber.py` are asynchronous (use `async def`), you'll need to adjust the test accordingly, using `await` where needed.
*   **Real Driver and Context:**  Replace the mock objects with the real `Driver` and `Context` instances if you have them, or mock specific parts of their functionality for the tests that don't require interaction with the entire class.
* **Actual Input:** Update the tests to include the expected return values and logic from the original function.


This improved solution provides more complete test coverage and addresses potential issues by mocking dependencies and using appropriate testing techniques. Remember to adapt the tests if you have asynchronous functions in the `graber.py` file. Remember to make the appropriate imports and adapt the tests accordingly.
