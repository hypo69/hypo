Description
-------------------------
This document outlines the style guide for documenting Python code using reStructuredText (RST) format.  The guide covers best practices for modules, classes, functions/methods, and exception handling within code comments.  It emphasizes clarity, conciseness, and consistency in documenting code behavior.

Execution Steps
-------------------------
1.  **Module Documentation:**  For each module, include a descriptive header explaining its overall purpose. Include examples of using the module (if applicable) within `.. code-block:: python` blocks. Specify the platforms supported and a brief synopsis.  Use RST headers for attributes and methods within the module.
2.  **Class Documentation:**  Each class should be documented with a header describing its purpose.  Include sections for class attributes and methods, with clear explanations of their purpose, usage examples, and detailed RST-formatted descriptions for parameters and return values.
3.  **Function/Method Documentation:** Document every function or method with a clear description of its purpose. Include detailed descriptions for parameters, return values, and usage examples, formatted as `.. code-block:: python` blocks.
4.  **Code Comments:** Embed RST-formatted comments within the code blocks themselves. Comments should explain the logic, rationale, and decisions made in the code. Avoid overly verbose or unnecessary comments. Use comments to describe the purpose of code sections, not just individual lines.
5.  **Exception Handling Documentation:** Document exception handling for classes, methods, and functions. Explicitly state which exceptions might be raised, under what conditions, and provide detailed information about the exception parameters (like the specific error message).  Follow the same RST formatting as for other elements.
6. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style for all RST-formatted comments throughout your codebase.  Using the provided examples as models is crucial for readability and maintainability.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example of a module-level comment
    # This module provides a simple class for working with files.

    # Import statements (if any)
    import os

    class FileProcessor:
        """
        This class is used to process files.

        Attributes:
        ----------
        file_path : str
            Path to the file being processed.
        """
        def __init__(self, file_path):
            """
            Initializes the FileProcessor with the file path.

            Parameters:
            -----------
            file_path : str
                Path to the file.
            """
            self.file_path = file_path


        def process_file(self):
            """
            Processes the file.

            Returns:
            --------
            bool
                True if file was processed, False if an error occurred.

            Raises:
            ------
            FileNotFoundError
                If the file does not exist.
            """
            try:
                with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                    # Do processing here...
                    return True
            except FileNotFoundError as ex:
                print(f"Error: {ex}")
                return False
