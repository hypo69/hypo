# async - Asynchronous Utility

This README describes the `async` module, a utility library for working with asynchronous JavaScript.  It's designed for use with Node.js but can be used in browsers as well.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install async
```

**Documentation:**

For comprehensive documentation, including examples and API details, please refer to the official website: <https://caolan.github.io/async/>

**Key Features:**

* **Straightforward and Powerful:** Provides functions for handling asynchronous tasks efficiently and in a readable manner.
* **Node.js and Browser Compatibility:**  Works in both Node.js environments and in browsers.  A pure ESM version (`async-es`) is also available for modern bundlers.
* **Concurrency Control:**  Allows you to manage the number of concurrent operations with `mapLimit` and other functions.

**Example Usage (Node.js):**

```javascript
const async = require('async');
const fs = require('fs');

const obj = {
  dev: '/dev.json',
  test: '/test.json',
  prod: '/prod.json'
};
const configs = {};

async.forEachOf(obj, (value, key, callback) => {
  fs.readFile(__dirname + value, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) return callback(err);
    try {
      configs[key] = JSON.parse(data);
    } catch (e) {
      return callback(e);
    }
    callback();
  });
}, (err) => {
  if (err) console.error(err.message);
  // configs is now a map of JSON data
  doSomethingWith(configs);
});

```

**Example Usage (Browser with ESM/MJS):**

```javascript
import async from 'async';  // Assuming the module is properly imported

// ... (your async code using async functions)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The examples demonstrate robust error handling using `callback` functions.  Always check for errors in your asynchronous operations.
* **Concurrency:**  Use `mapLimit` to control the number of concurrent operations and prevent resource exhaustion, especially when interacting with external services.
* **Browser Compatibility:**  Ensure your bundler (like Webpack or Rollup) is configured correctly to handle ESM imports if using this library in the browser.

This README provides a clearer and more structured overview of the `async` module.  Be sure to consult the official documentation for the most up-to-date information and complete API details. Remember to replace placeholders like `__dirname + value` with your actual file paths.
