**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the aspect being tested (e.g., `test_version_type`, `test_mode_value_dev`).

2. **Type Checking:**  Tests now verify the expected types of `__version__`, `MODE`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`. This is crucial for ensuring that the module's internal state is consistent.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  The example for exception handling now demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.

4. **`details_data` Fixture:** A `details_data` fixture is introduced, making the test for the `__details__` dictionary more robust.  A test fixture for edge case data (`edge_case_data`) is also outlined.

5. **Missing Function Test Example:**  Added a commented-out example of testing for a missing function to show how to handle undefined methods in a robust way. This is commented out as the provided code doesn't have any functions to test.

6. **Edge Case Testing Example:** The example of testing for edge cases is included in the code, commented out, for scenarios that might apply to actual functions.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_extentions.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_extentions.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Mock Data:**  If `__details__` contains complex data or interacts with external resources, you'll likely need to create a mock object or fixture for it, as demonstrated in `details_data` to make the tests more robust and independent.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** Adapt these tests to reflect the actual functionality of the functions in your code.  The examples for edge cases and exception testing are provided for you to include if they are applicable to the `__init__.py` code. If the Python code has more complex functions or interactions, you would need to create more detailed tests to cover these.

By including this level of detail and using test fixtures, your test suite will be far more effective and robust in uncovering potential issues. Remember to adapt and expand on these tests based on the functions you need to verify in the `__init__.py` file.
