**Improved Code**

```javascript
/* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
 * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
 * file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. */

// namespace
//  This code defines a namespace for XPath functions.
if (typeof tryxpath === 'undefined') {
    var tryxpath = {};
}

//  Variable to track if the content is loaded.  Note: This is not properly implemented
//  as it doesn't have a way to set the value or check its state, and is likely
//  not used.
tryxpath.isContentLoaded;

```

**Changes Made**

*   Added a comment explaining the purpose of the namespace.
*   Added a comment explaining the purpose of the variable `tryxpath.isContentLoaded`.
*   Replaced `!tryxpath` with `typeof tryxpath === 'undefined'` to check for the existence of the variable in a more robust way.
*   Improved readability of the code by using more descriptive comments.  This is a very basic implementation and would require a lot more context to truly understand what it's trying to do, and thus requires further commentary.
*   Added comments on the namespace's definition and the undefined variable check.
