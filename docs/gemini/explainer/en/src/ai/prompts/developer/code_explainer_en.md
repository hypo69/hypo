<input code>
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. **Import**: The code imports the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.


2. **Function Definition**: A function named `add_numbers` is defined.  This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.


3. **Calculation**: Inside the function, `calculate_sum(a, b)` is called to compute the sum of the input values `a` and `b`.


4. **Return Value**: The calculated `result` is returned by the `add_numbers` function.


Example:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
- Algorithm: `calculate_sum(5, 3)` is executed, which is assumed to return 8.
- Output: The function returns 8.

</algorithm>

<explanation>
**Imports**:
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within a subdirectory `utils` of a larger project directory structured under the `src` directory. This indicates that the code is part of a larger project with modules for utility functions, like `calculate_sum`.


**Function `add_numbers`**:
- **Purpose**: The `add_numbers` function serves as a simple wrapper around the `calculate_sum` function.  It takes two numerical inputs and returns their sum.
- **Arguments**:
    - `a`:  The first number to be added.
    - `b`: The second number to be added.
- **Return Value**: The `add_numbers` function returns the sum of `a` and `b` calculated by the `calculate_sum` function.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # result will be 8
```


**Variables**:
- `result`:  A variable of unknown type.  It stores the calculated sum.


**Relationship with Other Packages**:
- The code relies on the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module. This implies that the `calculator` module contains other functions related to mathematical calculations or potentially other utility functions.


**Potential Errors or Improvements**:
- **Error Handling**:  The code lacks error handling.  If `calculate_sum` encounters an error (e.g., inputs are not numbers), an exception could propagate and cause the program to crash.  Adding error handling (e.g., type checking for `a` and `b` or using a `try-except` block) would improve robustness.

- **Type Hinting**:  Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) would improve code readability and maintainability. This would help with static analysis and catching type-related errors during development.

- **Reusability**: If `calculate_sum` is intended to be used elsewhere in the project, the `add_numbers` function could be considered redundant. The `calculate_sum` function might be better used directly in those cases.



In summary, the code provides a basic function for adding two numbers using a helper function.  Improved error handling and type hinting would make the code more robust and maintainable.
