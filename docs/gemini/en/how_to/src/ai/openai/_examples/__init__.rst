How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block in `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py` defines a variable `MODE` and imports functions from `packaging.version` and `_examples.version`. It appears to be part of a larger project's initialization or configuration. The variable `MODE` likely represents a mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod') for the application. The imports are essential for handling versioning and potentially documentation. The presence of multiple docstrings suggests different parts of the code base, each with its documentation.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code initializes a variable named `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'.
2. The code imports functions from the `packaging.version` module and a module named `_examples.version`. These likely handle version information for the project (e.g., version checking, display).  The imports handle version checking and the definition of package versions.
3. Multiple docstrings are present. These docstrings provide documentation within the code.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No direct usage example possible without additional context.
    # This code block sets the configuration mode and imports versions.
    # To use it, you need to incorporate it within a larger application.
    # Further context is needed to provide appropriate usage.
