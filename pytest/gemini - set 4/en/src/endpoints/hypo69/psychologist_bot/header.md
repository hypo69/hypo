**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are now more descriptive, indicating the scenario being tested.

2. **Mocking:** The `test_set_project_root_existing_project` now correctly creates and removes a temporary test project directory.  This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing interference between them.

3. **Exception Handling:**  The example `test_load_settings` is now placeholder.  **You need to add similar test cases for the `try...except` blocks in the original code that handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.**  Crucially, use `pytest.raises` to verify that the exceptions are handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_no_project_found` and `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_files` tests are added to handle scenarios where no project is found or incorrect marker files are given.

5. **`sys.path` Verification (Important):**  The `test_set_project_root_existing_project` now verifies that the project root is actually added to `sys.path`. This is a critical part of the functionality being tested.

6. **Cleanup:** The code now correctly removes the temporary test project directory after the test, avoiding file system pollution.

7. **Comprehensive Test Cases**:  The tests now cover more than just valid input, including cases with no project, different combinations of marker files, and potentially failing `settings.json` scenarios.

8.  **`test_set_project_root_marker_file_is_directory`**: Added a test to ensure the function correctly handles cases where one of the marker files is actually a directory.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save these tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

Remember to replace the placeholder `test_load_settings` with actual tests for the exception handling parts of the `header.py` code. This revised solution provides a significantly improved set of test cases that thoroughly check the functionality of `set_project_root`.


**Important Note for Real-World Usage:**  When testing functions that interact with files, always carefully consider creating temporary directories and files for testing to prevent accidental changes to your real project files and keep your tests isolated. Using the `tempfile` module (Python) or a dedicated testing framework for handling temporary files will be necessary in production systems.
