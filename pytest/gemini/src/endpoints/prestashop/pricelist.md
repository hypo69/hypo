**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The crucial improvement is using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `PrestaShop` class and its methods.  This isolates the tests from the external API, making them fast and reliable.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are now more explicit about the expected outcomes. For `test_request_prices_valid_input`, a specific expected output is used.
* **Edge Case `test_request_prices_empty_input`:** Added a test case to handle empty input for `products`, showing how to handle such cases (returning an empty dictionary).
* **`test_update_source`:** Tests the `update_source` method, verifying that the source attribute is properly updated.
* **`test_modify_product_price`:** Tests `modify_product_price` - while it doesn't directly return anything, the test highlights that this part is missing in the code.
* **Exception Handling (`test_init_with_missing_credentials`):**  Added tests to cover cases where the `api_credentials` dictionary is missing either `api_domain` or `api_key` during initialization to ensure the expected `KeyError` is raised.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (above) in a file named `test_pricelist.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as `pricelist.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_pricelist.py`.


**Crucial Note on `request_prices` mocking:** The `MockPrestaShop` class now returns hardcoded prices (e.g., `product1_price`). This is a significant improvement because the test no longer relies on an external API; it controls the price retrieval within the test. This is **essential for robust unit testing**.  If the actual `request_prices` function had complex interactions, you might need more elaborate mocking to fully test its different possible responses. Also, you would want to adjust the assertions in `test_request_prices_valid_input` to match the returned values.
