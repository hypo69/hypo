```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`PROJECT_PATH`:** Added a constant to make the tests more robust and less brittle to path changes.  Replace `'hypotez'` with the correct path to your project directory if necessary.
* **Mocking `set_project_root`:** The original code relied on actual files.  The `mock_set_project_root` function now allows you to test different scenarios without creating or deleting files on your system. This is crucial for keeping tests isolated and repeatable.
* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:** Added tests for valid input (files exist), invalid input (files don't exist), empty `marker_files`, and a test to verify if the function properly inserts the project root into `sys.path` if it's not already there.  This is a critical test case.
* **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test names are more descriptive to clearly indicate the purpose of each test case.
* **Error Handling Tests:** The tests for settings and README loading now include appropriate exception handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).
* **Cleanup:** Added cleanup after each test case to remove the created temporary files.  This ensures the tests don't interfere with each other.
* **Import `json`:**  Added the `import json` statement as needed.

**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important Considerations:**

* **`settings.json` and `README.MD`:**  This revised test assumes you have a mock `settings.json` file in a `src` folder within the correct project folder in `PROJECT_PATH` for testing purposes. Adjust the path if your setup is different.   You'll also need a mock `README.MD` file as well.  This is important for testing the handling of missing files.  Remove the mock files after testing.
* **Actual File Structure:** Adapt `PROJECT_PATH` if your project structure is different.  These tests depend on the folder structure in your project.


This significantly improved solution now provides a much more robust and effective test suite. Remember to adjust the paths and file contents to match your actual project structure.
