**Changes Made**

- Added RST-style docstrings to all functions, methods, and variables.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` as required.
- Ensured correct handling of exceptions, using `logger.error` for logging and providing more specific error messages.
- Corrected the path construction for converting mp3 to wav in `text2speech` function.
- Fixed the return type of `text2speech` function to return a string representing the path, rather than a Path object. Added `str()` conversion for consistency.
- Improved variable names and code style to be more readable and maintainable.
- Corrected `wav_file_path` variable in `text2speech` function.
- Fixed exception handling by catching the specific exceptions and logging the details of the error in all cases.
