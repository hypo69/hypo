**Explanation and Improvements:**

- **Mocking:** The `mock_logger` fixture is crucial.  It allows us to test the `CrawleePython` class without needing a real PlaywrightCrawler or logger; this enhances isolation and makes tests deterministic. 
- **`tmp_path` fixture (important):** This fixture from `pytest` provides a temporary directory.  This is essential for `test_export_data`.  Without this, the test would fail because the created file would not be cleaned up and potentially interfere with subsequent tests.
- **Clearer Assertions:**  Instead of just checking for existence,  `test_export_data` now verifies if the file exists.
- **Exception Handling:**  `test_run_with_exception` simulates a crawler error and tests the exception handling within the `run` method.  This is crucial for robustness.
- **`test_run_invalid_urls`:** Added a test specifically to verify behavior with an empty `urls` list, which would likely result in a meaningful exception in the real application.
- **`@pytest.mark.asyncio`:** Added this decorator to `test_run` as recommended to explicitly indicate that the test should be run using asyncio.
- **Robustness:**  Tests are now more comprehensive, checking for expected types and behaviours with different input scenarios.
- **Descriptive Error Messages:** In the exception tests, the error messages now provide more context about what went wrong.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Replace `"src"` and `"crawlee"` with the actual paths in your project.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest`


This revised solution provides a more complete and robust set of tests for the `CrawleePython` class. Remember to adapt the file paths and imports to match your project structure. Remember to install the `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and other necessary packages. Remember to install the necessary libraries (like `playwright`) if they are not already installed for your project.
