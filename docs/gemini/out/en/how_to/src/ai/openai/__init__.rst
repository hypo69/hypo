How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file (`hypotez/src/ai/openai/__init__.py`) is an initialization module for the `openai` related functionality. It sets a variable `MODE` and imports necessary components.  It sets a mode variable, which is likely for different environments (like development or production), and imports functions from submodules, `translator` and `model`.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file sets the value of the `MODE` variable.  This is likely a configuration setting for the environment (e.g., 'dev', 'prod'). This variable will be used later in the codebase to control behavior that depends on the environment.

2. The code imports the `translate` function from the `.translator` submodule. This function is likely responsible for translation-related operations (likely language translation).

3. The code imports the `OpenAIModel` class from the `.model` submodule.  This class is presumably responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API (or an OpenAI compatible service).

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have the necessary setup for OpenAI API key and the modules installed)
    from hypotez.src.ai.openai import translate, OpenAIModel

    # Example using the translator:
    translated_text = translate("Hello, world!", target_language="es")
    print(translated_text)
    
    # Example using the OpenAIModel (requires initialization)
    openai_model = OpenAIModel()  # Initialize the model
    response = openai_model.generate_text("Summarize this paragraph...")
    print(response)
