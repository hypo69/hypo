# hypotez/src/ai/llama/model.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/ai/llama/model.py`, appears to be a configuration file or module for a system, likely related to a large language model (LLM) called Llama. It defines a global constant `MODE` which likely determines the operational mode (e.g., development, production).  The module contains several docstrings that lack specific details.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable that determines the operating mode of the system.  The current value is 'dev'.

**Value**:  `'dev'`


## Missing Information

This file primarily contains docstrings and variables, lacking substantial code that would require detailed documentation.  The purpose of the `MODE` variable and the context of the several multiline strings without function definitions are unclear and would need clarification from the original developers.


**Important Note**: The provided Python code has several docstrings that are not properly formatted or utilized within a function or class.  This makes it difficult to create meaningful documentation.  To generate accurate and detailed documentation, I would need more complete Python code.
