**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_add_numbers_positive`).

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover positive, zero, and negative inputs for both `add_numbers` and `subtract_numbers`.  Crucially, `test_divide_numbers_zero_denominator` now uses `pytest.raises` to explicitly check for the expected exception (`ZeroDivisionError`).

3. **Edge Cases:** Tests for valid and invalid inputs are included, along with cases involving zero and negative numbers.

4. **Exception Handling:** `test_divide_numbers_zero_denominator` correctly uses `pytest.raises` to verify that a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised when dividing by zero.  The `match` argument is helpful for more robust error checking.

5. **Fixture Removal (not needed here):**  Since no shared data was present in the original code, the example fixture is removed as it was not needed.

6. **Float Test:** An additional test (`test_divide_numbers_float`) verifies the function's handling of floating-point inputs.

This improved solution demonStartes best practices for writing `pytest` tests, including comprehensive coverage, clear test names, and robust exception handling. Remember to replace the example functions (`add_numbers`, `subtract_numbers`, `divide_numbers`) with the actual functions you want to test. Remember to run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_myfunctions.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_myfunctions.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.


**Important Note:** The placeholder code (`# The user-provided code goes here`) was empty.  The tests written here are based on the *example* functions provided. Replace those example functions with your actual code for meaningful tests.
