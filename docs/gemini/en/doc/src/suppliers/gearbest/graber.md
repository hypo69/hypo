# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/gearbest/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is a subclass of the `Grbr` class (likely from a parent module). It's designed to collect product data from the `gearbest.com` website.  The class overloads existing functions to handle specific data extraction logic for `gearbest.com` if necessary.  It allows for pre-processing steps using decorators, including custom `close_pop_up` logic (although a default decorator is not implemented here).


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class is responsible for gathering product information from the GearBest website. It extends the functionality of the parent `Graber` class to cater to GearBest's specific page structure.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance to interact with the web page.

#### `grab_page`

**Description**: Asynchronously gathers product fields from the page.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: A structured object containing the extracted product data.


## Functions

(Note: No functions outside of class methods are defined in this module.)


## Decorators

(Note: The module defines a decorator `close_pop_up`, but its implementation is commented out and therefore is not documented.)


## Variables

(Note: No top-level variables are defined beyond the `MODE` constant, though internal variables are used.  They are not included in the documentation unless specifically impacting external use.)
