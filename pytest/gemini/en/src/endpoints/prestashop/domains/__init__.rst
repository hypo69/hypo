```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are present in the provided code.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  If you provide the code
# that defines the functions and classes to test, I can generate
# appropriate test cases.
#
# Example of what to expect if you provide a function:
#
# Example of a function to test:
# def my_function(input_value):
#     if input_value > 0:
#         return input_value * 2
#     else:
#         raise ValueError("Input must be positive")


# Example Test Cases (using placeholder function)
#
# Replace my_function with the actual function from your code
# def test_my_function_valid_input():
#     assert my_function(5) == 10
#
# def test_my_function_zero_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
#         my_function(0)
#
# def test_my_function_negative_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
#         my_function(-5)
#
# #Example with a fixture
# @pytest.fixture
# def some_data():
#     return {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 123}

# def test_my_function_with_fixture(some_data):
#     assert my_function(some_data['key2']) == 246
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code is empty; it doesn't contain any functions or classes to test.  To create meaningful tests, you need to provide the Python code you want tested.

* **Provide the code:**  Paste the actual Python code from the file `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py` into the `input_code` section.
* **Identify testable units:**  Focus on functions, methods, and classes that represent independent units of functionality.  If the code is large, break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.
* **Edge cases and exceptions:** Think about input values that might produce unusual results or cause exceptions (e.g., empty lists, zero values, invalid data types). Use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.
* **Fixtures (if applicable):** If your functions need data or resources, create fixtures to provide them in a consistent way across your tests.


**How to use this template:**

1. Replace the placeholder comments with your actual code.
2. Modify the example test cases to test the specific functions and classes within your code.
3. Run the tests using `pytest`: `pytest`


By providing the actual code, you'll get more specific and useful test cases that cover the logic and ensure the correctness of your code. Remember to replace the examples with tests that precisely target your functions and data.
