**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_project_structure` Fixture:**  This fixture now creates a complete test project structure within a temporary directory using `tmp_path`. This isolates the tests and prevents them from affecting the actual project.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, like `test_set_project_root_valid_input`.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including:
   - A valid project structure.
   - No marker files present.
   - Marker files located in a subdirectory.
   - Marker files not found (which should return the current directory).
   - cases where the root directory is already in sys.path
   - cases where the marker files are in parent directories

4. **`pytest.raises` is not needed:** The `set_project_root` function does not raise exceptions in the typical cases where a file is not found (or if invalid data is found in settings.json), it just returns the current directory. Therefore `pytest.raises` is not needed, as the important aspect is that the correct path is returned.

5. **Using `tmp_path`:** The tests now correctly use `tmp_path` to create temporary directories for testing, ensuring isolation.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and complete test suite for the `set_project_root` function, covering various scenarios and edge cases. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`.  You would then run the tests using `pytest`.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
pytest
```
