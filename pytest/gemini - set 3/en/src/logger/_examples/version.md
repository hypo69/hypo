**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names clearly indicate the purpose of each test, making the tests more readable and maintainable.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover the `__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__author__` attributes, ensuring thorough validation of the module-level variables.

3. **Edge Case Handling (and absence thereof):**  The `test_no_undefined_variables` handles potential issues with undefined variables gracefully by checking for their existence using `hasattr()`. This is a crucial aspect of testing, and the absence of such functionality in the prior tests made them weak.

4. **Type Validation:** The `test_version_type` and `test_details_type` functions verify that the `__version__` and `__details__` attributes are indeed strings, ensuring the correct data type.

5. **Docstrings in Tests:** All test functions include docstrings explaining their purpose, enhancing the documentation and readability.

6. **Import:** Explicit import of the target module (`hypotez.src.logger._examples.version`).  This is critical for actual running of the tests.

7. **Robustness:** The tests are written to be more robust by handling possible issues in the code gracefully, making them less sensitive to potential changes.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`

This revised solution addresses potential issues and provides a more comprehensive and reliable set of tests for the provided Python code. It leverages `pytest` effectively and incorporates best practices for writing comprehensive test cases. Remember to adjust the file paths if necessary, according to your project structure. Remember to include the `hypotez` directory in your python path if the codebase is not in your current working directory.
