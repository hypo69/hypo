**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Fixture Usage:** The fixtures (`valid_url`, `invalid_url`, etc.) are now used more directly in the tests, making the intent clearer.

2. **Realistic Invalid Input:** The `test_graber_invalid_url` now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the correct exception type (likely `ValueError` or a custom exception from the `Graber` class).  Critically, the code now correctly shows *how* to simulate an invalid URL response using `monkeypatch`. This is critical for testing cases beyond the just the function arguments and also how your code handles HTTP errors.

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The `test_graber_invalid_response` and `test_graber_empty_response` tests are much more robust now. They show how to use `monkeypatch` to mock the `requests` library and test the `Graber` class's error handling when it receives an invalid or empty response from the web server.  These are absolutely essential test cases to check how `Graber` handles possible problems.

4. **Mocking:**  Using `monkeypatch` to mock `requests.get` is *essential* for testing the logic within the `Graber` class without relying on an external web server.  This significantly improves the test's reliability and speed.

5. **Specific Error Messages:** The tests now check for specific error messages to verify that the correct exceptions are being raised with the right details under various conditions. This is important for debugging and providing useful failure reports.

**How to Use This Example:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  Update the fixtures with actual valid and invalid data for `Graber`, including URL strings, expected response types, etc.
* **Replace Assertions:**  Modify the assertions (`assert graber.get_data() is not None`) to reflect the data returned by your `Graber.get_data()` method, and replace placeholders with appropriate checks.
* **Add More Tests:**  Add more tests for other methods in the `Graber` class, covering edge cases (like timeouts, rate limits, and different HTTP status codes), and any custom exceptions.


This revised answer provides a much more practical and robust example of how to write comprehensive `pytest` tests for a web-scraping function, including crucial error handling and mocking techniques. Remember to adapt these tests to your specific `Graber` class and the data it's expected to handle. Remember to adapt these tests to your specific `Graber` class and the data it's expected to handle. Remember to install the `requests` library (`pip install requests`) if you haven't already.
