```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for testing:** The solution now utilizes `pytest.fixture` to create temporary dummy files and mock the `gs.path` object. This isolates the tests and avoids potential side effects.


2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various scenarios, including:
   - Valid input (files in the same directory, parent directory).
   - Missing marker files.
   - Empty marker files.
   - Invalid marker file type.
   - `FileNotFoundError` handling for `settings.json`.
   - `json.JSONDecodeError` handling for invalid JSON in `settings.json`.

3. **Error Handling:** Includes `pytest.raises` for testing exception handling.


4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more specific and descriptive, making the tests easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Mocking `gs.path`:**  Crucially, the `mock_gs_path` fixture now correctly mocks the `gs.path` object, allowing us to test the scenarios where the file isn't found or the JSON is invalid.


6. **Correct File Path Handling:** Addresses the critical issue of resolving the file path correctly. `tmp_path` from `pytest` is now used to create temporary directories in a controlled way, ensuring correct file paths. This is essential for robust testing.

7. **Import fix**: The `import hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.header as header` line now correctly imports the module in the testing functions.

This improved solution provides a more thorough and reliable set of tests for the `set_project_root` function, covering both valid and invalid scenarios, including crucial edge cases and error conditions.  Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, and any other necessary modules in the `requirements.txt` if you have one. If not, install them in your Python environment.


To run these tests, save them in a file named (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/header.py` and run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal. Remember to adjust the imports if your project structure is different.
