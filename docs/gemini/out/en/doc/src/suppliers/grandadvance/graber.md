# hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is responsible for collecting product data from the `grandadvanse.co.il` website.  It extends the `Graber` base class and provides specific functions to handle data extraction from the target website, handling potential exception cases.  This class also utilizes asynchronous operations (`asyncio`) for efficient data gathering. It contains a decorator (`close_pop_up`) for closing pop-up windows that might appear on the website before other operations.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class extends the `Grbr` class (likely a base class for grabbers) to specifically handle data collection from the `grandadvanse.co.il` website.

**Methods**

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` instance with a webdriver instance (`driver`) and sets the `supplier_prefix`.  It also initializes global configuration for the locator used by the `close_pop_up` decorator to handle popups.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The webdriver instance used for interacting with the web page.


#### `grab_page`

**Description**: Asynchronous function that collects product fields.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The webdriver instance to use for grabbing the data.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: A `ProductFields` object containing the gathered product information.


## Functions

(Note: No functions are defined outside the class, so this section is empty)


## Exceptions

(No exceptions are explicitly defined in the code.)


## Notes

- The code includes numerous commented-out functions that are likely placeholders for handling specific product details. These functions would need to be implemented to fully utilize the `Graber` class.
- The `close_pop_up` decorator is commented out.  To utilize it, uncomment the relevant lines in the `Graber` class and implement its behavior.
