## Module Documentation


**Description**: This module appears to be a placeholder or initial setup for a Dialogflow integration within the larger `hypotez` project. It currently only defines a constant `MODE` with a value of 'dev'.


**Note:** The docstrings within the Python code provide incomplete or placeholder descriptions.  A more comprehensive and useful documentation would require filling in details about the purpose and operation of this module, including the role of the `MODE` constant and any other important aspects of the Dialogflow integration.  The reference to "HERE SHOULD BE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULE OPERATION !" indicates the need to add significant detail for a functional explanation.
