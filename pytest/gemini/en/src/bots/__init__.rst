**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  The necessary import statement is included.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive (e.g., `test_telegram_bot_initialization`, `test_telegram_bot_send_message_invalid_chat_id`).

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  The `test_telegram_bot_send_message_invalid_chat_id` and `test_telegram_bot_send_message_no_message` tests demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions and inspect the error message.  This is crucial for robust testing.

4. **Example Tests (Crucial):**  The provided code only imports a class (`TelegramBot`), but doesn't define any methods.  The example tests are based on a *hypothetical* `send_message` method.  You MUST replace this with actual methods from your `TelegramBot` class and write tests that actually use your class methods.


5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The `test_telegram_bot_send_message_invalid_chat_id`  tests  are added to cover a case of an invalid chat ID.

6. **Missing Message:** The `test_telegram_bot_send_message_no_message` test checks that `send_message` correctly handles a missing argument or an invalid type.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Update the `chat_id`, `message`, and other variables with the specific values expected by your `TelegramBot` methods.

2. **Add tests for other methods:** If your `TelegramBot` class has other methods, create test functions for them, and add more test cases to ensure various input scenarios and potential exceptions are tested.

3. **Run the tests:** Use `pytest` to run the test file.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

* **Complete `TelegramBot` implementation:**  You need to fill in the actual class implementation (`TelegramBot`) with its methods.
* **Modify the tests:**  Adapt the tests to use the actual parameters and methods of the completed class.
* **Mock the External Dependencies:**  If `TelegramBot` interacts with an external API (like the Telegram API), use a mock or a stub for the external interaction to avoid actual API calls in the test environment.  This will ensure that your tests are fast, independent of external services, and not prone to external failures.
