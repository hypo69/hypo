```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. **Import `calculate_sum`:** The code starts by importing the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module. This allows the `add_numbers` function to utilize the functionality provided by the calculator module.

   *Example:* Imagine `src.utils.calculator` contains a function like this:

   ```python
   def calculate_sum(a, b):
       return a + b
   ```

2. **Define `add_numbers`:** A function named `add_numbers` is defined, which accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`.

   *Example:* Calling `add_numbers(3, 5)` would pass the values 3 and 5 to the function.

3. **Call `calculate_sum`:** Inside the `add_numbers` function, `calculate_sum(a, b)` is called to compute the sum of the input values `a` and `b`. The result of this calculation is stored in the variable `result`.

   *Example:* If `a = 3` and `b = 5`, `calculate_sum(3, 5)` would return `8`, which would be assigned to `result`.

4. **Return `result`:** Finally, the function returns the calculated `result`.

   *Example:* The `add_numbers(3, 5)` call would return the value `8`.

<explanation>
**Imports:**

- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `utils` package, which is part of the `src` directory structure. This suggests that the `hypotez` project has a modular design for code organization and reusability.  The `utils` package probably contains other utility functions.

**Function `add_numbers`:**

- **Purpose:** The `add_numbers` function provides a simple interface to add two numbers. It encapsulates the operation of addition, promoting modularity and code reuse.  It's a higher-level function that abstracts away the details of the calculation.

- **Arguments:**
    - `a`: The first number to be added.
    - `b`: The second number to be added.

- **Return Value:** The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

- **Example Usage:**
```python
result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # result will be 8
```

**Classes (implicit):**

- There are no explicitly defined classes in the provided code.  Any classes involved in the `calculate_sum` functionality would be defined within the `src.utils.calculator` module.


**Variables:**

- `result`: This variable holds the sum of `a` and `b`. Its type depends on the type of values returned from `calculate_sum`.  Presumably, the type is an integer or a float.


**Relationship with Other Packages:**

- The `add_numbers` function depends on the `calculate_sum` function within the `src.utils.calculator` module. This dependency demonStartes a clear separation of concerns.  The `add_numbers` function is a client of the `calculate_sum` function, meaning that it relies on the calculator for the addition operation.

**Possible Improvements:**

- **Error Handling:**  The code does not handle potential errors, such as `a` or `b` being non-numeric values. Adding error handling (e.g., using `try...except` blocks) would make the code more robust.

- **Type Hinting:**  Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int`) would improve code readability and maintainability by explicitly declaring the expected types.

- **Docstrings:**  Adding docstrings to functions would help to document the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and any important considerations.
