**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `example_project_root` and `example_settings_json` fixtures to create temporary test directories and files for isolated tests.  Crucially, `mock_sys_path` is now used to avoid unintended side effects on the global `sys.path` in subsequent tests.  This is critical for ensuring test isolation and prevents unexpected errors.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and reflect the specific scenarios being tested.

* **Comprehensive Cases:** Includes tests for valid input, when marker files are not present, missing marker files, when the project root is already in `sys.path`, and when the script file itself doesn't exist.

* **Edge Cases:** The test now includes testing cases where the marker files are not present.

* **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test exception handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings loading. The example test for `FileNotFoundError` now creates the needed folder but doesn't create the file.

* **File Existence:** Added checks to ensure that necessary files and directories exist in the test cases.

* **`sys.path` Handling:** The `mock_sys_path` fixture correctly restores `sys.path` after each test, avoiding side effects between tests.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Create a temporary project structure (`test_project`) in the same directory containing `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git` directory as in the example.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This improved test suite is more robust, isolated, and effectively covers different scenarios for testing `set_project_root` and the settings loading logic. Remember to adapt the paths (`./test_project/src`) if your actual project structure is different.
