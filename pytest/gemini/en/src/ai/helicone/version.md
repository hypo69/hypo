```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`mock_settings_file` fixture:**  This fixture now correctly creates a temporary `settings.json` file within the test directory.  Crucially, it uses `tmpdir` to ensure proper cleanup and isolation.

2. **`mock_root_dir` Fixture:** Introduced a fixture for `__root__`.  This is critical because the original code relies on `__root__`.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific condition being tested.

4. **Robust Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **Correct File Handling:** Uses `Pathlib.Path` to handle the path.

6. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests for both valid and missing `settings.json` files.  An important addition is handling malformed `settings.json` (e.g., invalid JSON).


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code in a file named `test_version.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `version.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Application**

* **`__root__` Variable:** The use of `__root__` is problematic.  It's unclear how this variable is set.  In a real-world project, you should have a more reliable method of determining the project root.  Consider using a more robust approach to project root determination like `Path(__file__).parent.parent`, making sure to account for your actual project directory structure.


By addressing these issues, you greatly improve the reliability and usefulness of your test suite. Remember that in real-world projects, handling edge cases, including corrupted input data and missing files, is crucial for the stability and robustness of your code.
