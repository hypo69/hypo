```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.ai.myai.traffic_light as traffic_light

# No input code was provided, so no tests can be written.
# If you provide the code for the traffic_light.py file, I can generate appropriate tests.

# Example tests assuming a function exists (replace with your function's name):
# def test_traffic_light_valid_state():
#     """Tests if the traffic light changes to green."""
#     assert traffic_light.change_light_state('red') == 'green'
#
# def test_traffic_light_invalid_state():
#     """Tests if the traffic light throws an error for an invalid state."""
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
#         traffic_light.change_light_state('purple')
#
# def test_traffic_light_edge_case_current_state():
#     """Tests if the traffic light handles edge cases related to the current state."""
#     assert traffic_light.change_light_state('green') == 'yellow'  #or whatever the expected state change is
#
# def test_traffic_light_no_state_passed():
#     """Tests the function with no state passed."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         traffic_light.change_light_state()

# Example with a fixture (assuming a function takes data)
# @pytest.fixture
# def traffic_light_data():
#     return {"light_state": "red"}
#
# def test_traffic_light_function_with_fixture(traffic_light_data):
#     # Access the data using the fixture
#     result = traffic_light.some_function(traffic_light_data['light_state'])
#     assert result == "expected output"

# IMPORTANT: Replace the placeholders like "change_light_state", "some_function"
#  with the actual function names and parameters from your traffic_light.py file.
#  Also, replace the example assertions with the appropriate assertions based
#  on the expected behavior of your functions.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Input Code:** The provided `input_code` is empty, making it impossible to create meaningful tests.  This example shows *placeholder* tests.  You *must* provide the actual `traffic_light.py` code for me to generate accurate and relevant tests.

2. **Example Test Cases:** The examples demonStarte how to test different scenarios (valid input, invalid input, edge cases, exceptions) using `pytest.raises`.  Adapt these examples to match the functions and classes in your `traffic_light.py` file.

3. **Error Handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to test if your code raises exceptions when it should.  Ensure your `traffic_light.py` code is robust in handling various input errors.

4. **Fixtures (if needed):** The example demonStartes how to define and use fixtures to provide data to the test functions.  Use fixtures for any data that you need to pass to your tests consistently.

5. **Clear and Descriptive Test Names:**  The names of the test functions are crucial for understanding the purpose of each test. Use clear and precise names to indicate what's being tested.

6. **Correct Assertions:** Replace the placeholder assertions (`assert result == "expected output"`) with the correct assertions based on your function's intended behavior.

7. **Import:** The code now imports the `traffic_light` module correctly.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_traffic_light.py`) in the same directory as your `traffic_light.py` file.
2. Run `pytest` from your terminal in that directory.  pytest will automatically find and execute the test functions in the `test_traffic_light.py` file.

**Crucial Next Step:** Provide the `traffic_light.py` code for accurate and helpful test generation.
