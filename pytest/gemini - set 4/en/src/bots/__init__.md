**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly describe the purpose of each test (e.g., `test_telegram_bot_invalid_token`).

2. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test for `ValueError` exceptions when the token or chat_id is invalid, providing more specific error checking.  Crucially, these tests check for the *exact* error messages, which is better than just checking for the exception type.

3. **Missing Attributes/Methods Test:** Added a test (`test_telegram_bot_missing_methods`) to ensure that essential methods (like `send_message`, which would need to be defined) are present in the class, preventing cryptic errors later.  This is crucial for ensuring the class is complete as intended.

4. **Data Validation:** The tests now cover the validation of input parameters (`token`, `chat_id`), explicitly checking for empty strings and raising the correct errors.

5. **Mode Check:**  The `test_telegram_bot_initialization` test verifies that the `mode` attribute correctly inherits the value from the global `MODE` variable.

6. **Example Usage (Mocking):** Added a commented-out example of how to test `send_message` using mocking. This is *highly* recommended in a real-world scenario, as it avoids depending on external services for testing purposes.  The `mocker` context from `pytest` is used for mocking the `send_message` function call within the `TelegramBot`.

**Important Considerations (for full testing):**

* **`send_message` Implementation:**  The example mocking test needs to be implemented in conjunction with a definition of the `TelegramBot.send_message` method (and `telegram` module imports) in the `hypotez/src/bots/__init__.py`. Without that implementation, the mocking example will not work correctly.


* **External Dependencies:** If `TelegramBot` interacts with external services (like a Telegram API), you'll need to mock those interactions using `pytest-mock` for proper isolation during testing.  This is absolutely necessary to prevent flakiness due to network issues, rate limits, or other external factors.

* **Edge Cases:** If there are more specific edge cases related to the `TelegramBot` (e.g., unusual chat_id formats, malformed tokens), you should add test cases to cover them.

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive and reliable testing of the `TelegramBot` class. Remember to uncomment and adapt the example mocking test to fit the actual `TelegramBot` implementation. Remember to replace the placeholder `send_message` with your actual method definition.
