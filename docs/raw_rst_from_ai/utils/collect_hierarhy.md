**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during file copying (e.g., permission issues, file not found) . This prevents the entire script from crashing.  Critically, it prints an informative error message, crucial for debugging.  Also, checks if the `src_directory` exists before proceeding, preventing a `FileNotFoundError`.

* **Directory Existence Check:**  Crucially, verifies that `src_directory` exists.  This protects against unexpected errors if the source directory is missing.

* **Directory Creation:** Uses `project_structure_directory.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` to ensure that the `project_structure` directory and all necessary parent directories are created. This is robust and avoids errors if the directory already exists.

* **Empty Directory Handling**: Added `item.name.strip()` to the directory exclusion logic. This prevents empty strings (which might result from a directory name containing only whitespace) from being processed incorrectly.

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Changed `j_dumps` to `j_dumps` for better readability.


These improvements make the code significantly more robust and easier to debug, especially in real-world scenarios with potentially problematic file systems.  The error handling and validation steps are vital. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`jjson`) if you haven't already. Remember to replace `header` with the correct module if it's a different file.
