How to use the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` module

This module, `header.py`, sets the project root directory and loads project settings and documentation.  It's crucial for properly importing other modules within the `hypotez` project.

**Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root()`:** This function dynamically finds the root directory of the project. It searches up the directory tree from the current file (`__file__`) until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). This allows the code to function correctly regardless of where in the project hierarchy the script is run from.  Importantly, it then adds the root directory to `sys.path` so Python can import modules located within the project.

2. **Project Settings:** The script loads settings from a JSON file (`settings.json`) located in the `src` directory of the project root.  It handles potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` during file loading.

3. **Project Documentation:** The script attempts to load project documentation from a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory. It handles potential `FileNotFoundError` errors.

4. **Variables:** It defines various project metadata variables (`__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.) based on the loaded settings.  These variables are readily available for use in other parts of the project.  Crucially, it defaults to sensible values in case the relevant files are not found or are improperly formatted.

**How to Use:**

1. **Place `header.py` in the `src/logger` directory:** Ensure the file is correctly placed within your project's `hypotez/src/logger` directory.

2. **Run a script from within the project:** The `set_project_root()` function works by identifying the project root relative to the location of the *calling* script.  Place code that needs access to project information in other files within the same project, rather than relying on importing this file directly.

3. **Import the necessary functions:** Import functions from within this module where needed, e.g.:
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.logger import set_project_root
   ```

4. **Use project metadata:** Access the project information stored in the variables (like `__project_name__`, `__root__`).


**Example Usage (in another Python file):**

```python
import os
from hypotez.src.logger import set_project_root, __root__, __project_name__

# ... Your code ...

project_root = __root__
project_name = __project_name__

print(f"Project Root: {project_root}")
print(f"Project Name: {project_name}")
```

**Error Handling:**

The `try...except` blocks are crucial for robustness. They prevent the entire script from crashing if `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing or invalid.  The `...` in the `except` blocks indicates that you should handle the error appropriately in your own codeâ€”for example, by logging the error or using default values.

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path.root`:** This assumes you have a `gs` module (likely your own) that provides a way to access the project root directory. You'll need to create or adjust the `gs` module to match your project's structure.

* **`marker_files`:** The `set_project_root` function is designed to be flexible. You can alter the `marker_files` tuple to suit the specific directory structure of your project.

* **`settings.json` structure:** Ensure that the `settings.json` file is properly formatted and contains the keys specified in the code (e.g., `project_name`, `version`).
