```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`TestClient`:**  Crucially uses `TestClient` for making API requests, avoiding external processes.
* **`script_path` Fixture:**  A fixture is now used to access the `script.py` path, making the tests more maintainable.
* **Error Handling:** Tests explicitly check for HTTP 400 and 500 errors, validating the API's error handling.  Importantly, the test for a script error now simulates a failure, testing the API's response to that condition. The error response message is checked instead of the script's output.  This is essential because you want to test the API, not necessarily the success of the external script.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Uses more descriptive assertions (e.g., checking for specific error messages).
* **Mocking/Dummy Script:**  The `test_process_data_script_error` test *does not* rely on an external `script.py`  (which would be unreliable and difficult to test). It simulates a script error that the API receives. This is better practice.
* **Static File Test:** The test for static files now includes an essential check:  it makes sure the file exists before running the test. 
* **`asyncio`:** Removed `asyncio.run`. TestClient handles asynchronous requests already.


**Before Running Tests:**

1.  **Create `script.py`:** A dummy `script.py` file is necessary for the tests to run.  Include a minimal example that returns `Hello from script.py`.  Or simulate an error-producing script in the test itself.

2.  **Create `html` folder:** Create an `html` folder in the `hypotez/src/fast_api/` directory.  Place a dummy `index.html` in it.  (The tests now assume this exists.)



```python
# Example script.py
import sys
def main():
    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    print(f"Hello from script.py: {line}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()

```

Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest fastapi
```

Now, you can run the tests with `pytest`. The tests should now provide much more comprehensive coverage of the FastAPI code.
