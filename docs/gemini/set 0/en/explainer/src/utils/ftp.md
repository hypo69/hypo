.. module: src.utils 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

## <algorithm>

**File Transfer Algorithm (write/read/delete):**

1. **Connection Establishment:** Establish a connection to the FTP server using the provided credentials.
2. **Directory Change (if needed):** Change the current working directory on the FTP server to the desired destination directory.
3. **File Operation:** Perform the requested operation (send, receive, delete) on the specified file.
    * **Write:** Open the local file in binary read mode (`rb`), and send it to the FTP server using `session.storbinary()`.
    * **Read:** Open a local file in binary write mode (`wb`), receive the file from the FTP server using `session.retrbinary()`, and write its content to the local file.  Then read the content from the local file.
    * **Delete:** Delete the specified file from the FTP server using `session.delete()`.
4. **Error Handling:** Use `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during each step and log appropriate error messages using the `logger` module.
5. **Session Closing:** Close the FTP session using `session.quit()`.  Include `try...except` blocks in the `finally` clause for robust error handling.

**Example Data Flow:**

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
| Local File      | --> | FTP Server      |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  file.txt       |     | dest_dir/file.txt|
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
      write()                   ^
                               |
                               V
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  file.txt       | <-- | FTP Server      |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
      read()                   ^
                               |
                               V
+-----------------+
|   Empty         |

      delete()

**Dependencies Analysis:**

*   `src.logger`: Imported from `src.logger`â€”likely part of a logging framework in the project, indicating this module interacts with logging for error handling.

*   `typing`: Provides type hints for function parameters and return values, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

*   `ftplib`:  Imports the FTP library, enabling interaction with FTP servers.  Critically important for the functionality of the module.

*   `pathlib`: Allows working with file paths in an OS-independent way, making the code more portable.


## <explanation>

**Imports:**

*   `src.logger`: Used for logging errors during FTP operations.  This implies a structured logging system within the project (`src`).  The `logger` object is likely a wrapper around a logging framework.

*   `typing.Union`: Provides a type hint allowing functions to return multiple types, such as strings or bytes in the `read` function. This module is a standard Python module.

*   `ftplib`: The key import allowing the code to interact with the FTP protocol.

*   `pathlib.Path`:  This import might seem redundant with `str` usage in `source_file_path`.


**Classes:**

The code doesn't define any classes. It consists entirely of functions.


**Functions:**

*   `write(source_file_path, dest_dir, dest_file_name)`: Sends a file to the FTP server.
    *   **Arguments:** `source_file_path` (local path), `dest_dir` (remote directory), `dest_file_name` (remote filename).
    *   **Return Value:** `bool` (True for success, False for failure).
    *   **Example Usage:** `write('local/file.txt', '/remote/dir', 'file.txt')`

*   `read(source_file_path, dest_dir, dest_file_name)`: Retrieves a file from the FTP server.
    *   **Arguments:** Similar to `write`, with `source_file_path` being where the downloaded file will be saved locally.
    *   **Return Value:** `Union[str, bytes, None]` (file content or `None` for failure).
    *   **Example Usage:** `read('local/file2.txt', '/remote/dir', 'file2.txt')`

*   `delete(source_file_path, dest_dir, dest_file_name)`: Deletes a file from the FTP server.
    *   **Arguments:** Similar to `write`.  Note that `source_file_path` is not used in the implementation.
    *   **Return Value:** `bool` (True for success, False for failure).
    *   **Example Usage:** `delete('local/file3.txt', '/remote/dir', 'file3.txt')`


**Variables:**

*   `_connection`: A dictionary defining the FTP server connection details.  This is hardcoded and should be configurable.

*   `MODE`: A variable set to 'dev'.  Its purpose isn't immediately obvious from the code and needs context for its specific use in the overall project.


**Potential Errors and Improvements:**

*   **Hardcoded credentials:** The server, username, and password are hardcoded in `_connection`.  This is a serious security risk.  These values should be loaded from a configuration file or environment variables.

*   **Error Handling Improvements:** While error handling is present, consider adding more specific exception handling to differentiate between network issues, file system errors, and FTP-specific errors.

*   **`source_file_path` redundancy in `delete`:** The `source_file_path` argument in the `delete` function isn't used.  Remove it to improve consistency.

* **Missing validation:**  Input validation (e.g., checking for empty strings, valid paths) should be added to prevent unexpected behavior.


**Relationship to Other Project Parts:**

The `src.logger` import suggests a connection to a logging system for the project.  The `MODE` variable hints at a possible deployment mode for configuration.  This file appears to be a utility for interacting with FTP servers, likely used by other parts of the project requiring this capability.  Careful consideration of how this file is used within the larger application context, is essential for further improvements.
