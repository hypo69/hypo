from src.google import SpreadSheet

ss = SpreadSheet(spreadsheet_name = '030724_men_summer_fashion')

# Add your code here to interact with the spreadsheet.
# Examples:

# To get the values of the first sheet:
try:
    values = ss.get_sheet_values()
    if values:
        print("Values of the first sheet:")
        for row in values:
            print(row)
    else:
        print("No data found in the sheet.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error getting sheet values: {e}")

# To get values from a specific sheet:
try:
    sheet_name = "Sheet1"  # Replace with the actual sheet name
    values = ss.get_sheet_values(sheet_name)
    if values:
        print(f"\nValues from sheet '{sheet_name}':")
        for row in values:
            print(row)
    else:
        print(f"No data found in sheet '{sheet_name}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error getting sheet values: {e}")


# To write values to a sheet (example):
try:
  sheet_name = "Sheet1"  # Replace with the actual sheet name
  new_values = [
      ["New Header 1", "New Header 2"],
      ["Value 1", "Value 2"],
      ["Value 3", "Value 4"]
  ]
  ss.update_sheet_values(sheet_name, new_values)
  print(f"Values updated to sheet '{sheet_name}'.")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error updating sheet values: {e}")



# Importantly, add error handling!  The `try...except` blocks are crucial.
# Google Sheets API calls can fail for various reasons (network issues,
# authentication problems, invalid data).  You need to catch these errors
# to prevent your script from crashing.


# Remember to install the necessary libraries:
# pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

# Also, make sure you have set up proper authentication for your Google Sheet
# access in your `src.google.import SpreadSheet` part.


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during interactions with the Google Sheets API. This is absolutely essential for robust code.  The `print(f"Error getting sheet values: {e}")` line allows you to diagnose issues easily.

2. **Example Usage:** Added example code to retrieve values from the first sheet and a specific sheet, print them, and to update a sheet.


3. **Clear Output:** Improved the output to be more informative and readable.


4. **Important Considerations:**
   - **Authentication:** The `SpreadSheet` class, which is likely a custom class you've written, needs to handle authentication properly.  It should utilize the Google API client library to authenticate and access the Google Sheets API.  The code example includes a *very important* note about authentication.
   - **Sheet Name:** Make sure `sheet_name` is set correctly to the name of the sheet you want to work with.
   - **Library Installation:** The code includes a reminder about installing necessary libraries.
   - **Data Validation:**  You might want to add validation checks on the data you're getting or sending to the spreadsheet to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.


**How to Use:**

1. **Authentication:**  Configure your `SpreadSheet` class to handle authentication with the Google API.
2. **Run:** Execute the Python script.  It will attempt to get the values from the specified sheet.
3. **Inspect Output:** Look at the console output to see if the data retrieval was successful and if any error messages were displayed.


This improved code is much more robust and practical for interacting with Google Sheets data. Remember to replace placeholders (like the sheet name) with the actual values for your spreadsheet.  **Crucially, the authentication part of your `SpreadSheet` class is the missing piece to make this work.**
