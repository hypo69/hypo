```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  Therefore, no tests can be written.
# HTML files are for presentation, not executable logic.

# Example of a test that would be written if there were Python code to test:
# def test_my_function_with_valid_input(example_data):
#     """Checks the behavior of my_function with valid input."""
#     result = my_function(example_data)
#     assert result == expected_result  # Replace with actual assertion


# This is a placeholder; replace with actual test functions if applicable.
# Example of how a fixture would be used:
# @pytest.fixture
# def example_data():
#     return {"input": "valid data"}


# Example of an exception test:
# def test_my_function_with_invalid_input():
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         my_function("invalid data") # Replace with function call


# Placeholder for further test cases:
# def test_function_with_edge_case():
#     pass  # Add assertions to test for the edge case.
#
# def test_function_with_large_input():
#     pass  # Add assertions to test with very large input data
