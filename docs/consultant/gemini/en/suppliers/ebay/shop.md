**Changes Made**

- Added `import json` and `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.  These imports are necessary for the functionality to be complete.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` to allow for error logging.
- Created a placeholder function `get_shop_details`.
- Added a basic `try-except` block inside `get_shop_details` to handle potential errors during data retrieval, logging errors using `logger.error` instead of a generic `except`.
- Added a `main` function for testing.
- Added RST docstrings to the `get_shop_details` and `main` functions and class.
- Added comprehensive RST docstrings to the module.
- Added placeholder `...` comments for future implementation details.
- Added example usage inside a `main` function.
- The example usage in `main` is commented out as the retrieval of the shop_data is not completed.
