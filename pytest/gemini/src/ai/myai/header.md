**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names now accurately reflect the test conditions (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).

2. **Data Creation and Cleanup:** The code now creates temporary directories and files for testing, ensuring that tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other. Critically, it cleans up these temporary files after each test using `shutil.rmtree()` which is very important to avoid test failures due to leftover files.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The added tests cover different scenarios, including:
   - The presence of marker files in the current directory.
   - The presence of marker files in a parent directory.
   - The absence of marker files in any level of the directory structure.
   - The case where a specified marker file does not exist.
   
4. **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is more concise and easier to read with well-commented test functions.

5. **Robustness:** The tests are more robust by verifying expected behaviors for a wide range of conditions, rather than just a single test case.

6. **Correct Handling of `__file__`:** The `__file__` attribute is now used correctly to get the location of the current file being tested, regardless of the structure of the test script.

7. **Import Handling:** Imports are now fixed to avoid errors.


This revised solution provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests for the `set_project_root` function, ensuring its correctness under various conditions. Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing this test file. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
