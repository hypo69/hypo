**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mock Functions:**  Crucially, the code now uses mock functions (`get_api_key`, `make_api_call`) instead of interacting with a file or actual API. This is essential for testability. Replace these mocks with actual implementations when integrating with the PrestaShop API. The mocks now return `None` for invalid cases, allowing the tests to confirm that API calls fail correctly.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover cases of valid and invalid website URLs, as well as valid and missing API keys. This covers more scenarios.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive and explain the purpose of each test.
* **`pytest.raises`:** The example `test_make_api_call_invalid_input` uses `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions.  Adapt this pattern as needed for your specific error handling.
* **Edge Cases:** Tests are added to cover scenarios where the API might return no data (e.g., empty list of products).
* **`cache_clear`:**  The `test_make_api_call_missing_api_key` example now demonStartes how to clear any cached API results to ensure each test is isolated. This prevents spurious results due to cache usage.  *Important: Adapt this technique to the way your `get_api_key` function is used.*


**Important:**

1. **Replace Mock Implementations:** Replace the mock functions (`get_api_key`, `make_api_call`) with your actual code for interacting with the `credentials.kdbx` file and the PrestaShop API.
2. **Error Handling:** The provided code assumes the API returns something in case of valid parameters. You will want to adapt error handling to match the exact behavior of your API.  If the API returns a specific error code/message, then test those specific responses.
3. **Security:**  In a real application, NEVER hardcode API keys directly into your tests.  This mock code is a placeholder and should be adapted to load keys from a test-specific credentials file.


By making these changes, the tests are more robust and provide a much better framework for testing your PrestaShop integration. Remember to adapt the error handling, test scenarios, and mocking to your specific API requirements. Remember that the PrestaShop API likely returns specific error codes and messages. Your tests should handle and test for these.
