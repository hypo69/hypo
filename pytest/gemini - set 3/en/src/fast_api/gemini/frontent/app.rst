```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mock `fetch`:** The original code used `fetch`, which is asynchronous.  The `mock_fetch` function now simulates a successful API response or a 404/500 error.  This is *essential* for unit testing asynchronous code.

2. **Mock React State (`setInput`, `setMessages`):**  Crucially, `setInput` and `setMessages` are mocked (`mock_state_update`).  This lets you verify the *internal* state changes without relying on the actual React state management.

3. **Asynchronous Tests:** The tests are now asynchronous using `async def` and `await`. This is necessary to correctly handle the asynchronous operations in the original JavaScript code.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `test_send_message_api_error` demonStartes how to test for errors returned from the API.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more focused on checking the expected state changes after the `sendMessage` call.

6. **Import Fix:** Added `from js_code import App` to correctly import the code you want to test. Make sure you replace `js_code` with your actual file name!


**How to Run:**

You need to have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, put the test code in a Python file (e.g., `test_app.py`) and your JavaScript code in a separate file, perhaps `js_code.py` (as per the import fix instruction).

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest test_app.py
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Complex State:** If the React component's state is more complex (e.g., involving multiple state updates), you might need more elaborate mocking or even utilizing a testing library like `unittest` to simulate React state updates in a more comprehensive way.
* **File Structure:**  The test code needs to know where to import `App`. Make sure you have the correct file structure.


This improved solution addresses the critical asynchronous nature of the JavaScript code and provides more robust and reliable tests. Remember to adapt the `mock_fetch` function to match the expected API response and error handling. Also, replace `js_code` with the correct filename if it's different.
