try:
    with open('../settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    print("Warning: settings.json not found or invalid. Using default values.")


__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''
__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''  # Fixed typo
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Changes and explanations:**

* **`__copyright__`:** Corrected the typo `__cofrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now prints a warning message if `settings.json` is not found or contains invalid JSON. This is crucial for debugging and informing the user about potential issues.  The default values are still used, preventing a crash.
* **Variable Type:** Made `__version__` a string directly. The previous code had `: str`, which is unnecessary and a potential source of confusion in Python.  Python will automatically infer the correct type in most cases.
* **PEP 8 Style (Minor):** Python's style guide (PEP 8) recommends using `=` for assignments in variable declarations like this.  I've updated accordingly.


**How to use the `version.py` module:**

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..'))) # Necessary adjustment to properly import from your project

from category import version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
# ... access other attributes like __author__, etc.
```

**Important considerations (and best practices):**

* **`settings.json` structure:** Ensure that your `settings.json` file contains the keys `project_name`, `version`, `author`, `copyright`, and `cofee` (or whatever keys you need).  Example:

```json
{
  "project_name": "MyCoolProject",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2023, John Doe",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/support"
}
```

* **`venv/Scripts/python.exe`:** This line in the shebang is correct to call the Python executable from your virtual environment.


By including the error handling and PEP 8 compliance, the code is more robust and user-friendly. Remember to place the `settings.json` file in the parent directory of `version.py` (in `..`).  Correctly adding the path using `sys.path.append` is also crucial for importing from different parts of the project.
