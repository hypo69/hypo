# Important:  Remember to remove the dummy files after testing!
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Dummy Class:** I've added a placeholder `CodeAssistant` class with a `process_files` method.  **Crucially, replace this with your actual code.**

2.  **Test Cases:**
    *   `test_process_files_valid_input`: Tests with valid input, including assertions to check the expected output.
    *   `test_process_files_invalid_input`: Tests for the `TypeError` raised with invalid input.
    *   `test_process_files_file_not_found`: Tests for the `FileNotFoundError` with a non-existent file.  This is a critical edge case.
    *   `test_process_files_empty_input`: Tests for empty input list and checks for appropriate error handling
    *   The use of `pytest.raises` is demonStarted to correctly catch and test exceptions.

3.  **File Handling:** The `process_files` example now uses `try...except` to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions, which is essential in real-world code.

4. **Clear Assertions:**  The tests now use `assert` statements to verify the expected outputs, making the tests more effective.

5. **Dummy Files:** The test now creates dummy test files to facilitate testing, and crucially it removes these files after testing via a `with` statement.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above (with your actual code in place of the dummy) in a Python file (e.g., `test_code_assistant.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_code_assistant.py`


Remember to adapt the tests to reflect the behavior of your actual code and ensure complete test coverage. Remember to remove or comment out the dummy files after testing. This enhanced answer provides a much more robust and realistic example of `pytest` tests.
