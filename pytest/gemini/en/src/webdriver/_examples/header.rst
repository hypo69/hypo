**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Imports `dir_root` and `dir_src` directly from the provided code to avoid ambiguity and ensure the tests are correctly interacting with the targeted functions.

2. **Robust `test_dir_root_calculation`:**  Instead of just verifying the type, it now verifies that the directory exists, making the test more robust.

3. **`test_dir_root_hypotez_not_found`:** This new test is crucial. It checks for the case where the `hypotez` directory doesn't exist, demonstrating exception handling.

4. **`test_sys_path_append_dir_root`:** This test checks that the code successfully adds the directory to the Python path (`sys.path`) by making a call to a path that should exist if the path is properly appended. It also verifies that the append was successful, by comparing the path length after the append.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more descriptive, making the test failures more informative.

6. **Error Handling (`try...except`)**: The crucial `test_dir_root_hypotez_not_found` is improved by using a `try...except` block to catch the expected `ValueError` (or any other potential error) and check if the error message includes "hypotez".

7. **File Existence Verification:** The `test_sys_path_append_dir_root` test checks for the existence of a file to verify if the path was successfully appended.

8. **`test_dir_src_creation`:** This test verifies the `dir_src` variable is correctly initialized as a Path object, and it exists.

9. **Test for relative paths:** The `test_relative_paths` test verifies if relative paths within the project are created correctly as `Path` objects.


**Before running the tests:**

- Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
-  Create a directory structure that resembles what your actual project would look like (this is crucial for the test to be meaningful).


This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage and is less prone to errors, especially for situations with different directory structures or errors in path resolution within the original code. Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with the actual name of your project directory if needed. Remember to install the `pathlib` library if it's not already installed.


```bash
pip install pytest pathlib
