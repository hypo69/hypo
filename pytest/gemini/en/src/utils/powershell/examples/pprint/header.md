**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `test_root_path_invalid_directory` now uses `pytest.raises` to verify that a `ModuleNotFoundError` or similar exception is raised when the `hypotez` directory is not found. This is crucial for robustness.

2. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more explicit about what's being checked, making the tests easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Data Setup and Cleanup:** The `test_root_path_valid_directory` now creates a dummy `hypotez` directory and removes it afterward to avoid conflicts with other tests or lingering files.

4. **Robustness:** The code now clears the `sys.path` before each test to ensure the tests are isolated and don't interfere with each other.

5. **More comprehensive test:** The tests now covers the potential `AttributeError` in addition to the `ModuleNotFoundError` scenario to ensure the code is robust.

6. **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to explain the purpose of each test function and the specific scenarios tested.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  **Install pytest:** If you don't have pytest installed, run:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  **Run the tests:** Navigate to the directory containing `test_header.py` in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

This revised solution provides more thorough and reliable testing of the `header.py` code, handling various potential scenarios and providing more informative error messages when failures occur. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/utils/powershell/examples/pprint"` with the actual path to the directory containing your code if it differs.  A crucial step is to ensure that the correct path to the code is reflected in the code you are testing.
