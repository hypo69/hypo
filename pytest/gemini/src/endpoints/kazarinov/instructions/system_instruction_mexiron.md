```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added `TypeError` exceptions to validate the input data structure, preventing unexpected behavior if the input isn't in the expected format.  This is crucial for robustness.


2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test names are more descriptive and accurately reflect the test's purpose.


3. **Comprehensive Tests:** Added tests for empty input and incorrect data types to cover a wider range of scenarios.


4. **Structure:** The test cases follow the example structure provided in the prompt, making them easier to read and understand.


5. **Placeholder:**  The `process_computer_build` function now includes placeholder comments for the translation and build type logic.  **Crucially**,  these comments are essential to emphasize that the actual implementation will involve external libraries or APIs for translation and component analysis.

**How to use and extend these tests:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  The placeholder translation and build type analysis logic in `process_computer_build` needs to be implemented using appropriate translation APIs or libraries.
* **More Test Cases:**  Consider adding test cases for edge cases in the translated data, potential errors from translation APIs, or different types of components.
* **Integration with Translation API:**  If you integrate with a translation API, test its functionality separately and include those tests in your suite.
* **More Complex Build Types:** Implement more elaborate component analysis to determine different build types (gaming, workstation, etc.) and add more tests to cover these different categories.



Remember to install the `pytest` library: `pip install pytest` before running the tests.  Then run `pytest` from your terminal in the same directory as the test file.
