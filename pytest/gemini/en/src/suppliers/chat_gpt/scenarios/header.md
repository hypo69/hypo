**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `example_project_root` and `example_settings_file` fixtures to create a temporary project directory and settings file, respectively. This allows for cleaner and more controlled testing without affecting the actual project structure.
* **Mocking `gs.path`:** Introduced `mock_gs_path` to mock the `gs.path` object used in the original code, isolating the `set_project_root` function from external dependencies.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** Included tests covering various scenarios, including valid project roots, missing project roots, missing marker files, and cases where the marker file is present but is not a directory.  These tests now handle the case where `settings` is `None` and `doc_str` is `None`.
* **Error handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to ensure the code handles missing or malformed JSON files gracefully.
* **Clearer comments:** Added more descriptive comments explaining the logic and purpose of each test case.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Removed unnecessary `pytest.raises` as the tests now correctly verify the exceptions using the assertions.
* **Isolation:** The tests are now fully isolated, avoiding any side effects from one test to another.
* **File cleanup:** The `example_project_root` now properly cleans up the temporary directory after the tests are run.


This revised solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for the `set_project_root` function and `settings` loading, adhering to the requirements specified in the prompt. Remember to install the necessary packages (`pytest`, `packaging`).  You'll also need to adjust the import statements if the `gs` module is in a different location. Remember to replace `hypotez.src` with the actual path if it's different in your project structure.
