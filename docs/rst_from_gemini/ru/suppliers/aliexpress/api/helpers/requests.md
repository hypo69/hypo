    """
    Makes an API request and handles potential errors.

    Args:
        request: The request object containing the API request details.
        response_name: The key within the response object where the result is located.
        attempts: The number of attempts to make the request.  Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        The parsed API response data if successful, or None if errors occur.
        Note: Returns None instead of raising exceptions to allow the calling function to handle the error.  This is crucial for robust error handling.

    Raises:
        Exception:  If unexpected errors occur during the request process.
        Note:  We have removed the previous `ApiRequestException` and `ApiRequestResponseException` in favor of returning `None`.  This approach provides more flexibility in handling errors in the calling function.

**Improvements:**

* **Clearer Docstrings:** The docstring now explains the function's purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions in a more comprehensive way.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The code now includes more specific error checks and handles potential `KeyError`, `json.JSONDecodeError` and other exceptions. This prevents unexpected crashes.  Crucially, it returns `None` if anything goes wrong, avoiding the implicit `raise`. This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior in the calling code.
* **Descriptive Logging:** The logging messages are more informative, including error details and messages that clarify where the error occurred.
* **Retry Mechanism (Improved):** The `attempts` parameter and the `for` loop now properly implement retry logic.
* **Explicit Return `None` on Failure:**  This is the key change.  The function explicitly returns `None` in all cases of failure.  This allows the calling function to deal with errors gracefully.
* **`get()` method:** Using `.get('resp_result')` is safer and avoids a `KeyError` if the key isn't present.
* **Exception Handling:** Catches `KeyError` and `JSONDecodeError` more specifically for better error messages.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Renamed some variables for better readability.


**How to Use:**

```python
try:
    result = api_request(my_request_object, 'my_response_key')
    if result:
        # Process the successful response
        print(result)
    else:
        print("API request failed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This revised code is much more robust and reliable in dealing with API issues, and crucially, allows the calling code to handle errors gracefully.  Using `None` as a failure indicator is a standard and more adaptable pattern than raising exceptions. Remember to install the `requests` library if you haven't already.
