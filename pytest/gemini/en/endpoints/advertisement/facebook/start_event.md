**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `FacebookPromoter` objects.  This isolates the test from the actual Facebook interaction, making it much faster and more reliable.  The `@patch` decorator is correctly used to patch the `logger` module.

2. **Clearer Error Handling:** The `test_run_events_with_exception` test is significantly improved. It uses `patch.object` to mock the `run_events` method directly, simulating an exception in the method itself.  It asserts that the *correct* exception is raised.

3. **Empty Input Test:** `test_run_events_empty_input` now correctly tests the case where input lists are empty, raising the expected `ValueError`.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** The `test_invalid_group_file_paths` example now demonstrates how to test for `FileNotFoundError` by leveraging `pytest.raises`.

5. **`mock_driver` Fixture:** A `mock_driver` fixture is introduced to manage the creation and mocking of the `Driver` object.

6. **`mock_facebook_promoter` Fixture:**  A fixture for the `FacebookPromoter` is added.

7. **`test_logger_debug_called`:** This example test checks if the expected `logger.debug` call actually happens within the `run_events` loop.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_start_event.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_start_event.py`.

**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

*   **Complex Interactions:** For more involved interactions (e.g., accessing external resources), mock these dependencies deeply to isolate your test code.
*   **Database Interactions:** If your code interacts with a database, use a database fixture to create and manage a temporary test database.
*   **External Services:** For interactions with external services (like Facebook's API), mock these services, because directly interacting in a test environment would likely be very slow or impossible.

This revised example provides a more comprehensive and robust testing approach compared to the previous one, and it's suitable for integration into a larger testing suite. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with specific assertions related to the actual logic within `FacebookPromoter`. Remember to adapt the test to the specific logic and interactions in your production code.
