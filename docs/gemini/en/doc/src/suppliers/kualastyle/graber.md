# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for extracting product data from the `kualastyle.co.il` website.  It inherits from the `Graber` base class and provides specialized functions for handling the specific structure and data extraction needs of the target website.  It utilizes a decorator (`@close_pop_up`) to handle pop-up windows (if needed) and uses a `Context` class to manage global settings. The class handles fetching various product fields.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class encapsulates the logic for extracting product data from `kualastyle.co.il`. It extends the base `Graber` class to implement specific data extraction methods tailored to the website's structure.

**Methods**

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for interacting with the web page.

#### `grab_page`

**Description**:  Retrieves and processes all product data from the given web page.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for page interaction.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: A populated `ProductFields` object containing the extracted product data.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`:  If there's an error during execution of locating elements. (Exceptions from any async calls inside this function will be propagated).


## Functions

### `close_pop_up`

**Description**: Creates a decorator to handle closing pop-up windows before executing the main function.  This function is currently commented out, meaning the decorator isn't used.  It would be used if special handling of pop-up windows is needed.

**Parameters**:
- `value` (Any, optional): Additional value for the decorator. Defaults to `None`.

**Returns**:
- `Callable`: A decorator that wraps the function to be executed.


## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: String variable holding the execution mode (e.g., 'dev' for development).


## Notes

- The code includes numerous commented-out await calls to various data extraction functions (`id_product`, `additional_shipping_cost`, etc.).  These functions are likely implemented elsewhere but not currently used within `grab_page`.
- The `Context` class is defined but commented out in the source code.
- The `Context` class (if used) would typically handle managing the WebDriver (`driver`) and potential locator objects (`locator`).
- The use of `SimpleNamespace` is consistent with a Pydantic-based structure but is only used in the comments to `Context.locator`.
- The `ProductFields` class isn't defined in the provided code snippet; it's assumed to exist elsewhere to represent the structure of the extracted product data.
