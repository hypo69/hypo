```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Comments:** The template now correctly includes placeholders (`# Replace with your function call and assertions`) for you to insert the actual function calls and assertions. This is *critical* because the provided code was just a list of modules, not a Python function definition.  You must **replace** these comments with the actual Python code you want to test.

2. **Example Fixture:**  I've included a basic example fixture (`example_data`) that returns a dictionary. Replace this with any fixtures you need for your tests.

3. **Example Test Cases:**  The example test cases are now more concrete, demonstrating the correct structure for testing functions and including the `assert` statement to verify expected outcomes. Importantly, the example shows how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling, a crucial aspect of testing robust code.

4. **Import Statements:**  Crucially, to run these tests, you must import the functions from the module you want to test.  This is reflected in the placeholder comments.


**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Copy the Python code from your `hypotez/src` files (the actual functions, classes, or methods) into the placeholders labeled `# Replace with your function call and assertions` within the example tests.
2. **Define Fixtures:** Add your fixtures (e.g., database connections, file paths, etc.) if needed, following the example structure.
3. **Add Assertions:**  Within the tests, replace the placeholder `assert True` with assertions that check the actual results returned by your functions against the expected results.
4. **Run Tests:** Save the file (e.g., `test_hypotez.py`) and run `pytest test_hypotez.py` in your terminal.


**Important Note:** The given input code only describes modules and their locations. You *must* provide the actual Python code to generate meaningful and effective test cases. This improved response now provides a usable template for you to fill in with your code. Remember to follow the requirements, especially regarding clear and descriptive test names and isolated tests. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
