**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `service_account` function and `open_by_key` method. This is crucial for testing functions that interact with external resources (like Google Sheets).  The `mock_service_account` fixture now correctly provides a mock client for gspread.


* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_by_title_existing_spreadsheet`).


* **Edge Case for `get_by_title`:** Added a test `test_get_by_title_non_existing_spreadsheet` to check if the function creates a spreadsheet when it doesn't exist.


* **Exception Handling:** Added a test (`test_get_by_id_invalid_id`) to demonStarte how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.


* **Fixture for `GSpreadsheet` Instance:**  Creates a `spreadsheet_instance` fixture to avoid creating a new `GSpreadsheet` object for each test. This is a significant improvement in test structure and efficiency.



* **Realistic Mock for `openall`:**  Mocks `openall` to return a list of spreadsheets, simulating a scenario where spreadsheets might exist.


* **`assert isinstance(result, dict)`:**  Verifies that the result is actually a dictionary.


* **Comments:** Added comments explaining the purpose of each test case.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest gspread google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```

2.  Replace the placeholder for `global_settingspread` with the actual path if it's not in the same directory.

3.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_gspreadsheet.py`).

4.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_gspreadsheet.py
    ```


This revised solution provides more robust and comprehensive tests for the `GSpreadsheet` class, addressing potential errors and edge cases. Remember to adapt the mocks to match the actual behavior of the `service_account` function and your specific Google Sheets API interactions if needed. Remember to adjust the mock return values to match the expected responses from the Google Sheets API.
