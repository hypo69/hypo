```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import `playwrid`:** Imports the class directly to avoid any issues with relative paths.
* **Fixtures for Settings:** Creates `example_settings` and `example_settings_custom` fixtures to load example settings. This makes the tests more readable and reusable.
* **Clearer Test Cases:**  Test names are more descriptive, indicating the type of input or scenario being tested.
* **Exception Handling (Crucial):** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError` to ensure the code handles errors gracefully when the settings file is missing or has a bad format.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to catch exceptions.
* **Example Usage:**  Added `test_playwrid_start_valid_url` and `test_playwrid_start_invalid_url` tests to check the functionality.  The invalid URL test now uses `pytest.raises` correctly to assert the expected exception.
* **Mocking `logger` (important):**  The `test_playwrid_start_invalid_url`  now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the logger. This is crucial, as otherwise the tests might fail due to interactions with the real logging system.  The logger is now properly mocked to prevent actual output to the console during the test.



**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_playwrid.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_playwrid.py`

This improved solution is more robust and comprehensive, covering various scenarios and potential issues in the `Playwrid` class. Remember to replace `gs.path.src` with the actual path to your `src` directory if it's different. Also, adjust the dummy JSON path for the 'custom_settings.json' file to your project structure.  If you're using a real logging configuration, adjust the test to match the expected logging behavior.
