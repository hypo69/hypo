**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more explicitly describe the scenario.
2. **Temporary Directory Creation:** Crucial for isolated tests. Temporary directories are created, filled with the necessary files, and then removed after the tests to prevent pollution.
3. **Edge Case `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`:** Now handles the case where no marker files are present in the directory tree, returning the correct path (current directory).
4. **`test_set_project_root_marker_in_parent_dir`:** Added a test to check if the function correctly finds the root when the marker file is in a parent directory.
5. **`test_set_project_root_marker_files_not_found`:** Handles the case where *no* marker file is found in the directory or its parents.
6. **`test_set_project_root_empty_marker_files`:** Added a test for an empty `marker_files` tuple, to ensure the function doesn't break.
7. **Error Handling:** (Placeholder): The original code had `try...except` blocks, but there are no tests demonStarting the handling of exception cases.  Add tests to ensure the correct behavior of those except blocks.
8. **File Existence Checks (crucial!):** Added checks (`(temp_dir / "pyproject.toml").touch()`). These ensures that files are present for the tests to work correctly.
9. **Import `shutil`:** This line is needed for `shutil.rmtree` to remove the temporary directory.

**Next Steps (Missing parts for complete testing):**

- **Error Handling Tests:** Add tests to verify that the `try...except` blocks in the original code function as expected by providing incorrect file contents or non-existent files. For example, a test where `settings.json` is corrupt or missing.


Remember to replace placeholders (like the missing `settings.json` test) with actual test cases that validate the expected behavior when those specific files are present, missing, or have invalid data.  Add tests for `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.  This comprehensive set of test cases will thoroughly validate the project root finding logic and error handling.
