## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/__init__.py`, serves as an entry point for advertisement-related endpoints within the Hypotez application.  It likely facilitates the use of various advertisement platforms, with Facebook being the initial example.

**Key Concepts:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:**  This global variable likely controls the operational mode of the application (e.g., development, staging, production).  Modify this value to change the application's behavior.
* **Import Statement (`from .facebook import Facebook`):** This line imports the `Facebook` class (or similar) from the `facebook.py` file within the `advertisement` subdirectory. This allows you to use Facebook-specific advertisement features.


**How to use:**

1. **Ensure the required dependencies are installed:**  The code assumes that the Facebook advertisement API (or whatever API is used) is installed and configured. Check the necessary installation instructions for the specific API library in use.

2. **Access the `Facebook` class:**

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement import Facebook

   # Initialize the Facebook object (assuming a constructor exists).  This would likely require authentication and configuration details.
   facebook_instance = Facebook(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")

   # Example usage (replace with the actual method call)
   ad_data = facebook_instance.get_ad_performance()

   print(ad_data)
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The provided example lacks error handling. Include `try...except` blocks to gracefully manage potential exceptions during API interactions (e.g., network issues, authentication failures, invalid API calls).
* **Configuration:** The initialization of the `Facebook` object likely requires configuration parameters (API keys, access tokens, etc.).  These should be managed securely (e.g., environment variables or configuration files) to prevent hardcoding sensitive information into the code.
* **Documentation:** The `Facebook` class (and potentially other classes imported in `facebook.py`) should have well-documented methods and attributes to facilitate understanding and use.
* **`facebook.py`:**  The `facebook.py` file likely contains the implementation details for interacting with the Facebook API, including specific functions for fetching ad data, creating ads, etc.


**Further Development:**

To expand the functionality of this module, you can:

* Add support for other advertisement platforms (e.g., Google Ads, Twitter Ads).
* Implement more sophisticated advertisement management features.
* Add logging for debugging and tracking API interactions.
* Create functions to handle ad creation, bidding, optimization, etc.


By following these guidelines, you can effectively use the `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/__init__.py` file to interact with advertisement APIs and manage your advertisement campaigns within the application. Remember to consult the documentation for the specific libraries and APIs you are using for accurate implementation details.
