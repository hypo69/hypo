```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
""" module: src.ai.openai """


import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Find the root directory of the project
__root__ = Path(os.getcwd()).resolve().parent.parent
# Ensure the root directory exists
if __root__.exists():
    sys.path.append(str(__root__))
else:
    print(f"Error: Root directory '{__root__}' does not exist.")
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code

# Alternatively, if you want to handle cases where 'hypotez' is not present:
# try:
#     __root__ = Path(os.getcwd()).resolve().parent.parent
#     if __root__.exists() and ('hypotez' in str(__root__)):  # Check if 'hypotez' is part of the path
#         sys.path.append(str(__root__))
#     else:
#         print(f"Error: Root directory '{__root__}' is invalid or missing 'hypotez'.")
#         sys.exit(1)
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
#     sys.exit(1)


```

**Explanation of Improvements and Key Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial improvement is the addition of error handling.  The original code assumed the directory structure `hypotez` exists in the current working directory, which is unreliable. The updated code checks if `__root__` exists *before* trying to append it to `sys.path`.  If it doesn't exist, it prints an error message and exits the script using `sys.exit(1)`.  This prevents crashes and provides a more robust solution.

* **`Pathlib` for Robustness:** Using `Pathlib` is more Pythonic and safer than string manipulation for path handling, as it handles platform-specific path separators automatically.

* **`os.getcwd().resolve()`**: The code now uses `os.getcwd().resolve()`. This ensures that the current working directory is resolved to an absolute path and correctly reflects the actual directory you're in.  The `.parent.parent` part correctly resolves to the grandparent directory. This is critical for robustness in different operating systems and working environments.

* **Alternative Approach (with "hypotez"):** The commented-out `try...except` block shows an alternative approach to ensure that the directory structure you are looking for actually exists *and* contains `hypotez`.  This is sometimes useful, but the basic check with `if __root__.exists()` should be sufficient if your directory structure is predictable.


* **Explicit error codes**: The code now returns an exit code of 1 if there's an error, which is a standard way to signal errors to the calling environment.

**How to use it:**

1.  Save this code as `header.py` in the `openai` directory within your project structure.  (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Documents\repos\hypotez\src\ai\openai\header.py`)

2.  In any Python file within your `hypotez` project (e.g., a file in `src` or a file in `hypotez/scripts`), import `header.py`.   This will automatically modify `sys.path` to include the project root, allowing you to import modules from any part of the project.

```python
# Example usage (in another Python file):
import header
import my_module  # Assuming my_module is in a subdirectory of hypotez
# ... Use my_module ...
```

This revised solution is significantly more robust and reliable for projects where you need to manage your project structure in a dynamic or complex way. Remember to adapt the path finding to your specific project structure if it differs.
