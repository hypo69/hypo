## Introduction

The `bail` package provides a simple way to throw an error in your Node.js, Deno, or browser code.  It's particularly useful when you want to centralize error handling, avoiding repetitive `if (error) throw error` checks throughout your code.

## Installation

**Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+):**

```bash
npm install bail
```

**Deno:**

```typescript
import { bail } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/bail@2?dts';
```

**Browsers:**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { bail } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/bail@2?min';
</script>
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { bail } from 'bail';

// No error provided, so nothing happens.
bail();

// Throw the error.
try {
  bail(new Error('Something went wrong!'));
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // Output: Something went wrong!
}
```
