"""
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server.

** Usage Notes **:
- Requires a 'logger' module (presumably for logging errors) - imported as `from src.logger import logger`.
- Assumes the FTP connection details (_connection) are defined elsewhere.  Modify _connection directly or use environment variables for better security and maintainability.

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations. (Not used)
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths. (Not used directly)

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Added `try...except` blocks to catch specific exceptions (like `FileNotFoundError`, `ftplib.error_perm`, etc.). This makes the code much more robust. Critically, it prevents silently failing if the file is not found.
* **Explicit `FileNotFoundError` Handling:**  Handles the case where the source file doesn't exist.
* **Clearer Error Logging:**  Improved the error messages logged to the logger to provide more context about the error.
* **Removed Unnecessary `pathlib` Import:** Since the code doesn't use `pathlib` for file path manipulation, this import is removed.
* **Absolute Paths:** Modified the code to expect `dest_dir` as an absolute path. This is crucial for reliability on the server-side.
* **Security:**  Emphasized the need to avoid hardcoding credentials.
* **Docstring Improvements:** Docstrings are enhanced to better explain how the functions should be used and what kinds of errors might be encountered.  Added `Raises` sections to the docstrings.
* **Return Values:** Modified return types to be more specific (e.g., returning `None` instead of `bytes` when a file read fails).

**How to Use (Example with error handling):**

```python
try:
    success = ftp.write('C:/path/to/my/file.txt', '/remote/directory', 'new_file_name.txt')
    if success:
        print("File sent successfully!")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


```

This revised solution is much more robust, secure, and easier to maintain.  Remember to replace placeholder values in `_connection` with your actual FTP details. Remember to install `ftplib`: `pip install ftplib`
