How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value 'dev' to it.  It also contains several multiline string comments, but these comments do not appear to affect the functionality of the code.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block sets a global variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'.
2. The code block includes several multiline docstrings which serve as documentation and are not executed directly.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example of accessing the MODE variable
    from hypotez.src.ai.llama.model import MODE
    print(MODE)
