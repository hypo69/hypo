ABOUT THE EDITOR 


David Ahi has a BEE from Cornell University, MBA from Carnegie- 
Melion University and has done further work in educational psychology at 
the University of Pittsburgh. 

Two years in the Army Security Agency were followed by four years with 
Management Science Associates working on computer models and 
analysis of new consumer products. He continued work in computer 
analysis (of vocational education graduates) with Educational Systems 
Research Institute. 

He joined Digital Equipment Corporation in early 1970. As Education 
Product Line Manager he formulated the concept of an educational 
computer system consisting of hardware, software, and courseware (Edu- 
System) and helped guide DEC into a leading position in the education 
market. 

Mr. Ahi joined AT&T in 1974 as Education Marketing Manager and was 
later promoted to Manager of Marketing Communications where he was re- 
sponsible for the development of sales promotional strategies and 
materials for the Bell System. Concurrent with this move, he started 
Creative Computing as a hobby in late 1974. 

As Creative Computing grew, Mr. Ahi left AT&T in 1978 to devote full 
time to it. Creative Computing magazine today is number 1 in software and 
applications for small computers and a leader in publishing books, cassette 
and disk software, and related materials. 

Mr. Ahi is the author of 6 books and over 70 articles on the use of 
computers. He is a frequent lecturer and workshop leader at colleges and 
professional conferences. He is amember of ACM, AEDS, AERA, COSMEP 
and NCTM. 


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 


So many people had a hand in bringing this book to fruition, it’s difficult 
to know where to start with acknowledgements. Clearly the 70 some odd 
game authors deserve a great deal of credit. Taking each game in its own 
peculiar dialect of Basic and converting it to a “standard” Microsoft Basic 
was a huge task ably managed by Steve North. Thanks to the team of pro- 
grammers involved in the conversion effort: Steven Neitz, Bruce Schaeffer, 
and Jeff Yuan. 


RESTRICTIONS 


The programs in this book belong to Creative Computing. They are not in 
the public domain. Much as we like to be nice guys, we can not allow these 
programs to be distributed by non-profit user’s groups, or sold in machine- 
readable format by other parties. You can do whatever you want with the 
games, but only for your own personal use. 

Some games are available on tape cassette and floppy disk for various 
computers from Creative Computing Software. If they are not available from 
your dealer, send a large self-addressed stamped envelope for a catalog to

Introduction 


For most of my adult life I've pursued what some 
might consider a hopelessly disorganized diversity of 
projects. I’ve developed books, records, games and toys 
— and an occasional script or song — for the Children’s 
Television Workshop (producers of Sesame Street and 
The Electric Company), and, on the side, I’ve written and 
edited satiric pieces for the National Lampoon and other 
publications. People often ask me if | think it’s 
“sensible” to spread myself over so many media. “My 
activities really are all related,” | answer, somewhat 
defensively. “At least somewhat...” 

The truth is that it’s the very variety of my work that’s 
kept me interested and challenged. And, not coinci- 
dentally, I’m convinced that it’s the unlikely mixture of 
media and people — of humor with curriculum content, 
of children’s games with rock’n’roll music, of animation 
with phonics lessons; of child psychologists with 
puppeteers — that has made Sesame Street so vital, so 
exciting, and so successful. 

One world that aiways did seem irrelevant to my 
pursuits, however, was computing. Oh sure, computers 
might store information, or generate lists of words 
recognizable to five-year-olds, or index research 
results, or handle accounts, or, of course, invade my 
privacy. In short, they might be a useful tool for 
someone else (probably someone pretty different from 
me). But computers as a creative medium—much less a 
medium | could actually feel comfortable with? Never! 

Then, one day a few summers back, my wife, 
Genevieve—then an engineering student at Columbia— 
showed me a book called Basic Computer Games, by 
David Ah!. To my amazement, it had funny pictures in it. 
it was full of games — many of them delightfully silly. 
And — wonder of wonders! — at least some of it 
(sample runs of the games, for example) was not hope- 
lessly beyond my comprehension. 

| was intrigued, and when, months later, | visited the 
Boston Children’s Museum and actually got to play with 
acomputer, | was hooked. The terminals at the museum 
played many of the games in David Ahl’s book. What’s 
more, they actually called me by name, and made 
humorous comments about my playing skill. After 
several hours of trying to land a capsule on the moon 
(only to be told that I’d created several hundred new 
craters, and that Neil Armstrong “did It right the first 
time”), | had to be dragged away from the keyboard — it 
was past closing time, the museum personnel insisted. 

From that day on, the development of computer 
games — to entertain and to educate — has been a high 
priority activity for us at CTW. (As | write this, we're de- 
signing a prototype computer game center to open, near 
Philadelphia, in 1980 — a project In which David Ahi has 
taken a pioneering role). For the computer combines the 
possibility of fun, education, challenge, personaliza- 
tlon, humor and — most important — interaction, ina 
way that no other medium can. Computers are infinitely 
patient, not minding (unless they’re programmed to 
mind) if you take all day to respond to a question or 
move a game “piece”. If there’s something you don’t 
understand, you don’t have to be embarrassed to ask a 





Vill 


computer for help. A computer can adjust the difficulty 
level of a game or activity to suit your ability — some 
programs even learn how to beat you as you continue to 
play against them. Armed with the proper software, a 
computer can play a song (or allow you to play one), 
paint a picture, write a poem or tell a story. Or it can 
plunge you into a whole new world, so you can learn by 
doing (or just escape, for a few moments, into a delight- 
fui fantasy). 

The games in this, David Ahl’s second collection, 
demonstrate many of these attributes. Try Camel, for 
example, in which you’re left alone in the Gobi Desert 
with one quart of water and a bunch of Wild Berbers hot 
on your trail. (You'll learn something about resource 
management even if you don’t escape to use your new 
knowledge.) Or type Concentration into the computer, 
and let your children perfect their matching and memory 
skills without showing you up. Become a starship 
captain and practice navigating a three-dimensional 
universe, in Maneuvers. Turn on Father so your kids can 
argue with the computer — instead of you — if they 
want to stay out late on Saturday night. Or — the ulti- 
mate trip — play Millionaire and start your whole life 
over again (complete with such decisions as what job to 
apply for, what investments to make, and what to do 
when an airplane crashes into your magnificent new 
home)! 

The main point of ali this Is that whatever else 
computers are meant to be, they can be turned into 
magical multi-media machines that put you squarely in 
the center of the action. And, as Dave Ahi has continu- 
ally demonstrated, they’re an awful lot of fun. Turn the 
page and see.

Conversions to Other BASICs and Debugging Hints 


All the programs in this book have been converted and 
tested in Microsoft BASIC. We have not used any extended 
or machine-dependent features, so they will work in 
almost any machine with Microsoft BASIC (TRS-80 Level 
1, Commodore PET, Apple II with Applesoft BASIC, OS! 
Challenger, Exidy Sorcerer, or CP/M disk operating 
system). However, we ran the programs on a Teletype 
KSR-43 terminal, so several of the games are designed to 
run with a 72 character terminal width, and two of the 
games (PATTERNS and PINBALL) use the backspace 
function to print overstrikes. Both of these programs can 
be modified, if need be, to bypass the use of this function. 
However, if your computer has a screen then you may have 
to adapt the programs to a narrower terminal width 
(especially on the PET which is only 40 characters wide). 
Of course, you can also use your screen display for special 
animated graphics if you're clever. 


If It Doesn't Work 


Although your first reaction may be to curse your 
computer and start yelling, “There should be a law against 
people who sell books full of programs that don't work!” 
we have found that a/most all errors are simply typing 
mistakes, or not knowing about some peculiarity of your 
particular machine. So if a program doesn't work, we 
strongly suggest checking your program line-by-line 
against the one in this book. If you keep getting some kind 
of very obvious error which is plainly not in our program 
RUN, please bear in mind that we don't do nasty things like 
faking program runs, and that the programs really do 
work. Real bugs tend to be rather subtle. 

Creative Computing is concerned with maintaining and 
improving the quality of its software, so we are interested 
in hearing about genuine errors in the games. We will 
consider bug reports if the following rules are adhered to: 


1) The program must be in Microsoft BASIC. We don't 
want to have anything to do with converted programs. 

2) The problem must be described in writing and, if 
available, hard copy of the program LIST and RUN 
should be included. 

3) Include an SASE if you want a reply. 


These restrictions may seem severe, but please under- 
stand that there are tens of thousands of copies of this book 
wandering around, and we'd have no time for anything 
else if everyone who hit a snag called us for a half-hour 
debugging session on the phone, only to find he didn't 
really know how his RND function worked after all. (It's 
Strange, but there are certain programs in the first volume, 
BASIC Computer Games, which definitely do work, but 
which people seem to have incredible difficulty with. You 
cant imagine how many times I've picked up the phone 
and heard, “| have your BASIC Computer Games book, 
and | have a problem with this BANNER program on 
page...’) 


General Hints 


There are four primary areas of difficulty in transporting 
a program from Microsoft BASIC to some other. 


1. Multiple Statements. |In Microsoft BASIC, multiple 
statements separated by a colon (:) are allowed. Some 
BASICs use a backslash. Some don't have multiple 
statements. Another difficulty arises in the handling of 
IF...THENs in multiple statement lines. In Microsoft 
BASIC, when an IF condition ts false, control passes to the 
next line, not the next statement. In other words, if the IF 
condition is false, the entire remainder of the line is 
skipped over. Here’s an example of converting multiple 
statements: 


Before 


10 DIM Q(10): INPUT K: LET 2-1 

20 FOR I=1 TO K: PRINT: NEXT | 

30 IF K=3 THEN PRINT “This or That”: GOSUB 900: 
GOTO 500 

40 REM More Stuff. . . 


After 


10 DIM Q(10) 

12 INPUT K 

14 LET Z=1 

20 FOR t=1 TO K 

22 PRINT 

24 NEXT | 

30 IF K<> 3 THEN 40 
32 PRINT “This or That” 
34 GOSUB 900 

36 GOTO 500 

40 REM More Stuff... 


2. FOR Loops. In Microsoft BASIC, a FOR loop is always 
executed at least once. The test to decide if the loop is to 
be terminated is done when the corresponding NEXT 
statement is encountered. In general this is undesirable 
and you may notice that in some programs a patch was 
made to compensate for this quirk. The real problem of 
compatibility between BASICs is in how BASIC knows 
which loops to keep track of, and which ones to forget. In 


Xl 


Microsoft BASIC, a FOR loop is considered to be done 
when it finishes normally (falls out of the NEXT state- 
ment), if it is restarted, or if it nested within a loop that is 
restarted. Some BASICs frown sternly on the practice of 
jumping out of a loop, which can be real trouble. (This 
happens in North Star BASIC, Polymorphic BASIC, and 
Processor Tech Extended BASIC.) If this difficulty occurs, 
then convert the FOR loops back toIF... THEN structures. 
For instance: 


10 INPUT I,J 
10 INPUT I,J 20 K=I 
20 FOR K=I TO J 30 PRINT “Some stuff” 
30 PRINT “Some stuff” 40 K=K+1 
40 NEXT K 45 |1F K~ = J THEN 30 
50 END 50 END 


The NEXT verb by itself (without an argument), always 
refers to the most recent FOR statement. Generally we've 
avoided this feature. 


3. Arrays. Some programs use zero as an array subscript. 
Your BASIC may not like this. If your arrays start at one, 
and the program tries to use zero, then just add one to all 
the array subscripts. (Within the context of a particular 
program, there are often niftier ways of getting around this 
problem, but unless you can tell what's going on inside the 
program, this is the most painless way.) 


4. Character Strings. There are two different methods of 
taking a substring from a longer string. In Hewlett- 
Packard style BASIC, substrings are in the form X$(I,J) 
which takes characters from position | through J out of X$, 
and X$(I) which takes everything from position | and to the 
right. Microsoft BASIC, styled after DEC, uses LEFT$, 
RIGHT$, and MID$. Here’s how to convert. 


LEFT$(X$,1) X$(1,1) 
RIGHT$(X$,!) X$(LEN(X$)-1+1) 
MID$(A$.I,J) X$(I,1+J-1) 


Another potential problem exists with strings. Some of 
the programs use string arrays, but some BASICs just 
dont have string arrays. If you see a character string ina 
DIM statement, then it’s a string array, not a scalar. If your 
BASIC doesn't have string arrays, then you're probably out 
of luck, unless the array is rather smail and you can pack 
the whole string array into a scalar. For instance, let's say 
we have array A$(0-3). 


A$(0)="HORSE” 


A$(1)="DOG" 
A$(2)="FISH" 
A$(3)="CAT” 


If we decide in advance that no word will have more than 
five characters, then we can stuff this whole thing into one 
string, A$. 


A$="HORSEDOG FISH CAT 


Notice that each word takes up five positions, even if the 
extra ones must be made up with blanks. Thus our old 
A$(0) is now in positions 1-5, A$(1) in positions 6-10, etc. 
We can generalize that A$(n) is translated into positions 
5*n+1 through 5*n+5. Obviously, the ability to use this 
method to substitute for string arrays depends on how big 
you can make the one big string scalar to take its place.

Artillery 3 





RUN 


In this game, two or three humans 
may play. Each one of them has an 
artillery piece and is firing at an 
opponent. The first person to destroy 
his opponent wins that round of the 
game. The parameters for distances 
and muzzle velocities of the artillery 
pieces are set at the beginning of the 
game. The shots are fired by giving a 
firing angle expressed in degrees from 
the horizontal. 

In a three player game, you may elect 
which player you are firing at; hence 
player one and three could both be firing 
at player two. Once one of the players is 
eliminated, it becomes a two player game 
and the remaining two players fire at each 
other. 

Personally, | would prefer to think of 
this game as lobbing mudpies or 
snowballs or custard cream pies or 
something non-destructive. However, 
it was originally written as shoot-'em- 
up game so that’s how it appears here. 

This game was originally written by 
Mike Forman and further revised by 
N.E. Lyon and Brian West. It first 
appeared in Creative Computing, 
Jan/Feb 1976.

Baccarat 





Games of the baccarat and chemin 
de fer family originated in the baccarat 
that became popular in the French 
casinos in the 1830's. In the present 
century they have travelled from Eu- 
rope to the United States, back to 
Europe, and to casinos throughout the 
world. This process has resulted in 
wide variations in playing rules and 
what is called “baccarat” in one casino 
may more nearly resemble the “chemin 
de fer” of another. 

The computer game here is more 
nearly chemin de fer than it is baccarat. 
The rules, briefly, are as follows: Eight 
packs of cards are shuffled together 
and placed in a “shoe” from which the 
cards can be slid out one by one. 
Following this, the players make their 
bets. Any player may make any bet up 
to the amount of the bank. The player at 
the banker's right has the first choice to 
bet. Any part of the bank he does not 
take may be bet by the next player on 
his right, and so on in order until the 
entire bank is covered or until everyone 
has bet who wishes to. Any player may 
take the entire bank by saying, “Ban- 
co,” but when two or more players wish 
to banco, the one nearest the banker's 
right has the privilege. 

After the bets are placed, the banker 
deals two hands of two cards each, 
dealing one card at atime. The hand he 
deals first represents all the players 
betting against him; the other hand is 
the banker's. The player who has made 
the largest bet against the banker plays 
the opposition hand. 

The object of the game is to hold two 
or three cards which count nine (9), or 
as nearly nine as possible. The values 
of the cards are: face cards and tens, 
zero; aces, one each; any other card, its 
number. Units of ten points are dis- 
regarded, so that nine plus seven count 
as six, not sixteen. 

A player whose card is nine or eight 
in his first two cards shows his hand 
immediately. He has a natural and his 
hand wins (but a natural nine beats a 
natural eight). Naturals of the same 
number tie, and there is a new deal. 

When the result is not decided by a 
natural, the banker must give a card to 
his opponent on request; or the oppo- 
nent may stand. The opponent must 
stand on six or seven, must draw to a 
zero, one, two, three, or four, but has 
the option on five. The additional card, 
if given, is face up. 


Then the banker decides whether to 
stand or take a card. 


IF BANKER GIVES BANKER STANDS ON BANKER DRAWS TO 
Face card or ten 4,5,6, 7 3,2, 1,0 

Nine 4,5, 6, 7 (or 3) 2, 1, 0 (or 3) 

Eight 3, 4, 5,6, 7 2,1,0 

Seven or six 7 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,0 

Five or four 6, 7 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,0 

Three or two 5, 6, 7 4,3, 2, 1,0 

Ace 4,5,6,7 3,2, 1,0 

Opponent stands 6,7 5, 4,3, 2, 1,0 


Neither player may have more than 
one additional card, giving him three 
cards at the most. When each player 
has exercised his option, the cards are 
shown. If the totals are the same, the 
bets are off and may be withdrawn and 
new bets are placed exactly as before 
for another deal. If the opponent has a 


higher number than the banker's, each 
player collects such portion of the bank 
as he has covered. 

In the game of chemin de fer, the role 
of banker rotates among the players 
after each hand; in baccarat, it does 
not.

Big 6 is strictly an American inven- 
tion from the casinos of Nevada. There 
is a very large wheel mounted vertical- 
ly, generally four feet or more in 
diameter, that has the numbers one 
through six in a random arrangement 
around its periphery. Players place 
their bets on a roulette type of table in 
front of the wheel. The wheel is then 
spun and three numbers are declared 
the winners. These are the three 
numbers that appear at the top of the 
wheel. Most novice players looking at 
the wheel think that since there are 
three winners they have a very good 
chance of winning a large sum of 
money. Betting limits are generally up 
to $500 and, as many players discover 
very quickly, the odds are very heavily 
in favor of the house. 

If you feel that you must play Big 6, 
try it by computer first and then figure 
out how much you can afford to lose 
when you go to play it in Las Vegas or 
Atlantic City. The computer is a much

This game tests your skills in binary- 
to-decimal and decimal-to-binary con- 
version. You are given twenty conver- 
sion trials. Numbers are chosen 
randomly and your score is printed at 
the end. The answer to any conversion 
you miss is displayed; if the next 
conversion is presented, you may 
assume you got the previous one 
correct. 





There are several possible 
modifications for this program such as 
timing the response, allowing the user 
to specify the number range, checking 
for duplicate numbers, or extending it 
to other bases. 

This program was written by Ted 
Park of Pacific Union College. It 
Originally appeared in Creative Com- 
puting, Mar/Apr 1975.

Description: Black Box is a computerized version of the 
game that appeared in the August 1977 issue of Games 
and Puzzles. The Black Box is an 8-by-8 square in which 
several atoms are hidden. The object of the game is to 
discover the positions of the atoms by projecting rays at 
them from the sides of the box and noticing how these rays 
are deflected, reflected, or absorbed. Rays enter the box 
across one of the four edges and travel horizontally or 
vertically. The entry points are numbered from 1 to 32, 
counterclockwise, starting at the top of the left edge. 

To play the game, you first specify how many atoms to 
place in the Black Box. Then you type in the point at which 
you send the ray into the box, and you are told whether the 
ray was absorbed or where it emerged. Type a zero to end 
the game and print the board. The path of the ray is 
governed by the following rules: 


(1) Rays that strike an atom directly are absorbed. 

(2) Rays that come within one square of an atom ina 
diagonal direction (so that they would pass next to the 
atom if they continued) are deflected by 90 degrees. 

(3) Rays aimed between two atoms one square apart are 
reflected. 

(4) Rays that enter on either side of an atom on the edge 
of the box are reflected. 

(5) Rays otherwise travel in straight lines. 

The game is pretty interesting with four or five atoms, 
but can get out of hand with too many more. Occasionally, 
an atom can be masked by others. This doesn't occur 
often, but sometimes the position is truly ambiguous 
(more often, there is only one place the atom can be). For 
competitive play, score one point for reflections and 
absorptions, two for rays which emerge from the box, and 
five points for each atom guessed incorrectly. 

This program and description were written by Jeff 
Kenton. A previous version appeared in Creative Com- 
puting, May/Jun 1978.

Bobstones 





The idea for this number game was 

. derived from aé contest called 

“Bobstones” described in the novel 

Watership Down. The object of 

Bobstones is to guess three things 
about the roll of a pair of dice. 


1. If the sum of the dice 


is odd or even............. 1 point 
2. The sum of the dice...... 2 points 
3. The number on each 

of the two dice........... 3 points 


The winner is the first player to score 
eleven points. If atie results, the winner 
is the first player to break the tie. 

In this computer version of the game, 
you are playing against the computer. 
However, the computer makes its 
guess before the dice are “rolled.” 
Hence, it has no real advantage over its 
human opponent. 

This game was written by Dohn 
Addleman. It originally appeared in 
Creative Computing Mar/Apr 1976.

This program simulates the Italian 
game of Bocce also called ‘lawn 
bowls” or just “bowls.” 

The instructions starting at the line 
1770 explain the game. 

This is the four-ball version (Q=5). 
Allowing more balls in the game 
(raising Q) will increase central 
processing time since the chances of 
collision will rise and the resulting 
position of each ball has to be recom- 
puted. However, the delay is short and 
we routinely play six to eight balls. 
Increasing Q beyond 9 will require 
redimensioning the arrays at line 1030. 

When there is collision, the bell will 
sound (line 1500). 

It is important to remember that the 
object is to get close to the jack and not 
to hit it. Upon collision, the jack will 
move off more quickly than a ball 
because it is smaller and lighter. A 
careless shot can turn a good game 
into a disaster. 

It requires some imagination to play 
the game well. It goes best if you 
imagine that you are standing at 
coordinates 0,0 and are looking out 
along the X-axis. 

This game and the description above 
were written by Victor Bendall of 
Eastern Kentucky University. It 
Originally appeared in Creative Com- 
puting, Jul/Aug 1977.

DC YOU WEED INSTRUCTIONS? ENTER YES OR NOY YES 


IN THIS GAME YOU ROLL 4 BALLS SUCCESSIVELY AT A TARGET 

BALL (CALLED A JACK). THE OBJECT IS TO GET THE BALLS AS CLOSE 
TO THE JACK AS POSSIBLE. THE BALLS ARE 10 CH IW DIAMETER AND 
ARE VEIGHTED SO THAT THEY ROLL IN A CURVE. YOU WILL HAVE TO 
ROLL THER AT AN ANGLE TO THE LINE FROM YOU AT COORDINATES 0,0 
TO THE JACK AT COORBIWATES X,Y. A POSITIVE ANGLE WILL MAKE 
THE BALL CURVE CLOCKWISE. A WEGITIVE ANGLE WILL MAKE IT CURVE 
ANTI-CLOCKUISE. THE JACK 1S A 4 CH VIDE AND WILL ROLL 
STRAIGHT IF YOU HIT IT. BALLS HIT BY YOUR THROWN BALL MAY 
CURVE IN EITHER BIRECTION.

A Boga is a bogus animal or mythical 
beast in the Hurkle family. Like a 
Hurkle, the Boga hides on a grid with 
dimensions up to 20 by 20. It sends out 
clues that tell you which direction to 
move from where you are to where it is. 
However, one major difference 
between a Boga and a Hurkle is the 
Boga is also seeking you out at the 
same time you are looking for it. You 
don't have to tell it which directions to 
go after each of its guesses to get 
closer to you. It apparently has a very 
good nose and can tell on its own. 
However, it plays fairly and gives you 
the first guess, and then it takes its 
guess. Guesses continue alternately 
until one or the other, human or boga, 
find the opposing player. At the begin- 
ning of the game, you may print out the 
grid if you wish to make your guessing 
job slightly easier. Remember, direc- 
tions in this game correspond to the 
diagram; that is, north is up and east is 
to the right. 

This game was created by David 
Strickler.

Bombrun 





Bombrun is an extremely accurate 
simulation of an aircraft dropping a 
bomb on a very small target. You may 
specify whether the aircraft is climbing, 
diving, and the angle in degrees. You 
may specify speed in feet per second; 
you may also specify at what point you 
wish to drop the bomb. The program 
gives you four passes over the target. 

A perfect hit is possible but extreme- 
ly difficult to achieve. A hit within 300 
feet of the target is considered 
“threatening” while hits outside of that 
range may be considered a negative 
commentary on your knowledge of 
physics. 

This program was originally written 
by Jim Prelesnik. 


DONBRUN 
CREATIVE CORPUTING 
MORRISTOUN, HEU JERSEY 


THIS PROGRAM SIMULATES A BOMBING RUN. BO YOU NEED 
INSTRUCTIONS? YES 

YOU WAVE THE OPTION OF MAKING FOUR PASSES OVER THE TARGET, 
VITH THE ABILITY TO BROP A BOND ONCE BURING EACH OF 

THESE PASSES. ALTITUDE CHANGES MAYBE MABE THROUGH THE 
“CLIMB/DIVE’ COMMAND BY PRINTING “CLINB’ OR “BIVE’ ,FOL- 
LOVED BY A COMMA AND THE DESIRED ANGLE (CIN DEGREES). WEY 
VELOCITIES (RANGING FROM 300 TO 900 FEET PER SECOND) MAY 
BE INPUT AFTER THE “AIRSPEED” QUESTION MARK. ‘CLIMS/BIVE’ 
ANGLES, VARYING FROM 0 TO 15 DEGREES, WILL ABD AS SPEC- 
IFIED BY “CLIMB” OR’ DIVE’ COMMANSS TO YIELD A RET INCLIW- 
ATION/DECLIWATION ANGLE BETUEEN 0 TO 60 DEGREES, CLIMBING 
OR DIVING. A MINIMUM ALTITUBE OF 100 FEET MUST ALSO DE 
MAINTAINER. WILLFULLY EXCEEDING ANY OF THE RAX./MIN. SPECS 
VILL RESULT IW THE CRASH OF YOUR BOMBER. ALSO , A BOND 
COMMAND OF “DROP’ DURING A DIVE VILL GIVE YOUR BOMB AN IN- 
ITIAL DOUMUARD VELOCITY, SHORTENING THE DROP TIME, AS A 
“CLIMB’ COMMAND WILL LENGTHEN THIS TIME. THE BOND UILL BE 
LAUNCHED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOUING THE MOST RECENT “STATS” READ- 
OUT UPON “BROP’ COMMAND, AND VILL BE HELD FOR FURTHER 
POSITIONING INFORMATION UPON THE COMMAND “STAND BY’. THE

Bridge-it is a two-player pencil and 
paper logic game. One player is 
represented by X’s, the other by O's. 
The X’s and O’s are arranged in an 
alternating grid pattern so that X’s may 
be joined to one another by a line 
without crossing an O and O's may be 
joined to one another without crossing 
an X. The object of the game is for the 
X's to draw a line from the top to the 
bottom of the board. The O’s must 
connect a continuous chain from the 
right to the left of the board. Players 
move alternately and may go any place 
on the grid. Any two of your symbols,

either X’s or O’s, may be connected 
together on a given move. 

In this particular version of the game, 
the computer is your opponent. The 
computer plays the X's and you play 
the O’s. The computer moves first, 
which gives it a very slight advantage. If 
you find it is too formidable an oppo- 
nent you may wish to modify the 
program to allow the player to move 
first. At any point during the game you 
may ask for a printout of the board and 
see how the play is progressing. 

This program was written by Michael 
Kass, Miles Barel, and Alan Segal.

In this game of high adventure, your 
object is to travel 200 miles across the 
great Gobi Desert. You're being chased 
by a tribe of knock-kneed pygmies. 
You have one quart of water which will 
last you for six drinks; it may be 
renewed if you find an oasis or, if you 
are found by another traveller, you may 
get an additional half-quart of water. 
During your journey you encounter all 
types of hazards such as sand storms, 
wild Berbers and possible injuries to 
your camel. 

Warning: this is a very hazardous and 
addictive game. It is also very difficult 
to win. In ten plays of the game, the 
maximum distance we were able to 
travel was 159 miles, and in many cases 
we managed to make only seven or 
eight miles before one of the hazards 
caused our demise. 

This game was submitted by the 
Heath Users Group.

Chuck-a-luck is generally found in 
fairgrounds, cheap casinos, and small 
gambling parlors. It flourished in 
frontier America, but dates back to 
European gaming houses of the 
eighteenth century. During its long 
history, chuck-a-luck has had many 
names including sweatcloth, chucker- 
luck, chuck luck, and bird cage. 

Each player places his bets on one of 
the six numbers, one through six. 
When all bets have been placed, the 
operator tumbles three dice in a chuck 
cage until they come to rest face up or 
drop down a chute onto the table. If a 
player's number appears on one die, 
the operator pays him even money; if 
on two dice, two to one; if on three dice, 
three to one. 

The computer version of Chuck-a- 
luck was Originally written by Michael 
Tanoff.

In this game, you are situated at the 
center of a target area for a UFO. The 
program assigns coordinates 0,0 to 
your location. You are given informa- 
tion as to the course of the UFO in 
degrees longitude and degrees latitude 
and also its speed. You then have two 
alternatives. One, you can attempt to 
shoot the UFO out of the sky with an 
ICBM or you can do nothing and hope 
that air friction will cause the course of 
the UFO to deviate or to burn up. 

A knowledge of mathematical coor- 
dinate systems will be of some 
assistance in winning this game, 
although you'll probably be able to 
discover a reasonably good strategy by 
yourself using trial and error if you play 
enough games. 

This program was originally written 
by Chris Falco.

This program is a computer version 
of an old card trick which never fails to 
get some ooohs and aaahs from the 
uninitiated. The dealer, or magician, 
takes twenty-one random cards, deals 
them out in three piles of seven cards 
each. You then tell him which column 
(or which pile) contains your card. He 
then picks up the three columns from 
right to left, putting the right pile on the 
top, and then deals the deck out again 
horizontally. In other words the top 
card of the right column now becomes 
the top card of the left column; the 
second card in the right column now 
becomes the first card in the middle 
column; the third card of the right 
column becomes the first card in the 
third column, and so on. After he deals 
Out all twenty-one cards in this way, 
you again tell him which column your 
card appears in. The magician then 
picks up the three piles in the same 
order and deals them out once again. 
Again you tell him which column 
contains your card. He then deals the 
cards out one by one face up and 
identifies yours when he comes to it. 
Don't ask me how he does it! Maybe 
you can figure it out from the program, 
but it works every time. 

This program was originally written 
by Alan Barnes.

Concentration 








This children’s card game for any 
number of players is also called 
memory, or peimanism. It is easy to 
play and is an excellent test of memory 
and observation. The computer version 


here simulates the actual game except nN senesnnnians 

that it only allows one player to play. In CREATIVE COMPUTING AMORRISTOUN NEU JERSE! 
the actual game, one player shuffles a 

deck of playing cards and lays them 

face down on a table in all directions FIRST CARD? 1 

and so that no card is touching SECOND CARD? 2 

another. Each player tries to collect as St 

many cards as possible by turning up 

pairs with the same rank per a number FIRST CARD? 13 

or picture. The first player to go turns SECONY CARD’ 2 

over two cards at random and allows SOCCCRCESRRSGRCRRSERSaRRNeeER 

the other players to see them. If the 

rank of the two cards is the same, for einst cane Sa 

example, two aces or two kings, he THERE ARE ONLY 52 CARDS IN THE DECK, NOT 53 
takes them and may turn over two more FIRST CARD? 41 

cards. He continues in this way until he SECOND CARD? 37 


turns over two cards that do not match. OUCOUUERCGOORCCEROOSERRRCESEL

the game. SECOND CARD? 49 

In this computer version of the game, pn A NGC ee 3s 
the cards are numbered on their face ei ee eae

turn over two cards, their rank is typed FIRST CARD? 43 
on the terminal. If they do not match, ERODE ONDE OOE: | 
their rank is obliterated by successive ie ee oe

is analogous to the situation of placing

This is the old childhood favorite of 
“connect the dots.” The objective is to 
Carve out squares of ‘real estate” with 
the computer as an able adversary. The 
player who connects the two dots 
which complete a square’ gets 
ownership of that square. In addition, 
the player gets the added bonus of 
moving once more. This can be quite 


advantageous in certain situations. A RUN adi 
nine-square grid is provided as a CREATIVE COMPUTING 
playing board. MORRISTOWN, NEU JERSEY 


A sample of the grid follows with an 
identification of each coordinate where 


a line may be drawn. THIS PROGRAM WILL PLAY CONNECT THE DOTS WITH YOU. 


THE GAME IS PLAYED ON A 4 X 4 ARRAY. WHEN

This is a naval war game played ona 
10 by 10 grid. You are a submarine and 
the computer plays the role of the 
convoy consisting of a cargo ship and 
two destroyers. One destroyer acts as 
the escort traveling alongside the 
cargo ship, while the other searches for 
the submarine and tries to destroy it. 
The destroyer which is searching for 
the submarine moves from zero to 
three squares at a time, searching. The 
other destroyer stays within one 
square of the ship. The submarine 
starts in square #12 and can move up, 
down, left, or right one square at atime 
with two moves per turn. It has four 
torpedoes which may be fired one at a 
time in any straight direction, horizon- 
tally, vertically, or diagonally. 

The game ends when either the 
submarine destroys the cargo ship or 
when one of the two destroyers gets 
the submarine.

GAME" s 








CORRAL is agame program inspired 
by Harry (short for Aragon), a horse 
acquired in a rash moment of in- 
dulgence for a teen-age daughter. 
Harry, in his own inimitable style, 
taught us much about the care, feeding 
and psychology of the equine species. 
Some of that hard-won psychology has 
found its way into CORRAL, which is a 
one-dimensional simulation of the two- 
(and almost three-) dimensional 
problem of catching Harry for anything 
other than food. The main reason for 
confining Harry's alter ego in the 
computer to only one dimension is 
simply to conserve paper on hard-copy 
terminals. Even so, the presentation is 
very effective on a video display unit. 

The corral itself is bounded by a pair 
of siderails represented by upper-case 
| characters separated by 21 spaces. 
The cowboy C always enters beside the 
leftmost rail while the horse H is 
happily mooching somewhere 
between positions 10 and 18 with a bias 
towards the right. This bias and the 
various other behavioral peculiarities 
of the horse are governed by two data 
matrices (statements 90 and 100) 
which may be altered to vary the 
beast’s temperament from wild to 
docile depending on the data distribu- 
tion. 

If the horse bolts, a check is made 
(line 450) to ensure that it does not 
reach a position less than one space 
away from the cowboy. Occasionally, 
the horse bolts te a position more 
advantageous to the cowboy, just as in 
real life, but usually the opposite is 
true, particularily when it bolts as a 
result of an incautious approach by the 
cowboy. So heed with care the advice 
for the cowboy not to advance by more 
than half the separation in any one 
move except when adjacent to the 
horse, of course! 

The probability that the horse may 
kick when the cowboy moves close is 
set by the IF statement at line 500. The 
cowboy is immobilized for from one to 
five moves, while the horse canters 
happily away from the scene of his 
triumph. If this happens more than a 
certain (random) number of times the 
round-up is terminated by the depar- 
ture of the cowboy in an ambulance. 





Occasionally the horse decides to 
engage in a friendly dance around the 
cowboy, but remember that random 
number generators have no soul and 
the result is often vile treachery as the 
horse delivers a fatal kick at the very 
moment when aé successful catch 
seems assured. On the other hand, the 
skill of an accomplished CORRAL 
cowboy can result in a catch within 
three moves with no injuries sustained. 
You either have it or you have not, as 
the saying goes. In the latter case the 


program allows a maximum of 100 
moves before relegating the luckless 
cowboy to cookhouse chores. 

Computer freaks with multi-color 
graphics will no doubt be dissatisfied 
with such prosaic symbols as H and C 
for the horse and cowboy. A fully 
animated CORRAL in living color (with 
sound effects by a music or speech 
synthesizer—a_ talking horse yet!) 
should not be too difficult to achieve. 

Program and description are by 
Colin Keay.

The program Countdown is based on 
the program Guess in which the 
computer chooses a random number 
and then gives you clues whether you 
are too high or too low until you finally 
get the number. In Countdown, the 
program adds a little interest to this 
guessing game by giving you a certain 
number of tries to get the mystery 
number between one and ten before 
your schoolbuilding explodes. Using a 
good guessing strategy should allow 
you to get any number in four or fewer 
tries. If you take more than four tries, 
the building goes “boom.” To add a 
little more interest to the game, you 
may want to make the maximum 
number of tries three. To do this 
change the value of T in statement 45 
from 4 to 3. 

Countdown was written by Mark 
Chambers.

Cup is a cute little game in which a 
cup is located thirty lines down the 
paper of your terminal or thirty lines 
down on your video display screen and 
a random number of spaces from one 
to sixty to the right of the left margin. 
The pull of gravity varies from one to 
ten lines per second per second. You 
are then asked in this program what 
push you would like to give the ball 
from left to right across the paper in 
spaces per second. The program then 
traces the path of the ball from the left 
margin of the paper as it falls down and 
hopefully into the cup. 

A knowledge of physics is helpful if 
you wish to get the ball in the cup on 
the first try. However, you can diddle 
with it by trial and error and generally 
hit the cup on your fourth or fifth try. 

Cup was written by Jonathan 
Freidin.

Deepspace is another version of a 
space battle. You become the com- 
mander of either a scout ship, cruiser,

In this game, you are in an ex- 
perimental building with one million 
rooms in it. The building is one 
hundred rooms long, one hundred 
rooms wide, and one hundred rooms 
high. 

You have just received a telephone 
call from a mad bomber who tells you 
he has planted a bomb someplace in 
the building. Fortunately you are 
armed with a bomb detector that 
registers a stronger and stronger signal 
as you get closer to the bomb. You start 
at the bottom right-hand door of the 
building, at the room 0,0,0. in response 
to the signals from your detector, every 
ten seconds you may try anew room to 
search for the bomb. You have two 
hundred seconds or twenty trials to 
find it. 

It’s fairly easy to find the bomb once 
you get the knack of how your detector 
works. However, we're not going to 
spoil it for you and tell the secret.

DODGEM is a game originally devis- 
ed in 1972 by Colin Vout, then astudent 


at the University of Cambridge, 
England. It got its major publicity from 
Martin Gardner who discussed it in the 
June 1975 issue of Scientific American. 
Complete instructions are in the sam- 
ple run. 

It may be played by two players in 
which case the computer is the referee, 
or by one player against the computer. 
The computer, incidentally, plays un- 
commonly well. This is not surprising 
since Dodgem was written by the very 
talented and prolific Mac Oglesby.

Doors 





In this cute little game, there are four 
doors in succession and you must 
open them to get the prize behind the 
last one. You have a key ring con- 
taining eleven keys numbered zero to 
ten (computer people have a different 
way of numbering things than normal 
people) and you have fourteen tries to 
open all four doors. As an added 
hooker, some keys may open more 
than one door. If at first you don't 
succeed, try, try again. The prizes 
behind the fourth door are well worth 
the patience in trying to get them all 
open. 

Doors was conceived and written by 
Bill Ingram.

DRAG allows the user to design his 
own dragster and then race it against a 
dragster designed by another player or 
the computer. You must specify the 
horsepower, rear end ratio, tire width, 
and tire diameter. There are no limits to 
these parameters. 

Aha! you Say. “I'll just design a two 
million horsepower dragster!” But it 
doesn't work that way, because your 
mass is related to your engine size, and 
SO you usually end up with a top speed 
of something like 33 MPH. The com- 
puter is extremely hard to beat, but it’s 
rumored that it can be done. Note: on 
some systems the amount of time 
between printouts can be aggravating- 
ly long. 

This program came_ from. the 
Hewlett-Packard User Library. It also 
appeared in Creative Computing, 
Jan/Feb 1977.

Dr. Z 


Using DR.Z your computer “in- 
teracts” with you in true Rogerian form, 
never making a value judgment of your 


response. 
DR.Z is multi-lingual and 
‘professional confidence’ is 


guaranteed, especially with a video 
display terminal. However, if you have 
a printer, try employing a unique 
language known only to you and Dr.Z. 
If you would prefer toemploy DR.Z in 
an educational mode, you might con- 
sider the following sequence of ac- 
tivities. 
1. Discuss communication, exploring: 
a. The role of spoken language 
b. The role of written language 
c. Non-verbal language 
1. facial expressions 
2. posture of body 
3. hand gestures 
2. Experience a session with DR.Z. 
3. Develop computerizations of other 
“purely human” situations. 


Note: Don’t mistake DR.Z for Eliza 
(or Doctor). In OR.Z, all the responses 
are “canned” and the computer makes 
no attempt to analyze your input in any 
way. 

DR.Z was submitted to us 
anonymously by some students of Dr. 
Melvin Zeddies of San Diego.

Description: ELIZA is a program that 
accepts natural English as input and 
carrieS on aé_ reasonably coherent 
conversation based on the psychoana- 
lytic techniques of Carl Rogers. You will 
have to forgive ELIZA for being a poor 
English student. You'll find that it is best 
not to use punctuation in your input, and 
you Ilhavetocarry the conversation. But 
it does work! 


How it works: In order to speak to you, 
ELIZA must: (1) get a string from the 
user, and prepare it for further 
processing: (2) find the keywords in the 
input string: (3) if a keyword is found, 
take the part of the string following the 
keyword and “translate allthe personal 
pronouns and verbs (‘‘l’’ becomes 
“YOU", “ARE” becomes ‘AM’, etc.); (4) 
finally, look up an appropriate reply based 
onthe keyword which was found, printit 
and, if necessary, the “translated” 
string. ELIZA uses four types of program 
data to accomplish this: 

(1) 36 keyword, such as “1AM”, “WHY 
DONT YOU", and “COMPUTER”. The 
keywords must be in order of priority, so 
ELIZA will key on “YOU ARE” before 
“YOU”. 

(2) 12 strings used for the translation or 
conjugation process. These are in pairs 
such that if one member of the pair is 
found, the other is substituted for it. 
Examples: ““Y’’, "YOU", “AM”, “ARE”, 
etc. 

(3) 112 reply strings. The strings are 
arranged in groups corresponding tothe 
keywords. There is no fixed number of 
different replies for each keyword. 
Replies ending ina‘‘*’’ aretobe followed 
by the translated string, while the 
strings ending in normal punctuation 
are to be printed alone. 


(4) Numerical data to determine which 
replies to print for each keyword. For 
each keyword there ts a pair of numbers 
signifying (start of reply strings, number 
of reply strings). Thus the fifth pair of 
number, (10,4), means that the replies 
for the fifth keyword (‘| DONT") start 
with thetenth reply string, andthatthere 
are four replies. 


Detailed Explanation: 

Lines 10-160: Initialization. Arrays and 
strings are dimensioned. N1, N2, and 
N3, which represent the number of 
keywords, number of translation strings, 
and number of replies respectively, are 
defined. Then the arrays are filled. 
S(keyword number) is the ordinal 
number of the start of the reply strings 
for a given keyword, R(keyword number) 


is the actual reply to be used next, and 
N(keyword number) is the last reply for 
that keyword. Finally an introduction is 
printed. 

Lines 170-255: User input section. This 
part of the program gets a string fromthe 
user, places a space at the start of the 
String and two at the end (to make it 
easier to correctly locate keywords and 
to preventsubscripting out of bounds), 
throws out all the apostrophes (so DONT 
and DON'T are equivalent), and stops tf 
the word SHUT is found in the input 
String (which it takes to mean SHUT UP). 
ELIZA also checks for repetitive input by 
the user. 

Lines 260-370: Keyword-finding sec- 
tion. ELIZA scans the input string for 
keywords and saves the keyword of 
highest priority temporarily in S, T, and 
FS. If no keyword is found, the keyword 
defaults to number 36, NOKEYFOUND 
(which causes ELIZA to say something 
noncommital) and it skips the next 
section. 

Lines 380-555. Translation or Conjuga- 
tion section. The part of the input string 
following the keyword is saved. Then 
pairs of translation strings, as described 
above, are read and upon the occurence 
of one of these strings, the other is 
substituted for it. When this is done 
ELIZA makes sure there is only one 
leading space in the translated string. 
Lines 560-640: Reply printing section. 
Using R(keyword number), S(keyword 
number), and N(keyword number), the 
correct reply is located. The pointer for 
the next reply is bumped and reset if it is 
too large. If the reply string ends ina ‘’*"’ 
it is printed with the translated string, 
otherwise it ts printed alone. The 
previously entered input string is saved 
to permit checking for repetetive input, 
and then ELIZA goes back for more input.

Usage

Input string 


Limitations: Runs in 16K of memory. 


Modifications: You can easily add, 
change, or delete any of the keywords, 
translation words, or replies. Remem- 
ber, you will also have to change N1, N2, 
N3, and/or the numerical data. Justasa 
suggestion, if you decide to insert ““ME”’ 
and “YOU” in the translation string list, 
put a nonprinting (control) character in 
YOU to prevent ELIZA from substi- 
tuting l» YOU+ME. This means that YOU 
will always be assumed to be the subject 
of a verb, never the object, but resolving 
that difficulty is a whole different 
problem. 


A Few Comments: The structures 
found in lines 120, 420, and 590 could 
be replaced by RESTORE NNNN 
statements if your BASIC has them. The 
use of an INSTR, SEARCH, or POS 
function to determine if one string is a 
substring of another would probably 
speed things up considerably (it takes 
ELIZA around 10 seconds to think of a 
reply). 


What it all means: we'll leave to you. 
Although this program is an inferior 
imitation of the original, itdoes work. Itis 
pretty farfetched to believe that a 
psycholanalyst is nothing but a sentence- 
input-keyword-finder-conjugator-reply 
finder, but if you really think so, you can 
buy your computer a speech-recognition 
unit, a Computalker and a green couch, 
and charge $75/hr! My computer, the 
doctor! 


Geneology: ELIZA was _ originally 
programmed in LISP by Joseph Weizen- 
baum at MIT. It was converted to BASIC 
by Jeff Shrager and further modified to 
work in Microsoft BASIC by Steve North, 
who also wrote these notes.

Father 





This program loosely simulates a 
debate with your father about going 
out on Saturday night. After you win or 
lose the debate, then Saturday night 
approaches and you must decide 
whether or not to actually go out. When 
all is said and done, the computer will 
give you a score on a scale of minus 
seven to plus four. (This could have 
been a scale of zero to ten, but 
computers have this magic ability to 
give us scales of anything we want). 

This program originated in the 
dungeons of Digital Equipment Cor- 
poration and was whipped into its 
present form by Victor Nahigian.

This game may be the only one so easy that even 
an animal could play it, yet hard for people to play 
even as well as random chance. It may be useful in 
training the intuition, and improving gamesmanship 
in speculation-type activities, where each player is 
trying to outguess the other's behavior and stay one 
step ahead. 

On each turn, the program first selects ‘yes’ or 
‘no’, but gives you no information about its decision. 
Therefore your guess on the first turn is pure chance, 
there is no skill involved. But soon the program 
Starts using patterns in your behavior, making its 
decisions to increase the chance of your next guess 
being wrong. And to make it harder for you, the pro- 
gram doesn't strictly maximize its chances, but 
throws a little randomness into its decisions. 


Variations 


There are endless strategies for programming this 
game, for there could be almost infinitely many defi- 
nitions of what a “pattern” is. No single algorithm 
could be “best”, because it must assume a model 
of the human player, and people are different, even 
the same person from moment to moment. Any good 
algorithm must build or refine its model of the 
player, during the course of the game. 

This particular program keeps an array of 16 prob- 
ability estimates; the person’s last two guesses, and 
whether they were right or wrong (16 situations alto- 
gether) determine which estimate is selected. The 
array (which depends on ail previous play within 
the game) becomes a model or profile of the player, 
and it can be printed at end of game. Any prob- 
abilities far from .5 indicate predictable behavior in 
the corresponding situations. The profiles can be 
compared over time, or used to study strategy dif- 
ferences between people. They can also be compared 
with random profiles developed by playing games 
with random input such as coin flips, or (more easily) 
by modifying the program so that BASIC statements 
replace the human player and make guesses ran- 
domly (or by some other rule). In fact, different algo- 
rithms could play each other. 

This particular implementation has two para- 
meters:a memory factor(F1) which controls the decay 
rate of old learning when it is overridden by recent 
experience, and a randomness factor (F2) influencing 
the program's likelihood of making the decision sug- 
gested by the probability estimate. These are just 
two of innumerable optional parameters which could 
be used in programming FLIP. 

The program and description were written by John S. 
James. They originally appeared in Creative Computing, 
Mar/Apr 1977.

Four in A Row 





In this game, eight pegs are put ina 
row, each one of which can hold eight 
rings. Each ring is marked with either 
an X or an O. You and an opponent 
alternate turns; in this case the oppo- 
nent is the computer. On each turn you 
place a ring over one of the pegs, one 
through eight. The object is to get four 
X's or O's in a row, vertically, horizon- 
tally or diagonally. A glance at the 
sample run will show you how this 
process works. 

While the computer already plays 
rather well, you may wish to experi- 
ment with improving the computer's 
play by changing the values in the data 
statements in lines 120 and 130. The 
first four values are awarded if a 
position yields one, two, three, or four 
ina row respectively, for the computer. 
The next four values are bonus points 
for making one, two, three, or fourina 
row in more than one direction with the 
same move. The next eight values (line 


130) are dealt with in the same way for 
the human player; thus, these values 
are for defense. 

The computer version of the game 
was written by James L. Murphy.

This program very toosely 
represents a battlefield in which you, 
the player, are located at point 0,0. 
There are five enemy installations that 
may be located anywhere from 0,0 to 
30,30 except for aclear zone from0,0 to 
10,10. The accompanying diagram 
should make this clear. Instead of the 
normal artillery type of game where 
you are lobbing projectiles onto your 
enemy installations, in this game you 
are firing some sort of laser missile ina 
very straight path which destroys 
everything in its path. If the missile flies 
within one unit either northwest or 
southeast of the target, or, of course, 
over the target directly, that target is 
destroyed. If itis within two units of the 
target, the missile will be shot down 
and that target will relocate to a new 
position one unit away from its 
previous position in some random 
direction. 

Geowar is largely a guessing game 
with incomplete information given in 
its clues. Nevertheless it’s fun to play 
and is a nice switch from just a plain 
“guess the mystery number game.” It 
was written by Gary Lorenc and origi- 
nally appeared in Creative Computing. 
May/June 1975.

Grand Prix 





In this program, you are attempting 
to complete one lap around a grand 
prix circuit against one of six op- 
ponents, everything from a US Postal 
delivery truck to a 1974 Ferrari. The 
track consists of four straightaways 
and four curves with different max- 
imum speeds possible for each one. 
Depending on which car you select for 
your own, you can take these curves 
and straights at different speeds. Also, 
the car you select will have different 
braking characteristics which may 


allow you to head into a curve at a 
higher speed and then apply the brakes 
at the last minute. 

It may sound like it’s easy to win by 
simply selecting a Porsche or Ferrari 
for your car and racing against a US 
Mail truck or a_ well-used Ford 
Mustang, but beware, it isn’t really that 
easy. 

The origin of this game is a bit hazy. 
The only thing that identifies it is PUC. 
Could this be Pacific Union College? 
Perhaps, but we're not really sure.

Guess-it 





Many, if not most, two person games 
that are played on a computer are 
based on fixed rules that assure that if 
one player uses these rules and a 
rational playing strategy then that 
player wins. If both players use these 
rules and rational playing strategies 
then the winner is usually determined 
by who goes first. Tic-Tac-Toe, Batnum 
and Even are examples of games of this 
type. 

A more interesting type of game is 
one where the playing strategy is of 
mixed type. This means that the best 
move, in most cases, depends on what 
moves have already been made and a 
player can only’ determine’ the 
probability of the best move. Standard 
card games (Bridge, Poker etc.) are 
usually games of mixed type. 

Most two person games of mixed 
type are either so complicated that the 
best strategies are not known or they 
are so simple that they are not in- 
teresting to play. The game of Guess+t 
is an exception to this pattern. The 
element of biuffing, which plays a 
central role in this game, makes the 
game interesting. The optimal strategy 
for playing this two person game of 


mixed type has been determined by 
Rufus Ilsaacs?. 

This program simulates the game of 
Guess-lIt. The computer plays accord- 
ding to the optimal strategy deter- 
mined by Isaacs. Lines 1740 to 1930 
give instructions on how to play the 
game. The number of numbers in each 
hand is determined in line 70. (It is set 
at 5. This is the value Isaacs used in his 
analysis of the game.) To change the 
number of numbers in each hand only 
the value of H in line 70 needs to be 
changed. 

To play the game in an optimal way 
decisions need to be made based on 
the win probabilities P(m,n) where mis 
the number of numbers in your hand 
and nis the number of numbers in your 
opponents hand. The matrix of these 
win probabilities is computed in lines 
80 to 180. 

To match the optimal strategy of the 
computer some type of randomizing 
device based on the win probabilities 
P(m,n) is required. (See (1) and (2) for 
descriptions of how to make and use 
such devices. These devices only work 
when there is a maximum of 5 numbers 
in each hand.) 


The decision as to whether or not a 
number asked about by a player was a 
bluff is made in line 750. The decision 
to bluff or not when asking about a 
number is made in line 940. 

The program gives the player the 
option of going first. The win probabili- 
ty, P(5,5), in this case is .538. Therefore 
the player going first has a slightly 
better than even chance of winning 
assuming that both players use the 
optimal strategy. 

There are two reasons why bluffing is 
important in any strategy. If a player 
never bluffs, then any “ask” about a 
number that is not in the opponent's 
hand will result in a loss since the other 
player will know that it must be the 
down number. A successful bluff can 
lead the other player to make an 
incorrect guess of the down number. 

The program and description were 
written by Gerard Kiernan of Manhat- 
tanville College, Purchase, NY.

Your radar station picks up an enemy ICBM heading 
your way, telling you its coordinates (in miles north and 
miles east of your location). You launch a surface-to-air 
missile (SAM) to intercept it. 

Your only control over the SAM is that you can aim it 
in any direction, both at launch, and in mid-air. Using the 
coordinates of the ICBM as a guide, you INPUT the 
direction (measured CCW from North) in which you want 
the SAM to travel. WAS spe Yan 

At the next radar scan one minute later, you are given 
the new coordinates of the ICBM, the coordinates of your 
SAM, and the distance between the two. You can now 
make corrections in the course of your SAM by entering a 
new direction. 

You have no control over the altitude of your SAM, as 
it is assumed that it will seek the same altitude as the ICBM. 

As the two missiles draw closer, you make adjustments 
in the direction of the SAM so as to intercept the ICBM. 
It's not easy to hit, because the ICBM is programmed to 
make evasive maneuvers, by taking random deviations from 
the straight line course to your location. Also, its speed ts 
not known, although it does not vary after being randomly 
selected at the start of the run. 

You can destroy the ICBM by coming within 5 miles of 
it, at which time your SAM’s heat-seeking sensors will 
come into action and direct it to its target. 1f you overshoot

the ICBM it's possible to turn the SAM around and chase 
the 1|CBM back towards your tocation. But be careful; you 
may get both missiles in your lap. 

There ts also some element of chance involved, as 
several accidents have been programmed to occur random- 
ly. These can work for you or against you. 

Some ways to improve and expand the program are: 

1. Operator control over SAM speed: In the present 
version the speed of the SAM is randomly selected by the 
computer at the start of the run, and remains constant 
thereafter. This often results in overshooting the ICBM. 
Modify the program so that you can input a new speed 
(within fimits) at the same time you input the new 
direction. 

2. Three dimensional version: Have the computer print 
the a/titude of the ICBM, as well as its coordinates. The 
operator will then have to INPUT the angle his SAM is to 
make with the horizontal, when entering the other quanti- 
ties. 

3. Extend to al! Quadrants. In the present version, the 
ICBM approaches only from the Northeast. You can 
expand this to include approach from any compass direc- 
tion. 

This game is derived from a program submitted by Chris 
Falco. The writeup is by Paul Calter and originally appeared 
in Creative Computing, May/Jun 1975.

INKBLOT is a program that creates 
“inkblots” similar to those used in the 
famous Rorschach Inkblot Test. The 
program generates these _ inkblots 
randomly so that literally millions of 
different patterns can be produced. 
Many of these patterns are quite 
interesting and serve not only as 
conversation pieces, but also as good 
examples of computer “art.” 

In addition, INKBLOT is interesting 


INKBLOT could be enhanced in 
several ways, for example allowing the 
user to specify which character is tobe 
used in printing the inkbliot. It could 
have an option to print the “negative” of 
an inkblot by filling in the area around 
the ellipses rather than the ellipses 
themselves. Finally, it is possible to 
build in a “repeatable randomness” 
feature so that exceptional outputs 
could be reproduced at any time. 
These enhancements are left for the 


[ (x-j)cos® + (y-k)sin@]? 


from a mathematical point of view. This 
is because INKBLOT actually creates 
inkblots by plotting ellipses on the left 
side of the page and their mirror- 
images on the right side. The program 
first chooses the ellipses to be plotted 
by randomly selecting the values a, b, j, 
k and @ in the equation for a rotated 
ellipse: 


a? b? 


Pod 
a 


ae 
oe a ae 





where a = the horizontal radius of the 
ellipse 
b =the vertical radius of the 
ellipse 
= the distance from the ellipse 
center to the y-axis 
k = the distance from the ellipse 
center to the x-axis 
Q@=the angle of rotation in 
radians 


Since the actual method by which the 
program plots the ellipses is quite 
complicated, it won't be discussed 
here.

In this program you are a medieval 
knight in a jousting tournament. The 
prize to the winner of the tournament is 
the princess’ hand in marriage. To win 
you must beat four other knights, the 
cng knight, the silver knight, the red 


knight, and the fierce black knight. On 
each pass of your opponent you must 
selact one of eight different aiming 
points, such as the helm, lower left, 
face of shield, et cetera, and, based on 
your aiming point, you may select from 
thrde to six different defense positions 
such as a right lean or shield low. 

As you proceed in the jousting 
tournament there are different in- 
termediate outcomes such as getting 
knocked on the shield, breaking, a 
spear, and so on. There are also some 
outcomes which end the contest such 
as your getting killed, or getting 
knocked from your horse. 

This program was conceived and 
written by Alan Yarbrough.

Jumping balls is a solitaire board 
game played with a board having nine 
holes in a line that can be filled with 
four white balls to the right end and 
four black balls to the left end. Without 
a board, it can be played with coins or 
chips. The object of the game is to 
reverse the position of the balls (or 
other objects) from one end of the 
board to the other. 

You may make a move by moving a 
ball to the immediately adjacent empty 
hole or by jumping one other ball. You 
may not jump two or more balls. Holes 
are numbered from left to right. At the 
beginning of the game, hole number 
five is free. Consequently, a legitimate 
first move would be six to five, four to

L Game 





The L-game is a 2-player strategic 
game played on a 4x4 grid. It was 
Originally devised by Edward de Bono 
and appeared in the book, “The Five- 
Day Course in Thinking.” In the game, 
each player has one ‘L’ which covers 
four squares (3 high x 2 across). The 
two L's are labelled differently to avoid 
confusion. There are also two neutral 
‘boxes’ each the size of a single square 
on the grid. To play the game with the 
computer the grid positions must be 
numbered as follows:

The game 15 played with four pieces: both 


Play always begins with all the pieces 


on the board in this position: 





The object of the game is simply to 
position one’s L and the neutral boxes 
to pin the other player's L. Each move is 
a mixture of offense and defense, for 
One is not only trying to pin the other 
player's L, but also trying to prevent his 
own L from being pinned. 


Either player may move first. To 
move, one must pick up his L and move 
it to a different position on the board. 
The player may flip his L over, rotate it 
90 degrees, etc. The L must not cover 
any other pieces or hang off the edge of 
the board. If a player is unable to move 
his L, or simply cannot find a move, he 
loses the game. Once the player has 
successfully moved his L to a new 
position on the board, he then has the 
option of moving the neutral boxes. He 
may move the boxes only to unoc- 
cupied positions and he has the option 
of moving one box, both boxes, or 
leaving the boxes where they are. By 
using the boxes effectively, one can 
block off moves for the other player’s L 
and possibly pin him. After the player 
moves the boxes (or decides not to 
move one or both) it is the other 
player's turn and play continues in the 
same manner. 

The computer version of the L Game 
was written by Bill Gardner.

This program is a life-expectancy 
test derived from Peter Passell's book 
“How To.” The test asks you a series of 
questions dealing with your life-style 
and environment. At the end of the 
questioning, the program gives your 
estimated life-expectancy and the 
percentage of the population you 
should outlive. 

You may wish to experiment with 
certain variables to see what effect they 
will have on your lifespan. It’s unlikely 
that you want to change your sex, but 
you may wish to check out the effect of 
smoking, drinking, mental attitude or 
weight. 

This program was written by John E. 
Rogers.

Lissajous 





This program prints Lissajous 
patterns. You enter relative X and Y 
frequencies and the Y phase of pi. The 
relative frequencies for X and Y must be 
a positive number one or greater. The 
phase may be between zero and any 
number you want. 

We have experimented with a wide 
range of relative frequencies and 
phases and come up with some 
startlingly beautiful patterns. Some are 
starkly plain while others are amazing- 
ly complex. If the frequencies go much 
beyond nine or ten, the patterns 
generally become jumbled and difficult 
to decipher particularly if they are 
being printed out on the normal hard 
copy terminal. Nevertheless, it’s fun to 
experiment. 

This program was originally written 
by Larry Ruane and modified by 
several other people along the line. It 
appeared first in Creative Computing, 
Sep/Oct 1977.

Magic Square

column and diagonal totals 15. GAME OF MAGIC SQUARE

Man-Eating Rabbit 








In this game you are in a pit with a 
man-eating rabbit. The center of the 
pit, appropriately enough, is at 0,0, and 
it has a radius of ten. On each move, 
you can move in any one of eight 
different angles, 0, 45, 90, 135... etc. 
Unlike you, the rabbit can take more 
than one hop on a move. The object of 
the game is to avoid the rabbit for ten 
moves. If you do this successfully you'll 
be released and set free. 

We're not sure what race of people 
on what planet dreamed up this 
diabolical sport, but we've found that 
it's extremely difficult to get away from 
the rabbit in more than about one out of 
ten games. You may, therefore, want to 
improve the odds somewhat by limiting 
the number of moves the rabbit can 
make on each turn to one or two. You'll 
find it interesting to graph the results of 
the program as you go along. To do 
this, you'll need a piece of quadrille 
paper at least 21 squares in each 
direction. Draw a circle with your 
compass ten units in diameter and then 
number the grid from minus ten to plus 
ten along the X and Y axes. Plot your 
moves as you go along and you'll see 
some interesting patterns develop. 

This program was conceived and 
written by Philip Stanway.

Mastermind 








The original invention of Mastermind is credited to an 
amateur mathematician, Mordechai Meirovich, who first 
displayed it at the 1971 Nurenburg Toy Fair.* Rights to the 
game were bought by Invicta who had moderate success 
with the game for 2% years until the Christmas season of 
1975 when it was the most popular packaged game. Sales 
surpassed even the old standby, Monopoly. 

In its most basic form, Mastermind consists of a plastic 
game board, a dozen or so pegs which can be grouped into 
six basic colors, and two groups of black and white key pegs 
(sometimes called “inference pegs’’.) The game board 
resembles the figure below. 


key-peg slots 


(total of 10 frames) 





The game is played by two people, whom we shall 
designate as the ‘active’ player and the ‘‘passive”’ player. 
The first step before play actually commences is to have the 
passive player (in our case, the computer) choose a total of 
four colored pegs at random from any of the six basic color 
groups (duplicate colors allowed, of course.) He then 
conceals these colors from the active player by placing the 
four pegs in the ‘hidden code’ ‘portion of the game board. It 
is now up to the active player to determine, in ten moves or 
less, the exact color and location of each of the four pegs 
comprising the hidden code. 

To aid the active player in determining the hidden code, 
the passive player must award the active player a number of 
key pegs (inference pegs) after each guess, according to the 
following scheme: for each peg in the active player's 
current guess which corresponds exactly (in color and posi- 


"Ed. Note— 

To anyone familiar with children’s games, it is obvious that Mastermind is 
simply a commercial adaptation (using colors rather than numbers) of the 
game Bulls and Cows. This game, much more popular in England than the 
US. is not, to my knowledge, commercially packaged. —DHA 


active player's guesses 


tion) to a peg in the hidden code, the passive person places 
one black peg in the key-peg square adjacent to the passive 
player's current guess frame. Placing of the key pegs within 
the square is arbitrary since the relative position of the key 
peg carries no meaning. Clearly, when four black pegs are 
obtained, the hidden code is broken. 

Secondly, the passive player must place one white key 
peg in the current key-peg square for each peg in the active 
player's current guess which matches (in color, but not 
position) a peg in the hidden code. Keep in mind that once a 
color peg in the player's current guess has been awarded a 
key peg, its function in determining the remaining number 
of key pegs to award for the current guess is finished. For 
example, suppose the hidden code were: 


R B Y G 


corresponding to red, blue, yellow, green, and the active 
player's current guess were: 


G B BP 


corresponding to green, blue, blue and purple. 

The passive player should subsequently award one black 
and one white key peg for the following reasons: the blue 
color peg in position 2 of the current guess matches exactly 
in color and position with the hidden code. Secondly, the 
green color peg in position 1 of the current guess matches 
the color of the peg in position 4 of the hidden code. But 
since the /ocation of the green peg is not exact, only a white 
peg is awarded. The blue and purple pegs in positions 3 and 
4, respectively, of the current guess do not match either the 
color or position of the remaining pegs in the hidden code 
(positions 1 and 3) and hence, no other key pegs are 
awarded. 

Ine game proceeds in this manner until the hidden code is 
broken or all ten frames have been filled. As noted earlier, 
the computer will play the passive player in our computer 
version, generating a hidden code and awarding the black 
and white key pegs after each guess. 

The program offers the user two options, QUIT and 
BOARD, which may be entered at any time after the first 
move. QUIT instructs the program that you are fed up with 
playing Mastermind for the time being and wish to 
terminate the session. BOARD instructs the program to 
print out a summary of the moves prior to the time that the 
BOARD command was issued, including the guesses and 
key pegs awarded for each frame. Some players find that an 
arrangement of frames such as that provided by BOARD is 
easier to visualize and subsequently analyze. Beginners 
will find it most useful. 

The program and this description were written by David 
G. Struble of the University of Dayton. It first appeared in 
Creative Computing, Mar/Apr 1976.

Masterbagels 





This is a_ fascinating, general- 
purpose, deductive logic game. It rolls 
Bagels, Mastermind, bulls and cows, et 
cetera, into one general deductive 
logic game. If you want to play Bagels, 
set the inputs to N,3,9 (N is the number 
of games you wish to play). If you want 
to play mastermind, set the inputs to 
N,4,6. Of course, many of the games 
that it plays are entirely new altogether 
such as N,7,4 or N,5,5. 

To make it into a really general- 
purpose game, you might want to putin 
a modification in the digit selection 


parameter that either allows or dis- 
allows duplicate digits. As it is right 
now, the game does allow duplicate 
digits so that, for example, it could 
select a three digit number such as 223 
or even 444. Another change you might 
want to add is in statement 750; it sets 
the maximum allowable trials for 
getting the answer. You may find that it 
is not giving you enough tries and you 
might want to increase the value of I.

Hamilton and originally appeared in

Matpuzzie 





Ready to try something new? A game 
that isn’t like STARTREK or Slot 
Machine? Then try MATPUZLE and 
enjoy the art of puzzie-making. 

One benefit of puzzies is that they 
help develop a pattern of logic in one’s 
thinking. In this puzzle you are given a 
matrix of letters, up to 6x6, and a 
board with dashes and a number above 
each of the dashes. 

The matrix represents the letters of 
the words you typed in, each having the 
same length. The number of words and 
the length of the words are both limited 
to six, six words each six letters in 
length, but, both values don’t have to 
be the same. The letters are then put in 
a matrix and randomly rearranged in 
lines 160-430. 

The dashes on the board form the 
places for each letter of each word to 
be written in after it has been 
deciphered. The number above each 
dash, determined in lines 500-780, is 
the sum of the coordinates of where the 
letter of that dash is located in the 
matrix. The problem in soiving the 
puzzie is that several coordinates have 
the same sum. 

Since the answers appear above the 
puzzle itself, rip them off before you 
give it to a friend to try. They willhavea 
great time trying to figure out your 
puzzie. Then let them make one for you 
or set up a relay. The possibilities are 
almost endless. 

The program and description were 
written by Dave Schroeder.

This is actually a two part game. In 
the first part, the program generates a 
maze which you can then try to find 
your way through with pencil and 
paper. Each path of the maze is three 
characters wide, hence the maximum 
width that will print on a standard 
seventy-two column width teletype or 
other hard copy printer is 24 for the 
horizontal dimension. A 132-column 
line printer could handle up to a hori- 
zontal dimension of 44. Naturally the 
vertical dimension can be anything 
since it’s running the length of the 
paper. However, for really large mazes 
your computer system will probably be 
the limiting factor since several 
matrices are dimensioned with the 
horizontal and vertical dimensions of 
the maze. 

In the second part of the program a 
near-sighted mouse is let loose in the 
maze and explores until he finds his 
way through. If you want to know what 
near-sighted means, run the program 
and ask to see the solution step by step 
as the mouse goes through the maze. If 
you elect not to see each step, you'll 
simply get a total solution for the maze 
itself. 

With or without the mouse, it’s a fun 
program and the larger mazes are 
frequently a real challenge to solve. 

This program was conceived and 
written by Richard Schaal.

In this game, the computer takes you 
through your life from birth to death. 
Along the way, you're asked to make 
some petty and some other rather 
crucial decisions. Some of these 
decisions regard what kind of job you 
want, how much you bet in Las Vegas, 
whether you buy a valuable coin, 
whether you elect to take a vacation or 
a second job, stock purchases— 
buying and selling, automobile ac- 
cidents, tornadoes, and the like. 

At the end of your life (it goes by ina 
flash!) the computer tallies up your 
gains and your losses and tells you 
where you Stand relative to becominga 
millionaire. In ten plays of the game, 
the most we ever got was $379,000, 
somewhat short of being a millionaire, 
but probably, all things considered, 
more realistic. 

Millionaire was conceived and 
written by Craig Gunnett, a dreamer to 
the very end.

Minotaur 








In this game, you are in a three level 
cavern. Inside the cavern are ten pillars 
which stretch through all three levels; 
they're electrified so that if you touch 
them you are immediately vaporized. 
Furthermore, there are trap doors 
which appear randomly and drop you 
down one level. The top level is three, 
the second level down is two, the first 
or lowest level is one. If a trap door 
appears in level one you are dropped 
into a bottomless pit and that ends the 
game. The minotaur itself also poses a 
hazard. If you wound him with your 
spear, he will charge you. Also, he 
randomly charges for no reason at all. 
However, he only charges in a straight 
line. Hint: keep ata slight diagonal from 
the minotaur until you are ready to 
throw your spear at him and you havea 
better chance of avoiding his charges. 
If you ask for amap, the axes are drawn 
in with X’s. This does not indicate a 
barrier or fence; you are free to move 
across the X and Y coordinate planes. 
However, you are advised not to move 
out of any of the four edges as this 
represents yet a different form of 
bottomless pit and also ends the game. 
There are many, many additional 
hazards which are not shown in the 
sample run. Try it, and be surprised! 

This program was conceived and 
written by Pete Klausler.

Motorcycle Jump 





This program, originally titled EVILK 
permits you to act out your fantasies of 
being a motorcycle daredevil! The 
game is a simple motorcycle jump over 
several busses, which takes into ac- 
count both gravity and drag forces. The 
ramp angle and motorcycle speed 
determine the distance jumped. Note 
that the injury penalty is greater for 
long jumps than for short ones, and 
that there is a chance for a crash even 
on a jump of the right length. This 
probability, initially set at .20, can be 
modified in line 560 to make survival 
more or less likely. 

This program was written by Charles 
Aylworth and originally appeared in 
Creative Computing, Jul/Aug 1978.

“Gramma Nomad” is a person who 
doesn't really know where she wants to 
live, so she moves to a new house every 
game. Then she sends you a telegram 
asking you to visit her. The object of the 
game is to successfully navigate your 
way through the streets of Garbonzo 
City to Gramma’s house. See the game 
for more details. A map of Garbonzo 
City is provided for your reference. 

Nomad was written by Steve Trapp 
and first appeared in Creative Com-

Not One 





The game, Not One, sometimes 
known as Pig, is played with two 
players and a pair of dice. There are ten 
rounds in the game; one round con- 
sisting of one turn for each player. 
Players add the score that they attain 
on each round and the player with the 
highest score after ten rounds is the 
winner. 

On each turn, the player may roll the 
two dice from one to as many times as 
he wishes. If the total of the dice on any 
roll after the first equals the total shown 
on the first roll, his score is then zero 
for that entire turn and the dice pass to 
the other player. On the other hand, if 
the total on his dice is anything 


different from the total on the first turn, 
he continues to roll and adds the totals 
of the dice to his score. After each 
successful roll, the player can decide 
whether to roll again or stop and score 
the number of points already obtained. 

You'll find that the computer plays a 
surprisingly good game of Not One. To 
beat it, you'll need some knowledge of 
probabilities and a little bit of luck on 
your side. 

Not One was written in response to a 
challenge that appeared in the charter 
issue of Creative Computing. The 
game was written by Robert Puopolo 
and first appeared in Creative Com- 
puting, Mar/Apr 1975.

The game OBSTACLE is an obstacle 
course game played on a 9x40 grid. 
A car is represented by the character 
, the obstacles are the walls 
(represented by exclamation points 
and hyphens) and spaces are where 
the car may travel. The car may not 
pass over or occupy a wall or obstacle. 
The character ‘S’ at the upper left 
corner, indicates where the car starts 
from, |and the character in the lower 
right corner, the ‘F’, is the space the car 
must Occupy at the finish to win. If the 
car tries to occupy or pass through a 
wall the game is lost. When the car 
lands|on the space occupied by the 
character ‘F’, the car has finished the 
course, and the game is over, and a 
time is calculated. 

Line-by-line, here’s how the program 
works: 

Line 610 dimensions the matrix M for 
15 rows by 50 columns (allowing an 
adequate margin for modification). 

Line 620-680 initializes all necessary 
variables. 

Line 700-780, through the use of a 
random number generator, generates 
the obstacle course, where | is the row 
matrix index and J is the column matrix 
index |and R1 is the random number. 
Line 420 generates a random number 
between 0 and 1, multiplies it by a 
density of 1.2 (to increase density 
factor| by a few decimal points) and 
removes everything right of the 
decimal point. R1 is now either Oor 1. If 
it is O| the matrix memory location M 
(lJ) Inside the For-Next Loop is 
assigned the value of aspace, if itis 1, it 
is assigned the value of an exclamation 
point. 

Lines 840 and 850 assign the walls to 
the course. 

Ling 890 stores the values of | and J 
into Kiand L, these act as value holders. 
After the print routine has been ex- 
ecuted, | and J are reassigned their old 
values stored in K and L at line 970. 

Linés 910-960, through use of a For- 
Next |Loop (as in the _ initialization 
course set up routine), print out the 
characters represented by values in 
matrix M, Line 930, the CHR$ Function 
turns the values of the memory location 
into their ASCII character equivalent. 

Ling 990 checks if the car has moved 
yet, by checking D1. If DI>0 then it 
skips the query option and continues 
with the main body. If DI=0 then it 
executes the option query, asking 
whether a new course, or this course or 
end the game and then executes the 
respective option. 

Line 1130 checks if D1 is not equal to 
1 and/if so continues with the move-

SPEED IS THE NO. OF SPACES IN A GIVEN DIRECTION 


ment routine. If not then it starts the car 
at matrix position 2,2 and continues 
with the movement routine. 

Line 1080 starts the main program 
body, 1100 queries the direction and 
1110 checks the input D if it is a valid 
direction. Line 1120 inputs the speed 
‘S’' and Line 1130 initializes the 
counters S1 and D1. Lines 1160-1180 


direct control to the proper movement _ 


routine (1 is up, 2 is right to left, 3 is 
down). 

Line 1190-1220 is the movement 
routine for direction 1. Line 1190 erases 
the car from the previous position 
keeping track of | and J. Line 1200 and 
1210 check each character position 
between matrix position I,J, and I-S,J 
for a wall (exclamation or hyphen); if 
one is encountered the game is over. If 
no walls are encountered, the move is 
legal and Line 1220 assigns the car to 
matrix position I-1,J and jumps to 1310 
to check matrix position 10,41 if it 
contains a car. If so, the game is won 
and the End of Run routine is executed. 
If matrix position 10,41 is not occupied 
the game is not over and control jumps 
to 870, the matrix print routine. The 
Loop can only be exited by losing 
(crashing into an obstacle) or by 
getting the car to matrix position 10,41 
where it executes the End of Run 
routine. 

Line 1380 calculates the time by 
dividing total number of turns by total 
number of character spaces covered 
by the car and multiplies it by 100. Line 
1390 prints the time and Line 1400 and 
1410 query as to whether to play the 
game again. 

The program and these notes were 
written by Eric Erickson.

STEVE’S HAND 


ee ee ee ee ee eee eee 


This is a card game for up to four 
players, or three players plus the 
computer. A deck of 32 cards is used 
with ace through eight in each of the 
four suits. All 32 of the cards are dealt 
out at the beginning of the game, eight 
to each player. On each hand, each 
player discards one card depending on 
the rules of the game (see the rules at 
the beginning of the sample game) 
either the high card discard or the low 
card discard wins that trick. After eight 
tricks a new hand is dealt and play 
Proceeds as before. Perhaps the 
easiest way to learn Octrix is to play a 
few games with you and the computer 
or with several people and the com- 
puter. Observe what happens and 
before long you'll be able to work out a 
reasonable strategy for playing the 
game. 

Octrix was written by Rogers 
Hamilton.

Description: 


This program generates artistic patterns based 
on Pascal’s triangle. 


Comments: 


Pascal’s triangle is one of the most famous 
number patterns in mathematics. The triangle is 
very easy to construct. The first two rows consist 
of only 1’s. Each of the subsequent have a 1 at 
either end of the row, but all other numbers in the 
pattern are the sum of the two numbers to the right 
and left in the row above. An example, illustrating 
the first 6 rows of the triangle, is shown below: 


146 4 1 
15 1010 51 


The program provides the user with three options 
during the course of a RUN. 

They are: 

1. A single “Pascal's triangle” 

2. Two “Pascal’s triangles” 

3. Four “Pascal's triangles” 

A user may also specify the size of the array and 
the multiples of the number to be eliminated. 

Option 1 simply allows a user to examine an 
artistic picture of the relative positions of the mul- 
tiples of any number in the array. The apex of the 
array will appear in the upper left corner of the page. 

An example of how the machine uses a “triangle” 
to create a design based on eliminating the multiples 
of two is shown below.

Option 2 allows a user to create a picture based 
on two Pascal's triangles in opposite corners of a 
Square array. An example of how the machine uses 
two Pascal's triangles in the corners of a square to 
create a design based on eliminating the multiples 
of 2 is shown below:

Option 3 creates a design based on Pascal’s 
triangles in the four corners of a square. An ex- 
ample of how the machine uses four Pascal’s tri- 
angles in the corners of an 8x8 array to create an 
artistic design based on eliminating the multiples 
of 2 is shown below.

Approximately 5 minutes of terminal time is 
required to print a design with dimensions of 36x36.

PINBALL is, naturally enough, a 
simulated pinball game—complete 
with bells if your terminal has them—in 
which the computer serves as the 
pinball machine. However, you don't 
need any quarters! The program is 
divided up into ten small routines 
contained within the whole. Each 
subprogram performs one task in 
simulating a pinball game. 

Details on each task/subprogram are 
as follows. 


1) Starting and monitoring the game. 

This task is performed by the master 
function PINBAL, which is contained in 
lines 1-600 of the program. Pinbal asks 
if the user wants instructions or a 
picture at the start of the game, puts 
each new ball into play, moves the ball 
until it comes into contact with an 
object on the table, and tells the user 
when he is finished and if he has 
broken the table record. 


2) Printing instructions. 

This subprogram is on the lines 
numbered 1010-1999, and its major 
task is to print the instructions of the 
pinball game and then to branch to the 
picture program to print a picture of the 
table (see below). After the picture of 
the table is completed, this subroutine 
explains the function of each figure on 
the table. 


3) Registering “hits” and computing 
new scores. 

Lines 2010-3999 are in charge of 
taking action each time the space 
occupied by the ball on the table is not 
blank. These lines also prepare the 
table to take action on the next task, 
namely flipping the table's flippers 
when the ball approaches them. 


4) Flipping the flippers. 

This task is accomplished by the 
lines in the four thousand range. These 
lines also set up indicators for the 
monitor routine (1 above) to put the 
next ball into play if necessary and 
branch to the routine that adds bonus 
points for tags (letters A-J) knocked 
down during that ball’s play. 


5) Bonus points at the end of a ball’s 
play. 

Lines in the five thousand range 
handle this task and then branch back 
to the monitor routine to put the next 
ball into play. If all ten tabs are knocked 
down in one ball, the program im- 
mediately awards a bonus of 250 points 
and an extra ball to the player and 
resets the tabs for further play. Normal- 
ly, bonus points are awarded at the rate 
of ten per tab at the end of a ball. 


6) Printing pictures of the table. 

Lines in the six thousand range print 
a picture of the pinball table, either at 
the beginning of play or randomly, at 
the rate of one picture for every twenty- 
five “hits.” 


7) Bouncing the ball off bumpers and 
the jackpot. 
The ball is “bounced” by the routine 
beginning at line 7850. 


8) Initializing the table. 

The table is initialized at the begin- 
ning of the game by lines in the nine 
thousand range. 


RUN 


PINBALL 


Suggestions for improvement and 

change. 

1) Change the table as you wish by 
inserting or deleting bumpers, 
jackpot(s), gates (numbers, now 1-9 
and Q), etc. You may also move the 
positions of any item on the table 
except the three flippers. 

2) Program in new sorts of table ob- 
jects. 

3) If your system is So equipped, rig in 
the program with some synthesizer 
music to heighten realism! 


Pinball was conceived and written by

Rabbit Chase 





Seemingly, the purpose of this game 
is to chase-down and catch a rabbit. 
Now this rabbit is an elusive little 
devil—it can hop randomly in any 
direction. You canrunat least as fast as 
the rabbit, maybe even faster (the 
computer will decide). You must get 
within 20 units of the rabbit to be ableto 
catch him. Before each hop, the 
computer will print out your position, 
the rabbit's position, the direction the 
rabbit is going to jump, and your 
closest approach on the last hop. You 
are to tell the computer which direction 
you wish to run. All coordinates and 
directions are aS a geometer would 
mark them on a standard Cartesian 
Coordinate System. 

In addition to being good fun, this 
game gives you practice in using and 
visualizing an x-y coordinate plane. 
After each hop, consider the output 
and try torun the right direction. Try to 
do all the figuring in your head. Using 
scratch paper is considered to be 


RUN 


RABBIT CHASE 


cheating (except for maybe the first 


time you play). 


Suggested Modifications 
1. Change the program so that you can 


choose your own speed. 


2. The game is much more challenging 
when the “capture distance” can be 
varied. A distance of 50 units is a 
cinch, 15 units may make you wish 
for scratch paper, 5 units will require 
you to use a protractor and graph 


paper. 


3. See if you can invent a way to extend 
this game to 3 dimensions! 4 dimen- 


sions! etc.! 


4.You might try limiting the total

Roadrace 


You are the driver of aracecar onthe 
notorious NY Route 20. You'll have to 
drive 5 miles with 2 gallon of gas, while 
keeping alert for changes in the road 
conditions, other cars, etc. 

At the start you pick your car and 
course. During the race you control 
braking and acceleration. 

Watch out for passing another car! If 
you try to go the same speed he’s 
going, youre going to meet a 
Greyhound bus head-on! 

The game is tough to win. | usually 
wipe out in a Curve or run Out of gas. 
You might want to increase your MPG 
rating. ..look at line 870. 

Good luck!

Rotate 





LIST 


The game of Rotate is played on a 
four-by-four board filled randomly with 
the letters A through P. In a sense it is 
like the little plastic games with sliding 
pieces bearing the numbers 1-15 or 
letters A-0. 

The object of the game is to put the 
letters in alphabetical order. This is 
done by rotating groups of four letters 
clockwise one position. The group to be 
rotated is specified by the positional 
number of the letter in the upper left- 
hand corner of the group. You are also 
given one special move which permits 
you to exchange any two adjacent

this move too early in the game; indeed, 
sometimes it’s not necessary at all, and 
since you get it only one time, once you 
use it you can't recover. Your only move 
then is to type a zero to give up.

In asense, this is another game in the 
“guess a mystery number” family. 
However, it has quite a different “twist.” 
In this game, you are trying to open a 
safe by turning or twisting a dial back 
and forth between one and ninety-nine 
or ninety-nine and one. 

The instructions shown in the sam- 
ple run are very complete. However, 
one hint that will help you when you 
start playing is that it is usually best to 
start at ninety-nine when going to the 
right because if you get a click, the 
number must be close. If not, you can 
step it down by eights or tens until you 
get the first click and then judge from 
there. 

Safe was created and written by 
Kevin Ashley. 


Turning Left g Turning Right 





NOTE: There is no spot 0 (zero) and it spins 
back past the last number automati- 
cally as in most locks.

YOU ARE A BURGULAR AND HAVE ENCOUNTERED A SAFE. YOU MUST 

OPEN THE SAFE TO GET THE SECRET PLANS THAT YOU CANE FOR. 

TO DO THIS , YOU MUST ENTER THE NUMBER OF UHAT YOU UANT THE 
DIAL TURNED TO, THE COMPUTER WILL ACT AS THE SAFE AND WILL 

HELP YOU BY GIVING A SORT OF CLUE, THAT IS YOU WILL’HEAR™ 

A CLICK AT EVENLY SPACED NOTCHES AS YOU MOVE TO THE PROPER 

NUMBER. THERE ARE FOUR OF THEN BEFORE THE FINAL CLICK IS 
“MEARD’. AFTER THE FIWAL ONE IS HEARB, YOU WILL GO ON TO 
THE WEXT MUMBER. THE COMPUTER WILL’SAY’ ‘CLICK’ FOR EACH 

NOTCH THAT YOU PASS AND ‘SeCLICKee’ WHEN YOU REACH THE 

PROPER NUMBER. IF YOU PASS IT OR TAKE LONGER THAN TEN TRIES 

ON ANY OWE WUNBER, YOU WILL ACTIVATE THE ALARA. 

REMEMBER THAT UHEW YOU TURN THE DIAL TO THE LEFT, THE

This program tests your knowledge of 
different types of musical scales. It 
generates 11 types of scales: major, 
natural minor, harmonic’ minor, 
Hungarian minor, dorian, phygian, 
lydian, mixolydian, locrian, and whole 
tone. 

Prior to running the program, test 
yourself off line on a sheet of paper by 
writing down several types of scales 
and 8 notes starting at anote chosen by 
you. Then run the program to check 
your answers. 

When you run this program, you will 
be asked, “Which type of scale is 
wanted?” Respond by typing the first 
two letters of the name of the desired 
scale followed immediately by the 
desired key. Use alower case ‘b’ forthe 
flat and use ‘#’ for the sharp. Sample in 
puts would be phe for phrygian starting 
on E, maf# for major on F-sharp, and 
whg for whole tone on G. 

The author, Marvin S. Thostenson, is 
at the School of Music, University of 
lowa. Scales first appeared in Creative 
Computing, Mar/Apr 1977.

Schmoos are imaginary creatures 
who love being splattered with juicy 
mudballs. You, being a schmoo lover, 
try to make schmoos happy by tossing 
mudballs at them. It will help you in 
playing this game to know a little bit 
about grids and angles like in the X,Y 
coordinate system 2,-3 means right 2 
and down 3. If 0 degrees is the angle 
coinciding with the positive X axis, then 
2,-3 would be in the fourth quadrant 
and would correspond to angles 
between 270 and 360 degrees. 

If you're pretty good, you can “splat 
the schmoo” in about eight tries; but 
don't cheat and use the formula. And 
don't expect me to tell you where it’s 
hidden in the program! 

If you want to extend the Schmoo 
game, you might want to add a third 
dimension with flying schmoos. The 
program shouldn't be too hard and it 
would be a really neat game. If you 
want to try something easier, fix 
Schmoo so that it requires initial 
velocities as well as angles. You could 
even make alow-gravity (lunar version) 
of Schmoo. 

Schmoo was conceived and written 
by Frederick H. Bell at the University of 
Pittsburgh. It first appeared in Creative 
Computing, Sep/Oct 1975.

Seabattie 





The object of the game of SEA 
BATTLE is quite simple. You are a 
submarine with a mission to seek out 
and destroy all of the enemy ships in 
your area, using whatever means are 
available. This includes torpedoes, 
Polaris missiles, sabotage, and suicide. 
The enemy, in turn, throws out depth 
charges in an attempt to destroy you. 
There are also some underwater mines 
which have a nasty habit of blowing 
you up when you run into them. Other 
hazards are some very hungry sea 
monsters lurking about who have a 
taste for submarine sandwiches. 

| started writing this program two 
years ago, and finished my last 
modifications just recently. Of course, 
this doesn’t mean | worked on it 
continuously for two years. There were 
some long 4-6 month stretches when | 
didn't do anything to it. It started out as 
a very simple program, and | just kept 
thinking of things to add to it. 

| am currently a senior in Simley 
Senior High School in Inver Grove 
Heights, Minnesota, and am 18 years 
old. | have been working with com- 
puters since the ninth grade, and have 
written many programs, including this 
one. 

This program always draws a crowd 
in our school computer room, even 








from kids who don’t even know which 
end of ateletype to type on. | built every 
possible inconvenience into it, to keep 
people from winning too easily. | am 
happy to say that when a person wins 
now, it’s headline news. There are 
always muttered oaths to beat the 
computer next time, and this alone 
brings me more enjoyment than play- 
ing the program. 

As you Can see, the program is quite 
long, and initially | had some storage 
problems, as I’m sure many of you will 
have, too. All | can say is to slice away 
at some of the more trivial commands 
and options until (hopefully) you cut it 
down to a reasonable size. If compiling 
space is a problem, you may have to 
divide the program into subprograms 
chained together. If you don’t have this 
capability, you'll have to brainstorm 
your own ideas. 

Here are some of the anomalies our 
HP 2000 system. Strings are dimen- 
sioned from one to 72 characters in 
length. Positions on the string are 
identified with two numbers. Ex. 
A$(2,4) A$ is the name of the string. 
The 2 tells the computer to begin the 
substring at the second character. The 
4 tells the computer to end the sub- 
string at the fourth character of A$. So, 
A$(1,1) allocates the first character of 


143 


A$. | used this for identifying ‘Y’ and ‘N’ 
in yes/no responses. 

Line 590 is an example of logical 
operation. It tells the computer that if 
the expression is nonzero, to proceed 
to the line specified. If it is zero, it will 
fall through to the next line. 

A slightly different type of logical 
operation is found in lines 3020-3050. 
In these lines the logical quantity is 
evaluated first, and if true, the quantity 
is set to 1. If itis false, itis set to0. These 
can all be taken care of with IF-THEN 
statements if necessary. 

| hope that the size of the program 
does not scare too many people away. 
It should be able to be made compati- 
ble with very little rewriting. If you have 
a few hours of free time to rewrite a 
little, it should be worth the effort. 

| tried to throw a lot of random 
statements in there to make playing the 
game more uncertain. Cutting some of 
these out may save some space, if 
that’s a problem for you. 


Note: The writeup above, by Vincent 
Erickson, refers to the original HP 
version. The one presented here is in 
Standard Microsoft Basic. Some con- 
version notes by Steve North are found 
in the listing, lines 90-230.

THIS IS THE GAME OF SEA BATTLE!!! THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO 
TESTROY ALL OF THE ENEMY SHIFS IN YOUR 20 FY 20 AREA WITH THE 

VARTOUS WEAFONS IN YOUR SUBMARINE’S ARSENAL. YOU MUST [iO THIS» 
HOWEVER, WITHOUT LETTING THE ENEMY LESTROr YOU FIRST! ! 


THERE ARE SEVERAL INTERESTING HAZARDS IN THE GAME. THEY INtCLUE: 
»- DEPTH CHARGES FROM NEARBY ENEMY SHIFS. 
VERY HUNGRY SEA MONSTERS! ! 
oe AND HINDEN UNDERWATER MINES. 


THE [EF TH CHARGES ARE EFFECTIVE TO ANY TDEFTH»s BUT THEY LOSE 

THEIR EFFECTIVNESS OVER DISTANCE» SO THE FARTHER YOU ARE FROM 
ANY SHIFS» THE HETTER! 

THE SEA MONSTERS TAKE A MEANIIERING COURSE THROUGH YfOUR AREA THAT 
MAY ERING IT CLOSE ENOUGH TO ATTACK YOU. YOU RARELY SURVIVE. 

THEY ALSO LIKE TO EAT YOUR TORFEDOS»s BUT MISSILES WILL KILL THEM. 


THE ENEMY SHIFS MOVE ON EVERY TURNe IN A FIXED COURSEs UNLESS THEY 
ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES. THEY WILL GET BLOWN UF BY MINES» ANI GET 
EATEN BY SEA MONSTERS TOO. 


fOU HAVE TEN ORTRERS THAT YOU MAY GIVE. THEY ARE; 


#0; NAVIGATION -—- THIS COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE IN A 

FARTICULAR DIRECTION AND DISTANCE ACROSS YOUR AREA. THE 

8 1 2 BDIRECTION IS DETERMINED KY THE GRAFH AT LEFT. THERE 

aed ARE 8 [TIRECTIONS TO MOVE IN» AND THEY ARE THE SAME 

7-k-3 ANYTIME YOU ARE ASKELt FOR A COURSE. FOR EXAMFLE? 

/’°N TO MOVE NORTH» YOU WOULD USE COURSE #1. THE COMFUTER 

65 4 WILL ALSO ASK FOR AN AMOUNT OF FOWER. IT TAKES 100 UNITS 
OF FOWER TO MOVE YOUR SUE 1 SFACE. KEWARE OF OKRSTACLES!! 
IF vOU USE MORE THAN 1000 UNITS IN A TURN» THERE IS AN OVERLOAL 
DANGER, SO BE VERY CAREFUL! ! 


#1: SONAR - THIS COMMANID HAS TWO OF TIONS. OFTION #1 GIVES 
QNIRECTIONAL INFORMATIONs SHOWING THE [tIRECTIONS AND FISTANCES 
IN WHICH THERE ARE ENEMY SHIFS. THIS IS USEFUL FOR SHOOTING AT LONG 
RANGES» WHERE IT IS GIFFICULT TO TELL IF A SHIF IS IN TIRECT LINE. 


OFTION #0 FRINTS OUT A MAF OF YOUR AREA IN A SQUARE. 
CIT USES SYMBOLS FOR THE MAF) ‘x’ INDICATES [iKRY LANIts ’°$’ IS

#3: FOLARIS MISSILE CONTROL - THIS COMMANT ALLOWS YOU TO 
LAUNCH ONE OF YOUR FOLARIS MISSILES AGAINST THE ENEMY. THE 
COMFUTER WILi ASK FOR A COURSE ANDI FUEL. IT TAKES 75 UBS. OF FUEL 
FO ROOST A MISSILE !t SFACE. SINCE THEY ARE SO MUCH MORE FOWERFUL» 
THEY WILL COMPLETELY [DESTROY THE SFACE THEY LANT ON»y FLUS ALL 
OF THE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT ONES. MISSILES DESTROY EVERYTHING!!! 


#4. MANUEVERING - THIS COMMANTI ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE 
DEFTH YOU’RE AT. YOU MAY WANT TO TO THIS IF YOU ARE BALLS 
LAMAGED»s BECAUSE REFAIRS GO ON TWICE AS QUICKLY RELOW 
2500 FT. ANIt AKROVE SO FT. THAN IN BETWEEN. YOU START THE GAME AT 100

You are the commander of a fleet of 
ships operating in enemy territory. 
Your task force consists of 9 ships, and 
the enemy has 9 ships. Whoever sinks 
all of the opponent's ships first wins the 
campaign. 

You, as the commander, must 
provide the angle of elevation at which 
the guns will be fired, neglecting air 
resistance. Your instruments will read 
the range to the target, and the initial 
velocity is held constant at about 675 
meters per second. 

SEAWAR will help you learn about 
the paths of projectiles and what 
happens as the angle of elevation 
varies. 


1. First, what do you think the path of 
the projectile looks like. Make a 
sketch. (If you're still not sure, do 
some research in the library—it will 
help you win the battle, com- 
mander!) 

a. What angle of elevation do you 
think will give the maximum 


range? 
b. What will happen if you fire the 
guns at 0°? 


c. What will happen to the projectile 
if you fire it straight up? 

2. After becoming proficient at winning 
the battle, change the initial velocity 
of the projectile. How does this 
affect the range? 


The original SEAWAR had a timing 
function that allowed only about 7 
seconds to make your next move. If 
your computer has a timer, this would 
be a neat addition. 

The origin of SEAWAR is unknown. It 
was revised and submitted to us by 
David S. Paxton. It was further revised 
and the writeup prepared by Mary T. 
Dobbs, Mathematics and Science 
Center, Glen Allen, Virginia. It first 
appeared in Creative Computing, 
May/Jun 1975.

The scene is some time in the near 
future. You and another individual on 
the other side of the planet are the only 
survivors of a total atomic war. (Yes, |! 
know it’s corny.) This war was fought 
totally with ground based atomic 
missiles. Both you and the surviving 
enemy have found the last missile 
bases left from each side. Fortunately 
(for me anyway), these missile grids 
are made and operated identically. 

Each player moves on and is 
restricted to a 10 by 10 missile matrix. 
Every co-ordinate on the grid cor- 
responds to a mini-missile base. At 
every base, there is a terminal tied into 
the main scanner computer, located 
safely many miles away. From each 
terminal, the player obtains informa- 
tion relevant to the current situation. 
Because of the way the missiles are 
constructed, the area left after lift-off 
is exposed to high doses of raw 
radiation and may not be occupied by 
life. The same is true of an area that has 
been struck by a missile, it is extremely 
lethal and would kill anything entering 
the vicinity. 

Due to the fact that everyone else is 
dead, all machinery must be operated 
manually. This means that the players 
must set the target co-ordinates and 
latch the fuse for the missile to be shot 
off. After that, the players must flee the 
area. This is done in a small shuttle car, 
equipped with sensor devices to avoid 
dangerous areas. But due to its limited 
power reserves, itcan go only two units 
in any direction, up, down, or diagonal- 
ly, and no more or less. The danger 
involved is that while in flight, the 
player is away from a scanner com- 
puter terminal and will not know where 
the enemy missile is aimed to land. 


in the time it takes to move to the new 
base, the missiles will be at the apex of 
their flight above the earth. There the 
computer will give out tracking infor- 
mation as to whether you hit the 
enemy, or he hit you, or both. If the 
missile is Coming down to. hit the 
player, there is no escape. The time 
required to recharge the shuttle car is 


longer than the time it takes for the 
missile to hit the ground. If either 
player is unfortunate enough to get 
trapped into a corner, the seeping 
radiation will eventually kill him. 

So it is plainly a game of kill or be 
killed. However, don't be misled into 
thinking that it is simply agame of luck, 
several different strategies may be 
applied to destroy the enemy. 


Line by line explanation. 

Lines 440-490. | assemble three 
commonly used print strings. S$ 
becomes a string of fourteen spaces. 

Lines 500-530. Here is the dimen- 
sioning of the four matrices, and the 
Start-up and circle check data. The 
matrices “I” and “H” stand for player 
and enemy playing fields (1 and HE). 
the “T” matrix is atemporary list for use 
by the enemy, and is part of the “smart” 
algorithm. It is loaded up during each 
pass with the possible places he could 
move to, or looking at the possible 
places where the player could move. 
The “P” matrix is filled with the eight 
possible co-ordinates that one may 
move to. | might say here that the 
program may be modified for a longer 
and more challenging game by chang- 
ing the data in line 530. Change all the 
twos to ones and the two players may 
move only one unit away from their 
previous position, instead of the two 
used now. 

Lines 540-730. | set up a random 
number to decide which pair of corner 
co-ordinates the enemy will be started 
in. | then proceed to set the pair from 
550 to 570. | then digress to zero my 
matrices. Picking up where | left off, 
lines 640 to 680 peel away any unused, 
but unwanted data, keying on the 
unique first number of the last pair. 
From there the remaining data is 
dumped into “P.” 

Lines 740-820. Make the report that 
the enemy has been “fooling around.” 
The starting co-ordinates for the player 
are then obtained and checked. From 
there the valid loop switch is set, amap 
is printed, and the program is thrust 
headlong into the main routine. 


153 


Lines 830-920. Here the co-ordinates 
for the missile and the new spot to sit 
on are obtained and verified of their 
validity. 

Lines 930-1080. “Enemy” decides 
where player might be going from last 
position, and aims his missile in that 
direction. 

Lines 1090-1280. The “enemy” looks 
for place to go. If he has cornered 
himself, say so, prepare him for his 
execution, and make it look like he 
hasn't fired a missile. Otherwise, he 
chooses a new co-ordinate to rest 
upon. 

Lines 1290-1480. Now we move 
everyone around (where we can), and 
start to find out who got who, if anyone 
at all. Then from 1430-1480 there is a 
check to discover whether the player 
has a place to go or not. If not, another 
message is printed and player will die 
quietly after output. 

Lines 1490-1780. Here the printing of 
the two matrices is done. A value of one 
or zero is tested for making the proper 
symbol. After the output is complete 
“Z” is checked to see if anyone died on 
the way. If no one had, return for 
another pass, else terminate the 
program. 


| spent a lot of time debugging this 
program. After | finally got it to work, | 
found that it became somewhat addic- 
tive. The tension does seem to build 
when the game reaches the final 
possible moves. | found there are two 
different useful strategies that may be 
applied. 

My favorite is building a fence around 
the enemy with missile shots. The idea 
is to cut off his movements while trying 
to keep out of his way. The other 
method is the one the enemy uses. 
Here the player shoots at where he 
thinks the opponent may be each time. 
Quite often the game is ended early, 
the odds of being hit become too great. 

Any method you use, or another you 
may think of, will lend long hours of 
enjoyment. Have fun! 

The program and description were 
written by David Spencer.

Strike 9 


This is a simple game based on the 
numbers 1 through9, and a pair of dice. 
First, the computer rolls a random 
number for your “dice.” Then you must 
take that number from the total of your 
board numbers 1-9. To win you must 
remove all of your board numbers. With 
each roll you must remove the total 
number of that roll from the board or 
you lose. 

One strategy is to remove the largest 
numbers possible with each roll, or you 
can try to get the most numbers 
removed. For example, if the roll is 10, 
you might want to remove the 1, 2, 3 
and 4 instead of the 1 and 9. 

You may want to have competition 
and players can alternate with rolls. 
Then the player who can't remove all 
numbers from his/her roll loses. 

Strike 9 was conceived by Bruce 
Grembowski and first appeared in 
Creative Computing, Jan/Feb 1977.

This program inputs a line of 
characters from a Teletype, and then 
punches the shape of each letter on 
paper tape. This program can handle 
all of the letters and numbers and the 
space, but there is no reason why it 
could not be modified to handle 
various symbols also. 

The operation of this program is 
fairly straightforward. After each 
character is converted to a number 
equivalent to its place in the alphabet 
(A=1, B=2, Z=26, space=27), a simple 
table look-up is performed to find the 
correct numbers to punch onto the 
tape. These numbers are stored in the 
DATA statements. 

The original program was designed 
for a PDP-8; the one here runs in 
Microsoft Basic, however it would not 
be difficult to modify the program for 
virtually any Basic-speaking computer. 

Written by Bill Gardner and Jim 
Larus, Tickertape first appeared in 
Creative Computing, May/Jun 1977.

TV Pilot 


This program automatically devises 
plots for television shows or series 
guaranteed to appeal to the masses 
and win high Nielsen ratings. By 
substituting appropriate words in the 
various parts of the program it could be 
easily modified for many other useful 
purposes such as devising names for 
new breakfast cereals, preparing PhD 
theses, or naming government agen- 
cies and their corresponding projects. 

This program was originally written 
in FOCAL by Mary Cole and converted 
to BASIC by David Anhl.

The computer will set up a 15x15 playing field in which 
you are randomly located. Also inside the field is an 
objective square, 30 blocked squares (walls), 22 relocation 
squares, and 1 super special new maze square, and, of 
course, the Twonky (which is no relation to a creme-filled 
cupcake). 

To win the game, you must reach the objective square 
before the Twonky gets you, by moving one square at atime, 
forward, backward, right or left. Unfortunately, you are 
hindered by several things: 

RELOCATION squares, when moved on, cause you to be 
randomly transported to another position in the maze. 

WALLS; you can't move into these squares, and lose your 
turn when you hit one. 

SUPER-MAZE-SQUARE; essentially an instant loss, 
since when you move here acompletely new maze is set up. 

TWONKY; after every move, the Twonky moves toward 
you. (He ts impervious to all traps, even walls). When he 
gets too close to you (2 or fewer squares), you tose. 
However, you are equipped with a de-materializing ray gun. 
You have the option of using this on your turn. If you hit the 
Twonky he de-materializes and then re-materializes on a 
different square of the maze to resume his quest after you. 
(CAUTION: he could be dropped into your lap!). 

After each move pair (you and Twonky), your distance 
from both the Twonky and the objective square are printed. 
There is no board printout — you play blind. However, using 
the distances, you can home in to the approximate position 
of both Twonky and objective. 

When shooting at the Twonky, you do not have a shot if 
the distance he is from you is not an integer. For example: If 
the Twonky its 2.23606 units away, you don’t have a direct 
shot. If he is 4 units away, you do have a shot. Exceptions to 
this rule are distances of 5, 10, 13, and 17. (A review of the 
Pythagorean Theorem will show why this is true.) Hence, if 
the distance is 5, 10, or 13 (but not 17), you may or may not 
have a direct shot. Likewise, this set of rules applies to the 
direction of the objective. 

If you watch your distances before and after moving, you 
should be able to tell where the Twonky is in relation to you, 
e.g., forward and to the right, or backward and to the left. 
Take the distance you are from the Twonky, square it, say 
2.236062 = 4.999998 approx. = 5. Then find two integers 
that when squared and added together equal this (2 and 1). 
If the Twonky is forward and to the right, you now know that 
he is either up 2, over 1, or up 1, over 2. 

The thing that makes Twonky unique, is that it can be 
played on two levels, one in which you play for fun, moving 
haphazardly; or you can play while figuring out exact 
positions, and calculating moves in advance for a challeng- 
ing (as well as fun) game. 

Twonky was written by Mark Capella and first appeared in 
Creative Computing, May/Jun 1977.

ITS KING (KONG: THEIR KING IS KING KONG) HAS 
CAPTURED YOU. HE WAS PUT YOU IN A MAZE THAT IS 

15 © 15 UNITS LONG. YOU ARE IN THE DARK AND CANNOT 
SEE... YOU MUST GET TO THE OBJECTIVE SQUARE AND 

BE SET FREE. 


HAZARDS INCLUDE: 
SQUARES THAT YOU CANNOT GO INTO (30). 
SQUARES THAT RANDOMLY THROW YOU AROUND THE MAZE (22). 
SQUARE THAT SETS UP A NEW MAZE AND ALL THAT’S IW IT (1) 
MONSTER CALLED TUOQWKY THAT CHASES YOU AWD WILL 

ABSORB YOU IF THE DISTANCE IT IS FROM YOU FALLS 

BELOW 2 UNITS. . 

TWONKY IS ALSO IMAUNE TO ALL TRAPS INCLUDING 

WALLS.

Two-to-Ten 





Two-to-Ten is a game of chance 
played with aspecial deck of cards with 
only the cards 2-10. The game is similar 
to blackjack in that you are drawing 
cards and trying to come as close as 
possible to a goal number (chosen at 
random before each round) without 
going over it. You must come within a 
certain number of points of the goal 
number determined by a “lucky-limit” 
card. The catch to the game is that you 
are not given the exact value of the goal 
number but rather a clue that is only 
within 15% of the goal. 

Can you think of a way to make Two- 
to-Ten more interesting? Perhaps play- 
ing it against the computer as an 
opponent? 

Two-to-Ten appeared in Creative 
Computing, Nov/Dec 1976.

UFO is a strategy game in which you 
play against the computer in a life-and- 
death struggle for superiority of space. 
It takes place after a space war with 
another planet in which both earth and 
the attacker's planet are destroyed. 
Both planets—basically similar in 
strength, social structure, and scientif- 
ic awareness—realizing they are 
doomed, launch a “lifeboat” intospace. 
The lifeboats are equally armed and 
powered. 

However, the aliens are much better 
marksmen, hitting once out of every 
two shots (in lines 880-890, the 
computer's odds are set). The reason is 
as follows. The enemy ship's decisionis 
made by the program; the enemy will 
only retreat if he feels you are ramming 
and will approach only if you are 
running and/or his fuel is running out 
(smaller weaponry eats up less fuel). He 
will only use option 6 (no move but 
gains fuel) if his energy is below a 
certain point. In other words, you can 
think, while he cannot. You have the 
advantage of your mind, sothe alien has 
been given the advantage of a good 
steady aim. 

The game is set in the future: civiliza- 
tion is destroyed, 150 people are left, 
and you are in command. The enemy 
has never truly been seen, as many 
enemies are never truly seen, but never- 
theless you must destroy him or be 
destroyed. Your weapons are ex- 
plained and the game begins. In your 
command ship is a control which will 
not allow you to make an illegal move. 
This control waits after you fire for the 
shot to reach the other ship and for the 
explosion reports to reach the ship. It 
then gives a full report of power drain of 
both ships. If your power is not nega- 
tive you are still in the game but onceit 
drops below zero your crew dies (the 
energy level is the amount of energy left 
to counteract the attack. If moreenergy 
hits the ship than was repulsed, theship 
is destroyed. If the amounts are equal 
then the ship had exactly the same 
amount of energy as the attack 
drained.) If in any game you can get 
close enough to your enemy touse your 
heavy guns without frightening off the 
enemy (5000-11000), the game will last 
for quite a long time. Theoretically this 
game will last forever if played logically.

Under & Over 














This is a funny little dice game in 
which you're betting on the outcome of 
rolling two dice. You may bet on any 
number from two to twelve. If your 
number is exactly the same as shown 
on the sum of the dice, you win at four 
to one odds. If your number is under 
seven and the roll of the dice is under 
seven, yOu win even money. If your 
number is over seven and the roll of the 
dice is over seven, you also win even 
money. Only a bet on seven itself can 
win at four to one. The program goes 
on until you run out of money or until 
you interrupt it.

Werd Search Puzzie 


This program generates the im- 
mensely popular word-search puzzles 
containing names of Presidents, states, 
types of animals, fish, and every 
manner of objects. It asks you the 
length and width of the puzzle you wish 
generated and then the number of 
words to be hidden in the puzzle. As the 
instructions note, occasionally the com- 
puter may find that it can’t hide a 
particular word in the puzzle and will 
ask you if it should start over or if you 
want that particular word deleted. If 
you start over, try giving it fewer words 
or larger puzzle dimensions. The 
program hides the words fairly ef- 
ficiently although you can_ usually 
improve on it slightly when you get the 
final puzzle out. Since you're probably 
just using this program for fun, it’s 
generally more than adequate. 

This word search puzzle generator 
was originated by Leor Zolman.

THIS PROGRAM IS A VORD SEARCH PUZZLE GENERATOR! ! 
THE PROGRAM TAKES A SET OF INPUT STRINGS, PURGES ALL 
NON-ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS OUT OF THEM, AND INCORPORATES 
THEM INTO A WORD SEARCH PUZZLE. 


IN THE COURSE OF MAKING THE PUZZLE, THE MACHINE MAY 
FIND THAT IT CaN’T PUT A PARTICULAR WORD ANYWHERE, AND 
SO WILL ASK YOU IF IT SHOULD START THE WHOLE PUZZLE 
OVER. IF YOU DON’T WANT IT TO START OVER, TYPING ‘NO’ 
WILL THROU AVAY THAT PARTICULAR WORD. IF THIS PERSISTS, 
TRY EITHER GIVING LESS WORDS OR BIGGER PUZZLE DIMENSIONS!

The Genesis of Wumpus 

Two years ago | happened by People’s Computer 
Company (PCC) and saw some of their computer games — 
such as Hurkle, Snark, and Mugwump. My reaction was: 
“EECH!!”’ Each of these games was based on a 10 x 10 grid 
in Cartesian co-ordinates and three of them was too much 
for me. | started to think along the lines of: “There has to 
be a hide and seek computer game without that (exp. 
deleted) grid!!’ In fact, why not a topological computer 
game — imagine a set of points connected in some way and 
the player moves about the set via the interconnections. 

That afternoon in meditation the phrase “‘Hunt the 
Wumpus” arrived, and Wumpus was born. He’s still a bit 
vague in physical detail as most dedicated Wumpus hunters 
know, but appearances are part of the game. (If you like, 
send me a picture of your version of a Wumpus. Perhaps 
friendly Dave, our editor, will publish the best one in 
Creative Computing.) The grid | chose was the vertices of a 
dodecahedron — simply because it’s my favorite Platonic 
solid and once, ages ago, | made a kite shaped like one. The 
edges became the connecting tunnels between the caves 
which were the set of points for the game. 

My basic idea at this time was for the player to approach 
the Wumpus, back off, and come up to him by going 
around the dodecahedron. To my knowledge, this has never 
happened... most players adopt other strategies rather 
than this cold-blooded approach. 

Anyway ... how to get the Wumpus! How about an 
arrow which could turn corners as it goes from room to 
room. Let the hunter tell the arrow where to go and let it 
fly. The shortest round trip without reversals is 5 caves — 
and thus the Crooked Arrow. 

Hmmm... How does one sense the Wumpus? It’s dark 
in yonder cave, and light would wake him up. If one got 
one cave away, the wumpus's distinct smell would serve as a 
warning. So far, so good ... but Wumpus is still too easy, 
so let’s find some appropriate hazards for the caves. 

Bottomless pits were easy. Any imaginary cave would 
have a few of those around the place. Superbats were 
harder to come by. It took me a day or two to get that 
idea. The Superbats are a sort of rapid transit system gone a 
little batty (sorry about that one). They take you a random 
distance to a random cave and leave you there. If that’s a 
pit or a Wumpus, well, you are in Fate’s hands. 

Around this time, | saw that Map-making would be a 
regular activity of Wumpus-hunters. | numbered the caves 
and made the scheme fixed in the hopes a practised player 
might notice this and make himself a permanent map of the 
caverns. (Another unrealised hope — as an exercise, make 
yourself such a map on a Squashed Dodecahedron). 

To start the game fairly, Wumpus, Hazards, and Hunter 
are located on different points at the start of the game. 
Each game starts with random choices of location, but the 


178 


A Squashed 
Dodecahedron 


hunter may restart with the same set-up if he chooses. This 
allows re-plays if the hunter, say, fell into a pit on the first 
move. 

Wumpus was nearly done in my mind... (hint to a 
games-writer: Have a clear notion of your game before you 
start coding it. This saves MUCH confusion.) yet | felt it 
was a bit dull. Once you found the Wumpus all you had to 
do was shoot it. To fix this, the Wumpus was given a little 
life. If you shot an arrow or moved into his cave, he woke 
up and chose to move to a neighboring room or to the same 
room (one of 4 choices). If you and the Wumpus were in 
the same room after he moved, he ATE YOU UP!! 

Around here I noticed that the pits and the bats didn’t 
affect the Wumpus. To explain this, | added some color by 
making him heavy and with the legendary sucker feet. After 
all, evolution works in strange ways!! If you are a Wumpus 
fiend, make a version of Wumpus in which he avoids pits and 
superbats can carry him only one room (with the possibility 
of being dumped into your cave). This can be done by 
making the wumpus moving procedure a subroutine. 

| wrote Wumpus and dropped it off at PCC. Then | went 
home and dreamed up Wumpus 2. 


The Birth of Wumpus 

Around a month later, | went to the Synergy conference 
at Stanford, where many of the far-out folk were gathered 
to share their visions of improving the world. PCC had a 
few terminals running in a conference room and | dropped 
by. To my vast surprise, all of the terminals were running 
Wumpus and scraps of paper on the floor with scrawled 
numbers and lines testified that much dedicated Wumpus- 
hunting was in progress. | had spawned a hit computer 
game!!! 

Later, PCC published Wumpus in its newsletter, and 
Creative Computing published it in their Sep/Oct 1975 
issue. 

Wumpus and this writeup are the products of the talented 
and creative Gregory Yob.

INSTRUCTIONS (Y-N)? Y 
WELCOME TO “HUNT THE WUMPUS’ 

THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 20 ROOMS. EACH ROOK 
HAS 3 TUNWELS LEADING TO OTHER ROOMS. (LOOK AT A 
DODECAHEDROW TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS-IF YOU DON’T KNOW 
WHAT A DODECHADROW IS, ASK SOMEONE) 


HAZARDS: 
BOTTOALESS PITS - TWO ROOMS HAVE BOTTOMLESS PITS IN THERM 
IF YOU GO THERE, YOU FALL INTO THE PIT (2 LOSE!) 
SUPERBATS - TWO OTHER ROOMS HAVE SUPER BATS. IF YOU 
GO THERE, A BAT GRABS YOU AWD TAKES YOU TO SOME OTHER 
ROOM AT RANDOM. (WHICH AIGHT BE TROUBLESOME) 


WUMPUS: 
THE UUMPUS IS WOT BOTHERED BY THE HAZARDS (HE HAS SUCKER 
FEET AND IS TOO BIG FOR A BAT TO LIFT). USUALLY 
HE IS ASLEEP. TYO THINGS THAT YAKE HIM UP: YOUR ENTERING 
HIS ROOM OR YOUR SHOOTING AN ARROU. 

IF THE WUAPUS WAKES, HE MOVES (P=.75) ONE ROOM 
OR STAYS STILL (P=.25). AFTER THAT, IF HE IS UHERE YOU 
ARE, HE EATS YOU UP (& YOU LOSE!) 


YOU: 
EACH TURN YOU MAY MOVE OR SHOOT A CROOKED ARROU 
MOVING: YOU CAN GO ONE ROOM (THRU ONE TUNNEL) 
ARROWS: YOU HAVE 5 ARROUS. YOU LOSE WHEN YOU RUN OUT. 


EACH ARROW CAN GO FROM 1 TO 5 ROOMS. YOU AIM BY TELLING 


THE COMPUTER TTHE ROOM#S YOU WANT THE ARROW TO GO TO. 


IF THE ARROW CAN’T GO THAT WAY (IE NO TUNNEL) IT MOVES 


AT RANDOM TO THE WEXT ROOM. 
IF THE ARROW HITS THE YUMPUS, YOU WIN. 
IF THE ARROW HITS YOU, YOU LOSE. 


WARNINGS: 
WHEN YOU ARE ONE ROOM AWAY FROM WUMPUS OR HAZARD,

Hark!! The weary Wumpus hunter, wan from 50 days in 
the Terminal Caverns, exhausted and with all of his arrows 
expended — — — (A groaning Teletype roars at a sleepy 
student. Maps litter the floor covered with circles and 
integers. With callused fingers, the immortal Wumpus player 
looks up with bloodshot eyes and implores: “How do | get 
out of here?’’) 

| suspected that the dodecahedron may prove a bit 
boring after a few thousand games, so | wrote Wumpus 2 to 
extend your pleasure. Some of the more mathematical 
minded may have noticed there are lots of ways to link 
caves with three tunnels apiece. Some of these patterns are 
topologically interesting... . 


Wumpus 2 is the same old Wumpus tn different settings 
— including those of your own design. As you play in the 
different caves, you will notice that the game changes in 
difficulty and strategy. Now to a description of the various 
caves in Wumpus 2. 





CAVE 0 (Dodecahedron) 
This is the same old ‘Wumpus with which you are 
familiar. 


CAVE 1 (Mobius Strip) 

Since my original vision was topological, here is the first 
wonder of topology, the Mobius strip. Take a strip of 
paper, give it a half-twist and join the ends into a loop. The 
result has just one side and one edge (if you disbelieve, take 
a pencil and go around the thing). 

A perceptive player will note that the placement of the 
pits influence the game. Two pits placed just right (around 
5% of the games have this) will force a detour back around 
the strip in certain cases. Getting around is slower than in 
Cave 0, but it is easier to search the place. 


CAVE 2 (String of Beads) 

See the diagram for this one. Here, placement of the pits 
will often make parts of the caves inaccessible except by 
bat-express. (Can you see why?) Play in this cave is 
frustrating until you have gone to the trouble of making a 
reference map; otherwise you keep coming back to your 
starting point. (Look at the diagram and see how this may 
be so.) 


CAVE 3 (Hex Network) 

This is my attempt at a torus (doughnut). If you can 
visualise a hexagon net like a honeycomb or a tile floor and 
stretch it onto a doughnut, you've got it!! The drawing tries 
to show this, but if you prefer, think of it as a complicated 
molecule of some sort. Play in this one is very similar to 
CAVE 0. 


CAVE 4 (Dendrite) 

Up to now, each tunnel leads to another cave and only 
one tunnel connects a pair of caves. This need not be a 
strict rule and the next two caves illustrate variations on 
this. The dendrite is a branching pattern like a tree or a 
plant. At the ends of the plant are “‘leaves’’ which are caves 
leading to themselves or multiple tunnels. This cave is 
especially susceptible to severance by pits and getting stuck 
in corners near the wumpus. A nice thing is that you often 
will know exactly where the Wumpus is when you come 
near him.

CAVE 5 (one way streets) 

This is the extreme example of all tunnels are one-way. 
You will find that getting about this cave is like travel in 
Los Angeles — much going to get to the neighbor's house. If 
you overshoot, you must travel all the way around, just like 
missing a freeway offramp. 


CAVE 6 {Do Your OWN) 

Draw up a map of caves, each cave with tunnels GOING 
TO three (exactly three) caves (same or different). Then the 
computer will ask you for the numbers of the destination 
tunnels for each of the 20 caves in Wumpus. When you have 
it entered, play Wumpus on your own caves. Let me know 
of your favorite ones, and your most frustrating ones!!! 


FINIS 
In any case, Wumpus has spawned several versions and 
spread about the computer games-dom really nicely. For 
myself, the soul of the game is in the idea and fun of it 
rather than the program or the computer which hosts it. | 
feel that all really good games will turn programmers on 
enough for them to write it for their system from the idea 
alone and encourage games writers to think carefully on the 
art and esthetics of their games before writing a line of 
code. 
Wumpus-2 and this description are products of Gregory 
Yob. They appeared previously in Creative Computing, 
Jan/Feb 1976 and the game in People’s Computer Co.

WELCOME TO YUMPUS II 
THIS VERSION HAS THE SAME RULES AS “HUNT THE WUMPUS’. 
HOVEVER, YOU NOW HAVE A CHOICE OF CAVES TO PLAY IW. 
SOME CAVES ARE EASIER THAN OTHERS. ALL CAVES HAVE 20 
ROOMS AND 3 TUNNELS LEADING FROM ONE ROOM TO OTHER ROOKS. 
THE CAVES ARE: 
0 - DODECAHEDRON THE ROOMS OF THIS CAVE ARE ON A 
12-SIDED OBJECT, EACH FORMING A PENTAGON. 
THE ROOMS ARE AT THE CORNERS OF THE PENTAGONS. 
EACH ROOM HAVING TUNNELS THAT LEAD TO 3 OTHER ROOMS 


MOBIUS STRIP THIS CAVE IS TUO ROOMS 
VIDE AND 10 ROOMS AROUND (LIKE A BELT) 
YOU WILL NOTICE THERE IS A HALF TUIST 
SOMEVHERE. 


tt 
' 


STRING OF BEADS FIVE BEADS IN A CIRCLE. 
EACH BEAD IS A DIAMOND WITH A VERTICAL 
CROSS-BAR. THE RIGHT & LEFT CORNERS LEAD 

TO NEIGHBORING BEADS. (THIS ONE IS DIFFICULT 
TO PLAY) 


HEX NEUORK IMAGINE A HEX TILE FLOOR. TAKE 

A RECTANGLE WITH 20 POINTS (INTERSECTIONS) 
INSIDE (4X4). JOIN RIGHT & LEFT SIDES TO MAKE A 
CYLINDER. THEN JOIN TOP 2 BOTTOM TO FORM A 
TORUS (DOUGHNUT). 

HAVE FUN IMAGINING THIS ONE!! 


CAVES 1-3 ARE REGULAR IN A SENSE THAT EACH ROOM 
GOES TO THREE OTHER ROOMS & TUNNELS ALLOW TUO- 
WAY TRAFFIC. HERE ARE SOME “IRREGULAR” CAVES: 

4 - DENDRITE YITH DEGENERACIES PULL A PLANT FROM 
THE GROUND. THE ROOTS & BRANCHES FORM A 
DEWDRITE - IE., THERE ARE NO LOOPING PATHS 
DEGENERACY MEANS A) SOME ROOMS CONNECT TO 
THEMSELVES AND B) SOME ROOMS HAVE MORE THAN OWE 
TUNNEL TO THE SAME OTHER ROOM IE, 12 HAS 
TWO TUNNELS TO 13. 


ONE WAY LATTICE HERE ALL TUNNELS GO ONE 
UAY ONLY. TO RETURN, YOU MUST GO AROUND THE CAVE 
(ABOUT 5 MOVES). 
6 - ENTER YOUR OUN CAVE THE COMPUTER WILL ASK YoU 
THE ROOMS WEXT TO EACH ROOM IN THE CAVE. 
FOR EXAMPLE: 
ROOM 1 ? 2,3,4 - YOUR REPLY OF 2,3,4 
MEANS ROOM 1 HAS TUNNELS GOING TO ROOMS: 
2,3, 24.
