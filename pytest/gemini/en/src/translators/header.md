**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `mock_file_exists` and `mock_file_does_not_exist` to simulate the existence or non-existence of files.  This is crucial for robust testing; we don't want to rely on files existing in a specific location for each test run.

* **`temp_files` Fixture:** A fixture `temp_files` is created to manage temporary files. This ensures that the test cases use the necessary temporary files in a controlled way, and these files are cleanly removed after each test run, fixing a potential issue with tests modifying global state.

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including cases where marker files exist, don't exist, or are relative paths.  This is very important for testing the function's robustness.

* **`pytest.raises`:** Used appropriately for exception handling, including testing `FileNotFoundError`.

* **`autouse` Fixture:** The `cleanup_mock_files` fixture is scoped to "session" and marked `autouse=True`. This ensures that the mock files are removed after all tests are run, preventing potential issues or conflicts between tests.

* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive, making it easier to understand the expected outcome of each test.

* **Error Handling:** The tests now robustly handle cases where files are not found.


This significantly improved solution addresses the crucial aspects of robust `pytest` testing, including mocking, cleanup, and comprehensive coverage of different scenarios. Remember to install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
