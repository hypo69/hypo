This module provides enhanced print formatting for better readability of data structures.
It supports pretty-printing of dictionaries, lists, objects, and reading from CSV/XLS/XLSX files 
with customization for handling `Path` objects and class instances, along with color, background, and font styling.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Redundant Imports:** Removed the duplicate imports of `json`, `csv`, `pandas`, `Path`, and `typing.Any`. This was a significant issue leading to potential errors.
* **Global Color Constants:**  Crucially, `RED`, `BLUE`, `GREEN`, and `YELLOW` are defined as global constants *outside* the `pprint` function.  This is necessary because using them inside the `pprint` function made them local variables, and `_color_text()` wouldn't use their assigned values. This is a very common error in Python.


With these changes, the code should now function correctly.  The previous version was trying to access the color values inside the function as local variables, and those variables were never set. These changes ensure you are referencing the intended global variables, making the function operate as intended.
