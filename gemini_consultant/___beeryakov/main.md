**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Crucially, the code now includes `try...except` blocks. This prevents the entire script from crashing if there's a problem (like a website being down, incorrect data, or problems with the Google Sheet API).  Error messages are logged using `logger`, making debugging much easier.  Handling `FileNotFoundError` is vital for the service account credentials, and `APIError` for Google Sheet access.
* **Service Account Credentials:** The code now prompts for a service account file.  Replace `"your_service_account_credentials.json"` with the actual path to your file. This is **essential** for accessing Google Sheets without user authentication.
* **Correct `gspread` import:** Imports `gspread` correctly.
* **Worksheet Creation and Handling:** It now properly creates a worksheet if one doesn't exist, avoiding the `AttributeError`.  Crucially, it clears the existing data using `ws.clear()`.  This prevents data from appending to the sheet.
* **Clearer Logic:** The code is now structured to handle errors and recover from problems during each stage of the process, making it far more robust.
* **`pprint` removed:**  Since the main logic now is structured within the `for` loops, it was redundant and error-prone.
* **Explicit Header:** Adds a header row to the spreadsheet to clarify the data. This will help in understanding the data structure.
* **Import `gspread_formatting`:**   This is useful for formatting in the future, but commented out here.  You can use it later.
* **`sh.worksheet`:** This method is used to fetch the worksheet if it exists or create it if not.  This is crucial for avoiding the `AttributeError`.


**Before Running:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium gspread oauth2client gspread-formatting
   ```

2. **Google Cloud Project Setup:**  Follow instructions to set up a service account in your Google Cloud project and download the service account JSON file.  Place this file in the same directory as your Python script.  This file is needed for authentication to Google Sheets.


**How to use:**

1. Replace `"your_service_account_credentials.json"` with the actual path to your credentials file.
2. Run the script. It will now attempt to connect to Google Sheets, fetch and parse data, and populate the worksheet, logging any errors along the way.


This significantly improved solution is much more robust and reliable. Remember to handle potential exceptions (like network issues or invalid data) in a production environment to create a truly robust solution.
