**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive and indicate the test case's purpose.

2. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is self-contained, preventing unintended side effects.

3. **Valid/Invalid Input:**  Tests are included to check both valid inputs and missing required fields (e.g., `spreadsheet_id`) for both classes (`SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet`). This is crucial for robust testing.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** `pytest.raises` is used for exception handling, ensuring the code correctly handles errors.  Crucially, it includes a `match` argument to ensure the correct error message is raised.

5. **Fixtures (if needed):** Fixtures are commented out.  If your `SpreadSheet` or `ReachSpreadsheet` classes require data setup (e.g., creating a spreadsheet object with specific data), you would add fixtures.

6. **Comments:** Comments explain the logic of each test case, making the test suite more understandable.

7. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The provided examples show a base structure. You need to expand these tests to cover all aspects of the `SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` classes, including methods (e.g., `get_data`, `update_data`, etc.), potential exceptions, and edge cases (like empty spreadsheets or sheets).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_spreadsheet.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_spreadsheet.py
    ```

This improved structure will make your test suite more effective in verifying the correctness and robustness of your code.  Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the actual implementation details for the `SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` classes and their methods.  You'll need to adapt the `test_spreadsheet_init_valid` example to reflect the initialization of the `ReachSpreadsheet` class as well. Remember to add tests for *methods*, and not only the constructors.
