```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement import Facebook


# Tests for Facebook class
def test_facebook_initialization():
    """Tests the initialization of the Facebook class."""
    # Valid initialization (no arguments)
    facebook_instance = Facebook()
    assert isinstance(facebook_instance, Facebook)


@pytest.mark.parametrize("mode", ['dev', 'prod'])
def test_facebook_mode_property(mode):
    """Tests the MODE property of the Facebook class. 
       Checks that the correct mode is set based on the mode parameter."""
    Facebook.MODE = mode
    assert Facebook.MODE == mode



def test_facebook_no_attribute():
    """Tests access to an attribute that doesn't exist."""
    facebook_instance = Facebook()
    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
        facebook_instance.nonexistent_attribute  # Should raise AttributeError
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive, clearly indicating the purpose of each test (e.g., `test_facebook_initialization`, `test_facebook_mode_property`).
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  A `test_facebook_no_attribute` test is added to demonstrate exception handling using `pytest.raises`. This is crucial for robustness.
* **Parametrization:** The `test_facebook_mode_property` now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with different mode values ('dev', 'prod'). This is a good practice for testing different configurations.
* **Valid Initialization Test:** A `test_facebook_initialization` is added to verify that the class initializes correctly.
* **Missing Functionality Handling:**  The provided code just imports a class, so the tests are limited to verifying the existence of the class and its initialization and getting the value of the property MODE.  More tests would be required if the `Facebook` class had methods or attributes with logic to test.


**Further Test Considerations (if the code in `Facebook` class had methods):**

If the `Facebook` class in `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook.py` had methods (e.g., `get_ads`, `create_campaign`), you would need to add tests for them. For example:

```python
# Assuming a get_ads method in the Facebook class
def test_facebook_get_ads_valid_input():
    """Tests the get_ads method with valid input."""
    facebook_instance = Facebook()
    # Replace with actual valid input for get_ads
    ads_list = facebook_instance.get_ads(some_valid_input) 
    # Assert on the expected behavior of the get_ads method.
    assert isinstance(ads_list, list)  # Or whatever you expect the return type to be.
    # Add more assertions based on the expected structure of the returned data.

def test_facebook_get_ads_invalid_input():
    """Tests the get_ads method with invalid input."""
    facebook_instance = Facebook()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        facebook_instance.get_ads(some_invalid_input) # or an empty string
    assert "Invalid input" in str(excinfo.value) # Or whatever error message you expect
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `some_valid_input` and `some_invalid_input` with actual data appropriate for the `Facebook` class's methods.  Provide appropriate fixtures to set up the required input data in a well organized way if needed.


These additional tests would demonstrate a complete testing suite covering different scenarios for your code.  The examples above are based on the assumption of possible methods and attributes;  you must adapt them to the specific logic in your code.  Be sure to thoroughly test your classes and methods with varied input types and conditions. Remember to add docstrings to your tests as well.
