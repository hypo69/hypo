```

**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints (`-> Path`, `:param`, `:type`, `:returns`, `:raises`) for better code clarity and readability.
- Changed variable names to be more descriptive (e.g., `root_dir` instead of `__root__`).
- Improved the error handling with more specific exception types and informative messages.
- Created a more readable way to construct paths using `PROJECT_ROOT` and pathlib's path operations.
- Corrected the `copyrihgnt` typo in the variable name to `copyright`.
- Added a docstring to the `get_project_root` function with explicit return type, parameters, and potential exceptions.
- Fixed a potential issue where `__root__` was not used consistently.
- Added missing `encoding='utf-8'` in `open()` calls for consistent file handling.
- Improved variable naming and clarity.


**Note:**  The `gs` module is used, but it's not defined.  Make sure that the necessary imports for `gs` are present in the project.  Also, consider adding tests to thoroughly validate the functionality of this code (e.g., using `pytest`).
