```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Focus on HTML Structure:** The tests now primarily focus on validating the structure of the HTML file, as testing the JavaScript and backend interaction directly is impossible without those components.
* **Mocking jQuery AJAX:**  The `test_jquery_ajax_call` function is crucial for unit testing in this scenario. You *cannot* test the AJAX call without a mocked or stubbed environment, preventing actual network calls to the backend. This example utilizes a basic mock that checks for the existence of the `success` function. 
* **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more specific about what should be in the HTML output, making the tests more robust.
* **Placeholder Tests:** The placeholder tests like `test_invalid_user_input` are important starting points for testing edge cases. You would need to replace these placeholders with specific assertions on the expected output after implementing the necessary JavaScript/backend checks.

**To make these tests fully functional:**

1. **Backend Mocking:**  Set up a mock backend (e.g., using `unittest.mock` or a similar framework) to respond to the `/ask` endpoint with example data, and return a suitable JSON response. This will simulate the backend interaction.
2. **JavaScript Environment:** You'll need a way to simulate a browser environment (such as Selenium or similar tools), or a way to run and test the JavaScript code directly from the HTML file (if appropriate).  Mocking is necessary to isolate the HTML's JavaScript behavior.


This revised answer provides a solid starting point for your `pytest` tests, focusing on what is testable within the HTML file itself. Remember to adapt the assertions based on the actual JavaScript and backend logic. Remember that a crucial part of this kind of testing is isolating the code under test.  These tests only test the HTML structure and AJAX setup, not the backend API. You need separate tests to verify the backend.
