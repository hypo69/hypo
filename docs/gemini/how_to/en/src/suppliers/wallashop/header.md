## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/header.py`

This file sets up the project environment and retrieves project metadata, such as the project name, version, and documentation.  It's crucial for initializing the project and accessing its settings.

**1. Project Root Directory Determination:**

The `set_project_root()` function is the core of this initialization. It dynamically finds the root directory of the project.

```python
def set_project_root(marker_files=(\'pyproject.toml\', \'requirements.txt\', \'.git\')) -> Path:
    # ... (function body)
```

* **Functionality:**  It starts from the current file's directory and recursively checks parent directories until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). This ensures the correct project location is identified, even if the script is run from a subdirectory.

* **Arguments:**
    * `marker_files`: A tuple of file/directory names to use as markers for the project root.  If any of these are found in a parent directory, that directory is considered the root.


* **Return Value:**
    * `Path`: The path to the root directory. If no suitable root directory is found, it returns the directory of the script itself.
    * The function also adds the project root to `sys.path` so Python can import modules from within the project.

**2. Project Metadata Retrieval:**

```python
__root__ = set_project_root()
# ... (rest of the file)
```

* This code retrieves the project's settings from `src/settings.json` and also optional `src/README.MD` for a description/documentation string:
```python
settings = None
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```

* **Error Handling:** The code uses `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions when reading `settings.json` and `README.MD`. This prevents the script from crashing if these files are missing or corrupted.

* **Project metadata variables:**
  * `__project_name__`: The project name, derived from the `settings.json` file, defaulting to 'hypotez'.
  * `__version__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`: Additional metadata from the `settings.json` file.
  * `__doc__`: Optional documentation string from `README.MD`.


**3. Import `gs`:**
```python
from src import gs
```

* This imports the `gs` module which is likely a custom module containing utilities needed for the rest of the project.


**How to Use:**

This script should be imported into other parts of the project.  The project root and the other variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc.) will be available for use in the calling script. Example usage:


```python
from wallashop.header import __project_name__
print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path.root`:**  The script assumes the existence of a `gs` module that provides a `path` attribute with a `root` property, enabling it to locate the root directory.  You will need to have that `gs` module set up in your project.  

* **Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors (e.g., missing files, invalid JSON) when reading files and parsing data.

* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the `packaging` library is installed.  This is used for the `Version` type.

* **File organization:**  The assumption is that `src` is at the top level of your project.  If this differs, adjust the file paths accordingly.
