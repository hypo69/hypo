```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the tests now mock the `smtplib` and `imaplib` functions. This avoids sending real emails (and the potential need for a test email account) and allows for more controlled testing of the logic within the `send` and `receive` functions.
2. **Mock Logger:** A `MockLogger` class is introduced to capture log messages during tests, making it easier to verify if the error logging is working as expected.
3. **Environment Variables (Fixture):**  The `mock_env_vars` fixture now correctly sets up the necessary environment variables, making the tests more robust.
4. **Comprehensive `send` Tests:** The `test_send_invalid_input` now correctly tests the case where the receiver is missing from the _connection dictionary
5. **Comprehensive `receive` Tests:** The `test_receive_valid_input` now uses mocks to create a simulated successful email retrieval scenario.
6. **Error Handling:**  The `test_receive_invalid_input`  demonStartes the error handling in the `receive` function by testing a connection that should fail, and confirming that `None` is returned,  as expected.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Replace `"src.logger.logger import logger"` with an appropriate import path to your logger.
3.  Put the `mock_env_vars` call in `conftest.py` if that file exists in your project.
4.  Run `pytest` in your terminal from the directory containing your tests.

This improved solution effectively tests the code without relying on external email services, providing a significantly more thorough test suite. Remember to adapt the mock data to match the specific structure of your expected email data.
