**Changes Made**

*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to the module and all variables.
*   Replaced all instances of `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.  Import `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns` and `logger` are added (assuming these are defined elsewhere).
*   Replaced vague comments with more specific language and proper RST format.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
*   Improved variable names where possible.
*   Included `TODO` items (commented out) to illuStarte improvements needed for future enhancements.
