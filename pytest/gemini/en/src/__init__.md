# IMPORTANT:  Replace the example comments and placeholder assertions with
# the actual tests based on the expected behavior of the `credentials` module.
# Investigate the `gs` object in the `credentials` module.  Is it a function,
# a class, or something else?  These example tests assume it's either a function
# or a class with a `get_credentials` method.  Adapt them to the correct type.

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Structure:** The provided template is now more robust.  It separates tests based on the components (`MODE` and `gs`) and includes detailed docstrings.


2. **Flexibility for `gs`:** The tests now handle different possible implementations of `gs` (function, class, or other type).  The example shows how to test if `gs` is imported and *which* type it is (function, class),  as this is critical to writing effective tests.   Crucially, the example *assumes* `gs` might be a function that needs a parameter, a class, or something else. You need to change the tests to *exactly* fit the behavior of your `gs` object from the `credentials` module.


3. **Example Fixture:** An example fixture (`example_gs_data`) is included to demonstrate how to prepare test data if your `gs` object needs input.


4. **Exception Handling:** Example tests demonstrating how to use `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions.


5. **Meaningful Assertions:** Replace placeholder assertions like `assert result == "expected_output"` with your actual expected outcomes.


6. **Complete Test Coverage:** Consider all possible input scenarios. What types of data does `gs` accept?  Does `gs` produce exceptions in certain cases?  Your tests must cover these situations.


**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Update the test functions to correctly reflect the `credentials` module's implementation of the `gs` object.  Specifically:
   - Determine if `gs` is a function, a class, a method, or something else.
   - Adjust the test names and assertions to match the `gs` object's expected behavior.

2. **Add necessary fixtures:** If your functions require any setup or data, add the appropriate fixtures.

3. **Run tests:** Execute `pytest` in your terminal to run the test suite.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Data Structure:** If `gs` returns a complex data structure, be sure to test different aspects of the output.
- **Error Handling:** If `gs` raises specific exceptions, test them accordingly.
- **Edge Cases:** Think about edge cases (e.g., empty input, very large input) for your functions.


This revised example is significantly better equipped to handle a wider variety of possible implementations of the `gs` object. You must still adapt it precisely to your code. Remember to replace the example comments and assertions with the correct ones.
