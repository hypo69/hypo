**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added `TypeError` handling for non-string input and a check for empty input strings.  This is crucial for robustness.

2. **Placeholder Logic:**  The `generate_person_contexts` function now includes a placeholder for actual context generation. This is vital because the given prompt description is for a complex, language model-based function.  The example in the function, however, *still* uses sample output (this should be replaced by real AI or language model output in production).

3. **Comprehensive Tests:** Added tests for various scenarios: valid input, empty input, invalid input type, and a test for a more complex query.  Crucially, the test for the complex query doesn't try to assert on specific content.  Instead, it asserts that the function *returns something*.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the test's purpose.

5. **pytest.raises:**  Used `pytest.raises` correctly to test for `TypeError`.

6. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to the function to clarify its purpose and parameters.


**To make this even more robust:**

* **Replace the Placeholder:** You would need to replace the placeholder `try...except` block with the actual AI call using a library for interacting with a language model (like OpenAI's API, for example).
* **Mock Language Model:** For testing, you might want to mock the language model call to simulate different responses and ensure your code handles various outcomes.
* **Specific Assertions (Advanced):**  For complex scenarios, you might need more sophisticated assertions, e.g., checking if the generated contexts have certain keywords or follow specified patterns.  This would depend heavily on what's expected from the AI.

Remember to install pytest: `pip install pytest` before running the tests. Remember to replace the placeholder AI logic with your actual implementation.  The example functions now test *that the function itself works as intended*, but you still need to test the AI output.
