**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `Driver`:** The provided code relies on an external `Driver` class.  Crucially, the test now uses `MockDriver` to isolate the `Graber` class from the actual WebDriver interaction. This is essential for unit tests.

2. **`pytest.fixture` for `Graber`:** A `pytest.fixture` creates a `Graber` instance, ensuring each test gets its own isolated object.  This prevents unexpected state changes between tests.


3. **`mock_driver` Fixture:** Provides a mocked driver instance for the tests.


4. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test names are more descriptive (`test_graber_init`, `test_graber_locator_decorator_default`), and they focus on specific aspects of the class.


5. **Example `test_graber_locator_decorator_custom`:** A test demonstrating the correct operation of the decorator with a custom locator.  Critically, it resets `Context.locator_for_decorator` afterwards.

6. **Testing `close_pop_up` (Hypothetical):** Demonstrates how to structure tests for the decorator if present. Note the need to *mock* the relevant parts of the decorator logic to test it independently.


7. **Placeholder Tests (`test_graber_function_mock`)**: Placeholder examples on how to test methods within `Graber`.  You'll need to replace `my_function`, and add relevant assertions.

8. **Exception Handling:** Includes a placeholder `test_graber_exception_handling`.  **You MUST replace the placeholder logic with the actual exception handling expected from the Graber code**.


**Before running these tests:**

* **Replace the placeholders**:  The placeholder tests like `test_graber_function_mock` and the example `test_my_function_with_decorator` require you to replace the placeholder function with the actual functions from your `graber.py` file, and modify assertions to match your expected outcomes.


* **Implement missing `close_pop_up` tests**:  The example tests for the hypothetical decorator (`close_pop_up`) require you to fill in the mocked interactions and expected behavior.


* **Import Correct Modules**: Make sure you have the correct module imports (`hypotez.src.*`).


* **Install pytest:** Ensure you have the `pytest` library installed (`pip install pytest`).


With these improvements, you'll have a robust test suite to verify your Graber class, which avoids relying on external dependencies, and thus making your tests more reliable. Remember to adapt the test cases to match your specific functionality. Remember to replace placeholder content (like the example function calls) with the relevant parts of your code.
