**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling and Robustness:**  The original code didn't handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might not exist. The tests now include cases where these files are missing and verify appropriate fallback behavior.
* **Data Creation and Cleanup:** The tests now properly create temporary directory structures needed for testing and correctly remove them using `test_root.rmdir()`. Crucial for keeping tests clean.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **`os.chdir`:** Using `os.chdir` to change the working directory is essential for the tests to find the correct files when the current file path is used to locate the root directory.
* **Handling Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` test checks for the case where no specified marker files are present in the path.
* **Dummy File Creation:**  The tests now create a dummy Python file to represent a typical project file that would be used in a real project.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as `test_header.py` in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/suppliers/header.py` file.
2.  Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved set of tests is more comprehensive and robust, providing better coverage for `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace the dummy file paths (`"./test_project/src/suppliers/test_header.py"`) with actual file paths if needed in a more realistic testing environment. Also consider using a virtual environment to isolate the test environment and prevent conflicts.
