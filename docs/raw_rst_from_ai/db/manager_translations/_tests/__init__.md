Module: src.db.manager_translations._tests

This module contains the test suite for the `manager_translations`
database module.  It likely houses unit tests for various aspects of the
translation management functions.  The `__init__.py` file serves as the entry
point for the test suite, importing necessary tests and versioning information.
"""

# Version information; note use of packaging.version for compatibility.
from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__


# Add imports for individual test files here (if any)
# Example:
# from .test_translation_manager import *
# from .test_data_loading import *
# from .test_update_translations import *

```

**Explanation of improvements and why they're better:**

* **Clearer Docstring:** The docstring now explicitly states the module's purpose (testing the `manager_translations` module) and its role as the test suite entry point.  This is crucial for understanding the module's function within the overall project structure.
* **Contextual Description:** The docstring provides context about the tests it contains.  This might suggest where the tests would live.
* **`__init__.py` purpose emphasis:**  Explicitly stating the role of this file as an entry point for the test suite (important when running tests)
* **Placeholder Imports:**  Added placeholder imports (`from .test_translation_manager import *`).  This is crucial in a real-world scenario.  The user (or other developers working with the project) should add the actual import statements from their respective test files here. This is standard practice and makes the file usable.

**How to use it:**

1. Create test files (e.g., `test_translation_manager.py`, `test_data_loading.py`).
2. Write your tests within these files.
3. Ensure these files are in the `hypotez/src/db/manager_translations/_tests` directory.
4. Import the tests into the `__init__.py` file as shown in the example placeholder imports.

This revised `__init__.py` file provides a more professional and informative structure, especially useful for larger test suites. The placeholder imports highlight how to integrate the tests and the module itself.  This also helps in avoiding potential issues if the test suite wasn't being utilized or understood.
