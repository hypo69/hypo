```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Version Checks:** The original tests were very basic. The provided test `test_version_is_valid_version_object` now checks that `__version__` is an instance of the `Version` object, which is crucial for ensuring the version string is correctly parsed.  The `test_version_string_format` adds a basic check to see if the string format is correct, but more robust checks could be made if the version string format had some expected structure.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive, clearly indicating the purpose of each test.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage (Example):** The `test_docstring_is_a_string` and `test_details_is_a_string` are added to cover the `__doc__` and `__details__` attributes, which are likely to be important elements of the module.

4. **Robustness:** The tests now include basic validation checks. For example, instead of just checking if `__version__` is a string, it's checked to be an instance of `Version`.

5. **Example of Handling Additional Functions/Classes:** The commented-out example (`test_function_with_invalid_input`) demonstrates how to test a function that might raise exceptions, using `pytest.raises`.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_examples.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py`.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_examples.py
    ```

This improved set of tests provides a more complete and reliable way to ensure the integrity of the `__version__` object and related data within the `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py` file. Remember to adapt and extend the tests based on the actual functions and classes defined in the file. Remember that the more specific the tests, the better the coverage.
