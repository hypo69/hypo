Module: src.product

Defines the `product` type.
This file defines a TypedDict representing the structure of a product.
Each field corresponds to a potential attribute of a product.
The use of `Optional` indicates that a field may not always have a value.
The types are primarily designed for data transfer and storage, not necessarily for direct use in calculations or logic.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the `ProductType` class and each attribute.  This significantly improves the readability and understanding of the code.  Explanations now clarify the purpose and potential use cases of each attribute.
* **Clarity:** Added a brief overall description at the beginning of the module-level docstring, explaining the file's role and the data it represents.
* **`total=False`:** The `total=False` argument in `TypedDict` is crucial. It indicates that not all fields are *required*.  This better reflects the structure of product data in real-world scenarios.
* **`Optional` Type Hinting:**  Using `Optional[type]` correctly expresses that fields can be absent.


This revised code is much more self-documenting and helpful for anyone reading or working with this `ProductType` definition.  It effectively conveys the meaning and purpose of each attribute, making it easier to understand and use. Remember to include the `Optional` type hints for all fields.
