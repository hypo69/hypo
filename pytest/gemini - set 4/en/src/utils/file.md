```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Imports `os` for file operations, and more critically the specific functions from the `hypotez.src.utils.file` module for testing. This is crucial to avoid errors and ensure the correct modules are used.

2. **Fixtures:**  Added `test_file_path` and `test_dir` fixtures for creating and managing temporary test files and directories in a more controlled way, as the original code created files in the test.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - Added tests for `save_text_file` covering valid string, list, and dictionary inputs, plus an `invalid_file_path` case to check error handling.
   - Added tests for `read_text_file` covering valid file and non-existent file situations, as well as `as_list` mode.
   - Added tests for `get_filenames` (now correctly tests a directory and checks if the files are present).
   - Added tests for `recursively_read_text_files`, and important `test_remove_bom` to verify the BOM removal functionality correctly handles various inputs.

4. **Error Handling:**  Includes `pytest.raises` for exception testing and added `assert` statements to check for expected results and None for error cases.

5. **Cleanup:** Added `teardown_module` to remove temporary files and the `test_dir` created, preventing issues with subsequent tests and ensuring a clean test environment.

6. **Data Creation:** The code now creates necessary dummy files/directories within the tests using `Pathlib` objects, as a prerequisite to the tests.

7. **Clearer Assertions:**  Use more specific assertions to verify the expected results of the file operations (e.g., content of files, existence of directories).

This improved solution significantly strengthens the test suite by addressing the key aspects of robust testing, including edge cases, error handling, and test data management. Remember to adjust the test directory path if you run the tests in another location. Remember to adapt file paths to match your specific test environment.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_file.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_file.py` from your terminal.

This will execute the tests and report the results.  Make sure that `hypotez` and its dependencies are properly installed in your environment. If needed, you may also need to add `hypotez` as a package, but this is often automatically done during the installation.
