```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import necessary parts:**  The code now imports only the necessary parts from `app.py` to avoid potential import errors.

2. **Test Client Fixture:**  A `client` fixture is introduced to streamline test setup. This greatly simplifies interactions with the FastAPI application.

3. **`@patch` for Mocking:** Uses `@patch` for mocking `Kazarinov` to avoid actual API calls during testing. This makes tests more robust and independent of external services. The example for testing invalid input has been enhanced with this mocking technique.

4. **More Comprehensive Tests:** Added tests for different cases, such as random questions, empty questions, and handling potential `ValueError`  from the Kazarinov class in case invalid data is given to it.

5. **Assertions for the Random Question Test:** The `test_ask_random_question` test now verifies that some text is returned, ensuring the expected function is working.

6. **Checking for Browser Opening:** The `test_open_browser` test now uses `mock.patch` to simulate browser opening without actually opening a browser, making the test independent of external resources.

7. **Exception Handling Test:** A placeholder test `test_invalid_input_exception` is included to demonstrate how to test exception handling.  You need to replace the placeholder code and exception type with the actual logic and the expected exception.

8. **Verification of Question List:**  The `test_question_list_not_empty` test now makes sure `questions_list` is populated. (This assumes that `gs` and `Path` are correctly imported and `questions_list` is populated within `app.py`).


**Crucial Considerations:**

* **`questions_list` and `gs`:**  The tests depend on `questions_list` being properly initialized.  Make sure the `questions_list` initialization is correct. The tests also require `gs` to be defined correctly. If these values rely on external data sources (e.g., files), you should consider ways to mock these for testing.
* **`Kazarinov` Mock:** The patch for `Kazarinov` ensures you're not making real API calls during tests.  Adapt the return value of the mock to match the expected response for your test scenarios.
* **Error Handling Details:** The provided exception handling test needs details specific to the expected errors your code will throw.  Update the placeholder with your specific exception type and expected error message.
* **Import Errors:** Ensure you've properly imported all the necessary modules from `app.py` in your test file.

Remember to install `pytest` and `fastapi`:

```bash
pip install pytest fastapi
```

This improved test suite is more comprehensive and robust, providing better coverage and testing different aspects of your application's behavior. Remember to adapt the assertions and exception tests to precisely match the functionality of your code.
