**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy `add_numbers` function:** A placeholder function `add_numbers` is created to demonStarte the testing structure. Replace this with your actual function.

2. **Fixtures for Test Data:** Fixtures (`positive_numbers`, `negative_numbers`, `mixed_numbers`, `non_numeric_input`) are defined to provide specific test data. This makes tests more organized and reusable.

3. **Clear Test Function Names:**  Test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_add_numbers_valid_input`).

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests cover various scenarios: positive numbers, negative numbers, mixed numbers, float numbers, zero inputs, and importantly, *invalid* input types (using `pytest.raises`).

5. **Edge Cases:** The code now includes tests for valid positive and negative inputs, demonStarting handling of different types of input values.

6. **Exception Handling:** The `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type` test explicitly checks for the `TypeError` raised by the function when non-numeric inputs are provided.  Crucially, it uses `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct exception is raised *and* the correct message is included in the exception.

7. **Docstrings:**  Docstrings are added to the test functions and fixtures, explaining their purpose and the data they provide. This is crucial for maintainability.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace** the dummy `add_numbers` function with your actual code.
2.  **Add** more tests as needed to cover all the functionalities of your function.
3.  **Run** the tests using `pytest`.  You should have `pytest` installed.  If not, run `pip install pytest`.

This improved solution provides a more robust and complete set of test cases for a function, illuStarting best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific requirements and structure of your code. Remember to remove the dummy code and use your actual input code.
