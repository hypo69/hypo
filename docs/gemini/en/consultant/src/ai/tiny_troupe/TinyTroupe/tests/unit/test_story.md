# Changes Made

*   Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
*   Added RST-style docstrings to functions (`test_story_start`, `test_story_start_2`, `test_story_continuation`).
*   Used `logger.info` for logging instead of `print`.
*   Improved comments to be more specific and in RST format.
*   Added a run() call in test_story_continuation to simulate world update.
