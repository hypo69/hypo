**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Invalid URL Handling:** Added `test_check_and_process_affiliate_products_invalid_input` to specifically test the case where the input URLs are invalid.  This now uses `pytest.raises` to assert that a `ValueError` is raised, which is crucial for robustness.

* **Empty Input Handling:** Added `test_check_and_process_affiliate_products_empty_input` and `test_process_affiliate_products_empty_input` to check what happens if an empty list of URLs is passed to the functions. This is a valuable edge case.

* **Clearer Test Names:**  The test names are more descriptive, clearly indicating the input and expected behavior.

* **More comprehensive `test_process_affiliate_products`:** The test now checks for both the length and the content of the `processed_products` list, ensuring that the retrieval and processing are working as expected.

* **Mock Side Effects:** The `side_effect` argument to `patch` is used to simulate the effect of `ensure_https` function, handling correctly when `prod_urls` is empty or contain valid URLs, returning a list of modified URLs (or an empty list when needed).

* **Import `urllib.parse`:** This was added to support proper URL handling in the tests.

* **Example of Invalid URLs:** Added `invalid_prod_urls` for testing invalid URLs, crucial in real-world scenarios.

This revised solution is more thorough, robust, and handles various edge cases, making it more reliable for testing the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class. Remember to replace `"src.suppliers.aliexpress.affiliated_products_generator"` with the correct path if needed. Also, consider adding more complex invalid input scenarios (e.g., URLs with missing parts, malformed data) in the `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_input` for even more comprehensive testing. Remember to adapt the error handling and assertions based on the actual expected exceptions in the functions you're testing.
