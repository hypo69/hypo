```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The most critical improvement is adding error handling.  The previous code silently returned the current directory if no marker files were found.  This is **extremely dangerous** in a project.  If the current file is not actually part of the project, your code will fail in unexpected ways later on.  The `FileNotFoundError` will now raise an exception if the project root cannot be found, allowing your calling code to handle the error gracefully.

* **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring now includes a `Raises` section explaining the potential `FileNotFoundError`. This is good practice for a robust function.

* **Style:**  Minor improvements to spacing and clarity within the code.

**How to Use:**

This `header.py` file should be placed at the `hypotez/src/fast_api` directory.  Then, in any other Python file in your `hypotez` project, you can import modules from the correct directory hierarchy without needing explicit paths.

**Example in a different file (e.g., `hypotez/src/fast_api/my_module.py`):**

```python
from fast_api.models import MyModel  # Import a model from a module in the project
```

This will correctly import `MyModel` if it is defined in a module within the `src/fast_api/` directory and its subdirectories in the properly identified project root directory.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Project Structure:**  This code relies on standard project layouts that include `pyproject.toml` and/or `requirements.txt`. If your project structure is radically different, you might need to adjust the `marker_files` tuple.

* **Error Handling in Your Application:** Your `fast_api` application should handle the potential `FileNotFoundError` by gracefully exiting or taking alternative actions.

With these changes, your code is more robust and provides a more reliable mechanism for discovering the project root.  This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and maintainability of your project, especially as it grows in size and complexity. Remember to run the code in your virtual environment to use this `header.py`.
