```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Attribute Testing:** The tests now cover all the module-level attributes (`__version__`, `__name__`, `__details__`, `__author__`).  This is crucial because these are the core components of the module.

2. **Clear Test Names:**  The test names are descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

3. **Data Types:**  The tests now explicitly check if the expected attributes are of the correct data type (string in this case).

4. **Edge Case for `__name__`:**  A test (`test_name_value`) is added to check if the `__name__` attribute correctly reflects whether the module is being run as a script (`__main__`) or imported as a module.

5. **Explicit Error Handling:**  The code is now designed for testing possible errors in the file.

6. **Import Correctly:** Tests are modified to import correctly.


7. **Restoration of __name__:** Added crucial `finally` block to restore the original value of `__name__` to avoid side effects on other tests.

8. **Docstring Test:** Added a test (`test_docstring`) to ensure the module has a docstring, although in this case it's fairly straightforward to verify.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.  This will execute all the tests in the file.

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive and robust coverage of the `version.py` module's functionality. Remember to place `test_version.py` in a directory that's on Python's module search path (e.g., the same directory as `version.py`).  If it isn't, you'll need to adjust the import paths in the tests to reflect the actual location.
