# Test for the MODE constant
def test_mode_constant():

    assert payload.MODE == 'dev', "MODE constant should be 'dev'."

# No other functions or classes are present in the provided code, so no further tests are necessary.
# If there are other functions or classes in the payload.py file, add tests for them here.
# For example, if there was a function to validate input, you could test its behavior with valid and invalid inputs.
