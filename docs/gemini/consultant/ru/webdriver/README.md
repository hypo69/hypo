```
Changes Made
```
- Added comprehensive docstrings to the `main` function and other functions as needed for better understanding.
- Added error handling (`try...except` block) to catch and log potential exceptions during WebDriver operations, preventing the script from crashing.  This is critical for robustness.
- Replaced `print` statements with more informative ones, using f-strings where appropriate.
- Improved parameter naming for clarity (e.g., `to_file` instead of `...`).
- Removed unnecessary comments.
- Removed duplicate import statements.
- Added a `finally` block to ensure the driver is properly closed, even if errors occur.
- Made the code more Pythonic and readable.  This includes better error handling and more concise code.
- Import `typing` for type hints.  Using type hints improves code readability.
- Included `Optional` type hint for possible `None` return values.
- Added `logger.error` calls to handle potential errors during driver operations.
