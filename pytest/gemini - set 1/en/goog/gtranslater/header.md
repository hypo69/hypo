**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests from the real file system, making them more reliable and reproducible.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more explicitly describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_get_project_root_valid_path`, `test_settings_loading_success`).

3. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Added tests for cases where files don't exist (`test_settings_loading_file_not_found`, `test_readme_loading_file_not_found`), and for handling invalid JSON in `settings.json` (`test_settings_loading_invalid_json`).

4. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed Here):**  The original code doesn't raise exceptions under the specific scenarios that you would use `pytest.raises`. For error handling, checking that the variable is `None` suffices.

5. **Mocking File System (tmp_path):**  Crucially, `tmp_path` from `pytest` is used to create temporary files for testing. This is essential for avoiding conflicts with existing files or the file system's state.

6. **Paths:**  Adjusted paths to be more robust and portable.  Crucially, the paths are now relative to the test file.

7. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test suite covers various aspects, including valid and invalid file paths, file existence checks, and handling of incorrect JSON.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/goog/gtranslater/header.py`.
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution addresses the previous shortcomings and provides a more robust and reliable test suite for the provided code. Remember to install the necessary dependencies (e.g., `packaging`).  If you have other modules used in the code, make sure you import them properly in the test file. Also, adapt the `Path` manipulations to be consistent with your project structure. Remember that the `root_dir` calculation needs adjustment according to your folder layout.
