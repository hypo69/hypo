**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_version_type`, `test_docstring_type`).

2. **Specific Assertions:**  Instead of just checking types, the tests now verify expected values or characteristics (e.g., presence of '.', checking for valid values).

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover the `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `MODE` variables, checking their types and appropriate values.

4. **Edge Case and Error Handling:**  The example `test_invalid_version_format` demonstrates how to test for exception handling using `pytest.raises`.  This is crucial for robustness. The `test_details_missing_key` shows how to test for missing keys in a dictionary.


5. **Missing Variable Handling:** The test `test_version_undefined` is an example of how to test for whether a variable is defined, which is vital because an undefined variable can cause unexpected errors.



**Crucial Considerations (and why you need to adapt):**

* **`__details__`:**  I've assumed `__details__` is a dictionary. If it's a different type (e.g., a list or something else), you'll need to adjust the tests accordingly (e.g., checking `__details__` values if it's a list or handling different exceptions if not a dictionary).

* **MODE:** The tests now check for a valid `MODE` string (either 'dev' or 'prod') which was missing in your original code example.

* **Missing Code:**  The provided code snippet from `aliexpress/gui/__init__.py` was very limited and didn't contain any functions or methods to test.  Real-world tests require testing the functions in the file.  Replace the `...` in your original file with the actual code (functions, classes, etc) so the test suite correctly covers that code.

* **Missing Imports:** The imports `from packaging.version import Version` are essential for the test to run correctly. Ensure you have the `packaging` library installed.


**How to Use the Tests:**

1. Save the tests in a Python file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_gui.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_aliexpress_gui.py` from your terminal in the same directory.  Pytest will automatically discover and run the tests.


Remember to replace the placeholder `...` in your original file with the actual code to create meaningful and robust test cases. This comprehensive example is a template, modify it to correctly test the contents of the file you provided.
