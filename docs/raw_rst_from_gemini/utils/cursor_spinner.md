This module provides a utility to show a spinning cursor in the console
to simulate a loading or waiting process.  The spinner cycles through
| (pipe), / (forward slash), - (hyphen), and \ (backslash) characters.

    Args:
        duration (float): The duration in seconds for the spinner to run. Defaults to 5.0.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if `duration` or `delay` are not numeric.

```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Docstrings:**  Improved docstrings to be more comprehensive and descriptive, including a concise summary and explicit parameter types.  The example usage in the docstring is also now more illustrative. Added a `Raises` section to the `show_spinner` docstring specifying the `TypeError` that can occur if the input values aren't numeric.


* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section. This is crucial!  Without it, a `TypeError` raised inside `show_spinner` (if the user passes non-numeric values) would crash the script. This prevents the entire program from stopping due to a potential `TypeError`.

* **Type Hinting (PEP 484):** Added type hints for `duration` and `delay` in `show_spinner` to improve code readability and maintainability. This isn't strictly required for Python 3.5+ but is strongly recommended for clarity and the ability to use static analysis tools.


* **Clearer Example Usage:** The example usage is now more focused on demonstrating how to call the function.

* **Docstring Example Use Cases:**  Example use cases within the docstrings are now more illustrative.


These changes make the code more robust, understandable, and Pythonic.  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is essential for ensuring that the example usage only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module). This keeps the script from printing examples when it's used in other parts of a larger program. Also, the error handling is crucial to prevent the script from crashing with unexpected input. Remember to install the `venv` package if you don't have it already (`pip install virtualenv`). Then create the virtual environment and activate it before running your script.
