```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  
# Therefore, no test functions can be written.

# This is a placeholder.  A real answer would have test functions 
# based on the Python code in the 'input_code' section.
# Example (if there were Python code):

# def test_example_function_valid_input():
#     """Tests the example function with valid input."""
#     # Replace with actual code and assertions
#     assert True  # Example assertion

# def test_example_function_invalid_input():
#     """Tests the example function with invalid input."""
#     # Replace with actual code and assertions
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         # Example function call that should raise an exception.
#         #  Replace this with your actual test code
#         example_function(invalid_input)

# def test_example_function_edge_case():
#     """Tests the example function with edge cases."""
#     # Replace with actual code and assertions
#     assert example_function(edge_case_input) == expected_output  
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is just an HTML structure.  There's no Python code to test.  Consequently, there are no functions, methods, or classes to test.  My previous response was a placeholder.  You **must** provide the Python code that interacts with this HTML to write meaningful tests.

**How to write tests if you had Python code:**

1. **Identify the Python code:**  You need the Python code that:
   - Loads, interacts with, or creates the HTML.
   - Defines functions, methods, or classes to test.

2. **Structure your tests:**  Follow the example structure I provided.
    - Define fixtures for any necessary test data.
    - Write test functions that call the Python code with different inputs.
    - Use `assert` statements to verify the expected output.
    - Use `pytest.raises` to verify that exceptions are raised when appropriate.

3. **Cover various scenarios:**
    - **Valid inputs:** Test normal, expected functionality with correct data.
    - **Invalid inputs:** Test cases where the input data is wrong or unexpected (e.g., incorrect types, missing values).
    - **Edge cases:** Test cases that are close to boundaries or limits of what your function can handle (e.g., maximum or minimum values, empty lists, etc.).

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's imagine you have a Python script that parses data from a webpage represented by a file (`popup.html`).  For that, your test file would need a way to call into your Python script.

```python
# Example (hypothetical) Python code (to be tested)

import requests
import bs4

def get_title_from_popup(html_file_path):
    try:
        with open(html_file_path, 'r') as f:
            html_content = f.read()
        soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
        title = soup.title.string
        return title
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None  # or raise an exception, as needed

# Example test file
import pytest
import bs4 # You'll need this library in your test file

def test_get_title_valid_input():
    html_file_path = "popup.html" # Replace with correct path
    expected_title = "hypotez"
    actual_title = get_title_from_popup(html_file_path)
    assert actual_title == expected_title
```

This example shows how to test a function that would access the HTML.  Provide the actual Python code to create more concrete tests.
