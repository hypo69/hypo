**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `sys`:** Added `import sys` to the top of the test file to allow manipulation of `sys.path` for testing.

2. **`test_set_project_root_valid_input`:** Now creates a temporary file to simulate a marker file.  Crucially, it cleans up the temporary file afterward.

3. **`test_set_project_root_invalid_input`:**  Creates a dummy directory structure to test the case where the marker files are not in the current directory but exist somewhere above.  More importantly, it cleans up the created dummy directory.

4. **`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`:** A new test case for the edge case where no marker files are provided.

5. **`test_set_project_root_root_in_syspath`:**  A crucial test to ensure that the root directory is properly added to `sys.path` if it's not already there. It restores the original `sys.path` after the test.


6. **Exception Handling Tests:** Included tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in `test_settings_json_file_not_found` and `test_README_md_file_not_found`. These are more robust because they use `pytest.raises` to ensure that the exceptions are handled properly.

7. **`test_settings_json_invalid_json`:** Tests handling of invalid JSON data in `settings.json`. This ensures the code can handle a common data validation error.


8. **Mock `gs.path`:** The tests now use `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `gs.path` to control the return value of `gs.path.root` when interacting with files.  This isolates the `header` module's behavior from dependencies like a potentially non-existent file system structure.  This is crucial for making the tests truly independent and reliable.  

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Place the `hypotez/src/goog` folder in the same directory or adjust the import statement. 
4.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


These improvements make the tests more comprehensive, robust, and less prone to unexpected failures.  The use of mocking (`patch`) is essential for creating reliable tests in situations involving external files. Remember to adjust the file paths if your project structure is different. Remember that if the `gs` module is not in the same directory, it is essential that its package structure is correct so Python can find it.
