# Instructions for Code Documentation Generation

# 1. Analyze the code: Understand the logic and actions performed by the given code block.

# 2. Create a step-by-step guide:
#    - Description: Explain what the code block does.
#    - Execution steps: Outline the sequence of actions in the code.
#    - Usage example: Provide a code example showing how to use this block in a project.

# 3. Formatting: Follow the structure in reStructuredText (RST):


# How to use this code block
# =========================================================================================

# Description
# --------------------------
# [Explain what the code does.]

# Execution steps
# --------------------------
# 1. [First step description.]
# 2. [Second step description.]
# 3. [Continue as necessary...]

# Usage example
# --------------------------
# .. code-block:: python

#    [Example usage code]

# 4. Avoid vague terms like "getting" or "doing." Be specific about what the code does, e.g., "checks," "validates," or "sends."
```

# Improved Code

Module for generating code documentation instructions.
=========================================================================================

This module provides instructions on how to document code blocks using reStructuredText (RST).

Example Usage
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming the instructions are in a variable called 'instructions')
    print(instructions)

How to document code blocks using reStructuredText (RST)
=========================================================================================

Description
--------------------------
This section describes the process of creating comprehensive documentation for Python code blocks.

Execution Steps
--------------------------
1. Analyze the Code: Carefully review the logic and actions performed by the code block.
2. Create a Step-by-Step Guide: Outline the steps involved in executing the code, including:
    - Description: Clearly explain what the code does.
    - Execution Steps: Detail the sequence of actions the code performs.
    - Usage Example: Provide a concise example of how to use the code block in a project.
3. Format Using reStructuredText (RST): Structure the documentation using reStructuredText for clarity and consistency, including section headers like "Description," "Execution Steps," and "Usage Example," and use code blocks for example code.  Avoid vague language.

Usage Example
--------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage of a hypothetical function
    result = some_function(arg1, arg2)
    print(result)
"""

    return instructions
```

# Changes Made

- Added a module docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Added a function `generate_documentation_instructions` to generate the RST-formatted documentation instructions.
- Removed unnecessary comments and examples.
- Improved the code clarity and structure.
- Incorporated detailed explanation comments using `#` for code blocks where improvements are required to align with the provided instructions
