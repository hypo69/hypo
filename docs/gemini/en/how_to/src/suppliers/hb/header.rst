How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). If found, it sets the project root, and adds it to Python's module search path (`sys.path`). It also loads project settings from `settings.json` and project documentation from `README.MD` if they exist.  Finally, it defines several variables storing project metadata, like name, version, author, and documentation, based on the loaded data.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules**: The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from the `packaging` library, and `Path` from the `pathlib` library.
2. **Define `set_project_root` function**: This function takes a tuple of marker file names as input.
3. **Determine the current file's path**: It gets the current file's path using `Path(__file__)`.
4. **Iterate through parent directories**: It iterates through the parent directories starting from the current file's directory.
5. **Check for marker files**: For each parent directory, it checks if any of the specified marker files exist within that directory.
6. **Set project root**: If a directory containing a marker file is found, it sets the `__root__` variable to that directory and exits the loop.
7. **Add project root to sys.path**: If the project root is not already in `sys.path`, it adds it to the beginning.
8. **Return project root**: The function returns the determined project root directory.
9. **Get project root**: It calls `set_project_root()` to retrieve the project's root directory and assigns the result to `__root__`.
10. **Load project settings**: It attempts to open and load settings from `settings.json` in the project root.  If not found or if the file is invalid JSON, it proceeds without settings.
11. **Load project documentation**: It attempts to open and read documentation from `README.MD` in the project root. If not found or if an error occurs, it proceeds without documentation.
12. **Define project metadata**: It defines variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__coffee__`) containing project information extracted from the settings file, falling back to default values if the settings file is missing or doesn't contain the relevant keys.



Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you've already imported the necessary modules)
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.header import set_project_root

    # Set project root,  this path would be replaced with a real path in a project
    project_root = set_project_root()

    # Access project metadata (e.g., name)
    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}") # assuming this has been declared in the header file
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")

    # ... further use of __root__, __project_name__, etc...
