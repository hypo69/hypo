# Adding edge case tests (not applicable without Supplier definition)


# Example with a mock (for more complex scenarios, use a mocking library like unittest.mock)
# In a production environment, you'd likely want a more robust mock
def test_login_with_mock_supplier():
	"""Tests login with a mock supplier object."""
	mock_supplier = Supplier()  # You need a Supplier class definition
	login(mock_supplier)  # This will call the real function with the mock object
	# Add assertions if you are expecting some action to be taken by the supplier's login method
	assert True # Assertion to indicate that the login function does not raise an error. This can be expanded based on expected behaviour
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The necessary import is now correct.

2. **Error Handling (TypeError):** The `test_login_invalid_input_type` test now explicitly checks for the `TypeError` raised by the `login` function if an inappropriate type is passed.  Crucially, it verifies the *error message* as well.

3. **`Supplier` Class:**  Crucially, a placeholder `Supplier` class is added.  In a real application, you would have this class defined to represent a supplier object. This change allows the other tests to function correctly and check for the expected type validation.


4. **Edge Cases (Important):** The example now shows that the tests need valid `Supplier` objects.  It doesn't make sense to test a function that expects a specific type without actually creating an object of that type.
   Edge cases for `login` are challenging to define without a more concrete `Supplier` class.


5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now cover more scenarios (including an invalid type).


6. **Clearer Assertions:** The `assert` statements are more specific, explaining the expected behavior in the test descriptions.

7. **Robustness:**  The tests are more robust because they are now testing for a TypeError as expected.

**To make the tests even more useful:**

- **`Supplier` Class:** Define a `Supplier` class with proper methods for authentication (e.g., `authenticate()`). This allows you to create mock objects and more realistic tests.

- **Mocking:** Use a mocking library like `unittest.mock` (or the more modern `pytest-mock`) for mocking the `Supplier` object to isolate the `login` function under test. This is a best practice, especially for complex logic that might interact with external services.

- **More Edge Cases:** Define edge cases specific to the `Supplier` class's methods (e.g., what happens if the credentials are invalid).


**Example using `pytest-mock` (recommended):**


```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.login import login

# ... (Supplier class definition from previous response)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("supplier_mock_return", [True, False]) #Example paramter
def test_login_with_mock_supplier(supplier_mock_return, monkeypatch): #Using monkeypatch instead of @patch
	"""Tests login with a mock supplier object."""

	mock_supplier = Supplier()  # You need a Supplier class definition

	def mock_authenticate(self):  # Example mock method in Supplier
	   return supplier_mock_return

	monkeypatch.setattr(Supplier, "authenticate", mock_authenticate) #Monkeypatch is better practice

	result = login(mock_supplier)
	assert result == supplier_mock_return
