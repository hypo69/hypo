**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `gspread` client and the `service_account` function. This is crucial for testing functions that interact with external resources (like Google Sheets) without actually accessing them.  This prevents errors and ensures tests run quickly.
* **Specific Test Cases:** Added tests for `get_by_title` to check both successful cases (spreadsheet exists) and failure cases (spreadsheet doesn't exist). This provides thorough test coverage.
* **`test_gspreadsheet_init_with_title`:** The test now verifies that the `get_by_title` method is not called unnecessarily. This is important because calling it unnecessarily could lead to errors or side effects.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Improved assertions to more directly check for the expected behavior.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests cover valid inputs, edge cases (spreadsheet not existing), and the `__init__` method.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have the `pytest` library installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_gspreadsheet.py`) in the same directory as your `gspreadsheet.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_gspreadsheet.py
    ```

Remember to replace placeholders like `'1ZcK74BCgWKVr4kODjPmSvjp5IyO0OxhXdbeHKWzLQiM'` with actual spreadsheet IDs for testing purposes.  Also, install the `gspread` library if you haven't already.  


```bash
pip install gspread
```


This significantly improved test suite provides better coverage and more reliable testing of the `GSpreadsheet` class. Remember to add more tests as needed to cover all aspects of your code. Remember to install the necessary dependencies, `gspread` and `pytest`.
