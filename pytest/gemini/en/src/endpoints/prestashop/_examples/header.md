**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_dir_root_exists`**: This test verifies that `dir_root` is a `Path` object and that the path actually exists. Crucial for ensuring the code can find the correct directory.

2. **`test_dir_root_path`**:  This test is essential. It directly compares the generated `dir_root` path with an expected path.  Crucially, it uses `Path.absolute()` for accurate comparison, regardless of the current working directory.  The `test_path` variable is a placeholder; replace it with a path you *know* should be the expected directory in your test environment.

3. **`test_path_appending_to_sys_path`**:  This test verifies that the `sys.path` appending logic works correctly.  It's important to *restore* `sys.path` to its original state after the test because altering `sys.path` globally can cause problems in other tests.   The comment regarding `dir_src` is important; you may want to test that too, but the current addition of the same path to `sys.path` twice can make this check problematic and less reliable.


4. **Example Tests (commented out)**: The commented-out tests demonstrate how to test other functions like `j_loads` and `save_text_file`. Replace these with your actual test cases.

5. **Exception Handling**:  The example now demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for `FileNotFoundError` (or other exceptions). Replace the placeholder test with appropriate tests for the handling of exceptions in functions like `save_text_file` and similar operations.

**How to Run Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the test code:** Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


**Crucially, before running the test, make sure to replace the placeholder `test_path` in `test_dir_root_path` with a path you know is correct on your system.**


This revised solution provides significantly improved test coverage and correctness for the given code, focusing on the crucial aspects of path handling and verification. Remember to replace the commented-out example tests with your actual tests. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functions and classes in the provided file.
