# Important:  This is crucial to avoid errors if your code imports anything
# from src.printer that might have side effects in the tests.
# This prevents unintentional interactions between the tests.
# You might need to add mocks for other functions from src.printer
# if they are used in the pprint function.



# --- Additional tests (if any other functions are present) ---

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `pprint`:** The original code didn't need the `pprint` import from `sys`.
2. **`pytest.MonkeyPatch`:** The provided code doesn't actually use the `pprint` function from the `src.printer` module, so I've used `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to mock the `pprint` function within the tests to isolate them and make them more robust.  This allows you to control what `pprint` does during the test.
3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better describe the input and expected outcome.
4. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for `None` and empty string inputs.
5. **No External Dependencies:** The tests now rely only on the `example_pprint.py` file itself.
6. **Capturing Output:** Modified the tests to capture the output from the `pprint` function using `pytest.MonkeyPatch`.  This lets you check if the correct values are being printed.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_example_pprint.py`).
3. Run `pytest test_example_pprint.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.

**Crucial Considerations (For Real-World Applications):**

* **Proper `src.printer` Mocks:** If the `pprint` function in `src.printer` interacts with external systems (e.g., files, network), you'll need to mock those as well using `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to ensure tests don't have unwanted side effects.
* **Error Handling:** If `pprint` is supposed to raise exceptions for invalid input, add tests to verify that those exceptions are handled correctly.
* **Complex Logic:** If `pprint` performs complex calculations or interactions with data structures, you will need more sophisticated tests to cover all the possible scenarios.  Create test data for various cases.

Remember to replace `src.printer` with the actual path if your structure is different.  This example prioritizes testing the core function's behaviour, not the external effects.
