**Explanation of Improvements and Key Considerations:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for empty input, which is crucial to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.  This addresses a critical weakness in the previous version.
* **Mixed Valid/Invalid URLs:** The `prod_urls` fixture now contains a mix, allowing testing of cases where only some URLs are valid.
* **Explicit Exception Handling:** Included `pytest.raises` for testing the `process_affiliate_products` method with an invalid URL, confirming the expected exception.
* **No Details Case:** Added a test to ensure the `process_affiliate_products` method handles cases where `retrieve_product_details` returns an empty list.
* **Mock Side Effects:**  Using `side_effect` in `patch` allows testing with different exceptions in a cleaner, more controlled manner.

* **Mocking `ensure_https`:**  Critically, the example `ensure_https` was a placeholder.  Now a `side_effect` is used to make this a proper test.  
* **Realistic Mock Data:**  The mock data for `retrieve_product_details` is now properly constructed to return a meaningful `SimpleNamespace`.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more explicit about the scenarios being tested.
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings for more descriptive test purpose explanations.



These improvements make the tests more robust and comprehensive, covering more potential issues and edge cases. Remember to adjust the test data and expected results based on the actual implementation of the functions and their dependencies. The example uses `requests` for mock HTTP, if you were using a real HTTP library you could mock `requests.get` with pytest's mocking utilities to provide realistic URLs in the test suite.


Remember to install the necessary libraries, especially `pytest` and `requests`:

```bash
pip install pytest requests
```
