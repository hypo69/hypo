```

**Usage Guide:**

This Python file (`hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/__init__.py`) serves as an initialization module for a section of code related to OpenAI models.  It's likely part of a larger project, likely focused on training or interacting with OpenAI models within a `hypotez` application.

**Key elements and how to use them:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This line defines a constant, `MODE`, which is set to the string 'dev'.  This is likely a configuration variable used to distinguish between development, testing, and production environments.  You would change this variable in the project's configuration to switch between environments if necessary.  For example, in a production setting, you might set it to `'prod'` or `'staging'`.

* **`from .training import OpenAIModel`:** This line imports the `OpenAIModel` class from a module named `training` within the same directory (`hypotez/src/ai/openai/model`). This means that the `OpenAIModel` class—presumably defining how to train or interact with an OpenAI model—is available for use in other parts of your project.

**Example Usage (Conceptual):**

```python
# In another Python file within the project.  Assume you have the necessary imports.

from hypotez.src.ai.openai.model import OpenAIModel

# Create an instance of the OpenAIModel
model = OpenAIModel()

# ... (e.g., train the model, make predictions, etc.) ...

# Example:
# model.train(data)
# predictions = model.predict(input_text)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/training.py`:** The code shown here does *not* include the actual implementation of `OpenAIModel`. The `training.py` file (presumably in the same directory) would contain the class definition and its methods (like `train` and `predict` in the example usage). You'll need to refer to that file for complete details of the model's functions.

* **Project Structure:** This code assumes a specific project structure.  Understanding the overall structure of your `hypotez` application will help you know where to use and how to implement specific model functions.

* **OpenAI API Key:**  Since this code deals with OpenAI, you likely need to manage an API key.  This is often done through environment variables or configuration files.  The `OpenAIModel` class should handle authentication.


In summary, this `__init__.py` file acts as an import module, making the `OpenAIModel` available for other parts of your program.  You will need to look at `hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/training.py` for the implementation details.
