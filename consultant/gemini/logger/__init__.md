**Improvements and explanations:**

1. **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is a `try...except` block around `get_project_root()`.  If the function can't find the project root (e.g., the marker files are missing), it raises a `FileNotFoundError`. This is *much* better than silently continuing with a wrong `__root__` path, which will cause downstream errors that are difficult to trace.  The `exit(1)` is important as well - it signals a non-zero exit code to the calling program, indicating that something failed.

2. **Clearer Error Message:** The `FileNotFoundError` message now gives a better indication of the problem.

3. **`sys.path` insertion *after* try-except:** Placing `if __root__ not in sys.path:` *after* the `try-except` block is essential, because if `get_project_root()` raises an exception, `__root__` will not be properly set and attempting to add it to `sys.path` will cause an error.

4. **Explicit `return` statement:** The `get_project_root` function now has an explicit `return` statement, making the function logic more readable.


5. **Removed unnecessary `__root__` assignment and print statement**: The code already declares `__root__` as a Path, so re-assigning it (and printing it) is redundant.

6. **Import `packaging.version`:** The `packaging` library is used for robust version handling, which is important in any project that deals with Python packages and versions. This import is included now.

**How to use this improved code:**


```python
# Example usage (in another Python file)
import logger

# ... do your stuff
```

This improved version is now more robust and informative. It will gracefully handle cases where the project root cannot be determined, preventing silent failures and making debugging much easier. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install packaging
```
