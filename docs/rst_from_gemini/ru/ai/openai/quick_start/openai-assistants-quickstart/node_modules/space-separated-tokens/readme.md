Parse and stringify space-separated tokens, as used in HTML `class` attributes,
according to the [WHATWG spec][spec].  This package is particularly useful
when working with [hast][].

## Install

This package is ESM only.

In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+), install with npm:

```bash
npm install space-separated-tokens
```

In Deno with `esm.sh`:

```typescript
import {parse, stringify} from 'https://esm.sh/space-separated-tokens@2';
```

In browsers with `esm.sh`:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {parse, stringify} from 'https://esm.sh/space-separated-tokens@2?bundle';
</script>
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {parse, stringify} from 'space-separated-tokens';

const parsed = parse(' foo\tbar\nbaz  ');
console.log(parsed); // Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

const stringified = stringify(['foo', 'bar', 'baz']);
console.log(stringified); // Output: 'foo bar baz'
```

## API

This package exports the `parse` and `stringify` functions.  No default export.

### `parse(value: string): string[]`

Parses a space-separated string into an array of strings.  Consecutive
spaces are treated as a single separator.

### `stringify(values: (string | number)[]): string`

Serializes an array of strings or numbers into a space-separated string.

**Important Note:** Empty or whitespace-only values cannot be represented.

## Types

This package is fully typed with TypeScript.  No additional types are exported.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+, Deno, and modern browsers.

**Improvements:**

* **Clearer description:**  The purpose and use cases are better explained.
* **TypeScript-style comments:**  Added type annotations to the function signatures.
* **Improved example:** Demonstrates `parse` and `stringify` use with more clarity.
* **Important Note:**  Added a crucial note about empty/whitespace-only values.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary comments and formatting for better readability.
* **Proper Markdown:** Used correct Markdown syntax.
* **Link Placeholder:** Replaced placeholder links with actual placeholders.  You need to replace these with the real links.


This revised README is more concise, clear, and better suited for use as documentation. Remember to replace the placeholder links with actual links from the package. Remember to update the placeholders to point to the actual URLs. Also consider adding a table of contents at the top.
