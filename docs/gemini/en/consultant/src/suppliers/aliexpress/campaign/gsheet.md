## Changes Made

- Added missing imports: `from src.logger import logger`
- Added detailed RST-formatted docstrings to all functions and methods, following Python docstring standards.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` for file reading as instructed.
- Replaced vague comments with specific terms.
- Added `logger.error` for error handling instead of relying on overly broad `try-except` blocks.
- Corrected variable names and type hints to align with the style guidelines.
- Removed unnecessary and commented out parts of the code.
- Added missing `exc_info=True` parameter to `logger.error` calls for better error reporting.
- Improved the formatting of the `set_campaign_worksheet` function to handle campaign data vertically.
