# Add more specific test cases for Playwrid methods if available

#     """Tests launching a browser through the Playwrid class."""
#     # Arrange:  Set up initial conditions for the test

#         # Assert: Verify the browser was launched successfully. 
#         # For example, check if a browser window is open or if the driver is initialized.
#         assert True  # Replace with appropriate assertion
#     except Exception as e:

#     # Test invalid input (e.g., string) for headless mode
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         playwrid_instance.set_headless_mode("invalid")

#     assert "Invalid configuration" in str(excinfo.value)

# Add more test cases as needed for other functions or methods in the Playwrid class.
# Note that the above examples for Playwrid are placeholders, and you need to fill in specific methods and error handling according to the actual class implementation.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`playwrid_instance` fixture:**  Created a fixture to create a `Playwrid` instance once, making the tests more efficient.

2. **`test_mode_value`:** Simple test to verify the `MODE` constant.

3. **Placeholder tests for `Playwrid`:** Added placeholder tests for the `Playwrid` class.  Crucially, these now show *how* to test methods. You must replace the placeholder comments with the actual methods in your `Playwrid` class.

4. **Exception Handling:** The `test_playwrid_set_headless_mode` example demonStartes using `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.  You'd adapt this pattern for other potential errors.

5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The example demonStartes testing both valid and invalid inputs to a method. You should add tests to address various edge cases and invalid data that `Playwrid`'s methods might encounter.

6. **Clarity and Structure:** The tests are now better organized, with clear test function names and comments explaining the purpose of each test.

**Before running these tests:**

- **Ensure the `Playwrid` class exists and has the necessary methods** (like `launch_browser`, `set_headless_mode`, etc.).  The code you provided only shows `Playwrid` _definition_ , but lacks the _implementation_ of relevant methods.
- **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
- **Replace placeholders:**  The placeholder comments (`# ...`) need to be replaced with actual code snippets to test the real methods of the `Playwrid` class.
- **Adapt the assertions:** The placeholder assertions (`assert True`) need to be updated to match the expected results of the tests you are writing.  For example, if `launch_browser` returns a `WebDriver` instance, you would assert that `isinstance(playwrid_instance.launch_browser(), webdriver.WebDriver)`
