```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe # <- venv win
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""" module: src.goog """

""" Google API.
ИИ Generative AI находится в src.ai."""

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__ 

from .spreadsheet import SpreadSheet


#Add docstrings to the module if possible
def __init__():
	"""Initializes the goog module."""
	pass
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Missing Docstring:** The original code lacked a docstring for the `__init__.py` file itself. This is crucial for documentation.  I've added a `__init__` function with a docstring to demonstrate proper initialization, though it's currently empty.


2. **PEP 8 Compliance (minor):** While not strictly necessary, adding a docstring for the `__init__` function adheres to PEP 8, improving code readability and maintainability.


3. **Function to handle module initialization:** The original code was missing an `__init__` function. Though simple, having one with a docstring adds more structure and clarity to the module.


**How to use the improvements:**

You can now use the `__init__` function in your code if needed, though currently the function is empty. If you have methods to be used in the goog module's initialization, you would place the implementation inside the __init__ function, as well as adding further docstrings to provide descriptions and usage information for those methods.

**Example of a more complete `__init__.py`:**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe # <- venv win
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""" module: src.goog """

""" Google API.
ИИ Generative AI находится в src.ai."""

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__ 

from .spreadsheet import SpreadSheet


def __init__():
    """Initializes the goog module.  
    This function is currently empty.  Add initialization logic here if needed."""
    pass

def get_version():
    """Returns the version of the goog module."""
    return __version__

def some_function():
    """This is an example function demonstrating how to add logic in __init__."""
    print("Some logic is here.")


# Example Usage (demonstrates how to import and use the functions in your code).
#if __name__ == "__main__":
#	print(get_version())
#	some_function()
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual initialization logic if applicable.  Adding `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in a way that won't hinder import behavior in other parts of your application.  Place this code block within the `__init__.py` file, this way the code inside the block only runs when the `__init__.py` file is executed directly (not when imported as a module).  The example above shows a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. Note: This may not be desirable in all cases, so carefully consider your project's requirements.
