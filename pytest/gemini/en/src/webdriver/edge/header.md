```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Created fixtures (`dummy_pyproject_toml`, `dummy_requirements_txt`, `dummy_git_folder`, `dummy_settings_json`) to manage test data generation more cleanly.  `tmp_path` from `pytest` is used for creating temporary files/directories.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests covering various scenarios (valid inputs, no files, parent directories, multiple marker files).

3. **Error Handling (FileNotFoundError):**  Included tests for cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might not exist.  These are crucial edge cases and are now tested explicitly.  **Crucially, the tests are now using `pytest.raises` to assert the expected exceptions.**

4. **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names, added comments, and used more descriptive test names.

5. **`monkeypatch` for `sys.path`:**  Added tests to check how the function correctly interacts with `sys.path` and to handle the case where the path is already present in `sys.path`.

6. **Clearer Fixture Purpose:**  Added docstrings to the fixtures to better understand their purpose.

7. **Isolated Tests:** All tests are now independent.

This revised solution is significantly more robust and covers a wider range of possible situations, providing much better test coverage for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adapt the test for `README.MD` similarly, including error handling and specific edge cases. Remember to install the `pytest` library using `pip install pytest`.  Run your tests with `pytest`.
