How to Use the hypo69 Module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
The `hypo69` module contains endpoints for developers.  It comprises three key components: a chatbot model, a code assistant, and a dialogue parsing module (still in early development).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the module:** To use the `hypo69` endpoints, you first need to import the necessary functions or classes within the module.

2. **Interact with the endpoints:**  Specific functions within the module provide access to the different features.  For example:
    * `small_talk_bot`: Allows interaction with a chatbot based on a conversational AI model.
    * `code_assistant`: Enables training the model on code from a project, likely involving input and data preparation.
    * `psychologist_bot`: (Early development) Facilitates parsing dialogue data.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example interaction with the small_talk_bot (replace with actual import)
    from src.endpoints.hypo69 import small_talk_bot

    # Example of sending a user input and receiving a response (replace with appropriate function parameters)
    response = small_talk_bot.respond("Hello, how are you?")
    print(response)
