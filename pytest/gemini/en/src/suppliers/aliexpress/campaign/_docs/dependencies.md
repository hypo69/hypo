**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mock Dependencies:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `AliCampaignGoogleSheet`. This is *essential* for unit testing `AliPromoCampaign` without needing a running Google Sheets API.  Replace `"hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_promo_campaign.AliCampaignGoogleSheet"` with the actual module path.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test descriptions now accurately reflect what's being tested (e.g., "invalid campaign ID").

3. **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used to assert specific exceptions are raised when invalid data is provided.  This is crucial for robust testing.  The exception messages are checked for correctness.

4. **Example Fixtures:** Shows how fixtures can be created (replace `valid_campaign_data` with the actual fixture logic).

5. **Placeholder Imports:** The code now has placeholder imports like `from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_promo_campaign import AliPromoCampaign` (replace with the actual path to the file). This is essential; otherwise, you'll get import errors.


**To Run the Tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the placeholder import statements and the placeholder class name (`AliPromoCampaign`) with the actual paths and names from your codebase.
2. **Install pytest:** If you haven't already, install pytest:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
3. **Save:** Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_ali_promo_campaign.py` in the `_pytest` directory).
4. **Run the Tests:** Execute the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_ali_promo_campaign.py
   ```


This improved solution provides a much more robust and realistic set of test cases that will help you thoroughly validate your code's behavior.  Remember to adapt the tests to the specific error handling and data structures used in your actual code.  Don't forget to replace the placeholder `valid_input` with the actual inputs you need to test.
