**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock the `Kazarinov` class and its `ask` method.  This is crucial for testing the `app` without needing a running external API or database. The `mock_kazarinov_response` function defines the mock behavior, returning different responses for various inputs.
* **`@pytest.mark.asyncio`:**  The `async def` functions are now decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to indicate that they are asynchronous tests. This is essential when working with FastAPI endpoints that involve asynchronous operations.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are made more specific to check for the presence of expected strings in the response body, ensuring that the correct output is generated.
* **`test_app` Fixture:** A fixture `test_app` creates a FastAPI app instance within the test function and initializes necessary components, simplifying testing. It injects the mock Kazarinov instance.
* **`mock_kazarinov` Fixture:** The `mock_kazarinov` fixture provides a mock Kazarinov object, allowing the tests to control the response.
* **Error Handling:** Added a basic test for invalid input (empty question), showcasing how to handle different cases.
* **Example Template Path:** The `Jinja2Templates` now takes a dummy path instead of a real template directory.  This is critical for running tests without external template files.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Install necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest fastapi uvicorn pytest-asyncio pydantic
    ```
2.  Create dummy placeholder files (if needed) for static and templates:
    Create empty files at `dummy_template_path` and `dummy_static_path` in the current working directory or the correct location for your dummy files.


3.  Replace `'dummy_template_path'` and `'dummy_static_path'` with the correct dummy folder paths in the `test_app` fixture.

4.  Run the tests:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

This revised solution provides a much more robust and complete set of test cases for the `app.py` code, addressing the core requirements and using best practices for pytest testing. Remember to adapt the assertions and test cases to reflect the specific logic and expected behavior of your actual application. Remember to adjust the dummy paths to match your actual file structure.
