""" This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.  It includes error handling and logging for robust operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Handles file not found and read errors.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')  # or None if failed

    >>> data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

## <algorithm>

**save_video_from_url(url, save_path):**

1. **Input:** URL, save path
2. **Establish Connection:**  Create an `aiohttp` session to the given URL.
3. **Error Handling (HTTP):** Check for HTTP errors using `raise_for_status()`.  If an HTTP error occurs, log the error and return `None`.
4. **Directory Creation:** Create necessary parent directories for the save path using `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
5. **Download Chunking:** Read the video content in chunks (8192 bytes).
6. **Write Chunked Data:** Write each chunk to the `save_path` asynchronously using `aiofiles`.
7. **Error Handling (File System):**
    * Check if file exists after download; if not, log and return `None`.
    * Check if file is empty (0 bytes); if so, log and return `None`.
8. **Return Success:** Return the `Path` object representing the saved file.


**get_video_data(file_name):**

1. **Input:** File Name
2. **File Existence:** Check if the file exists. If not, log an error and return `None`.
3. **Open File:** Open the file in binary read mode (`rb`).
4. **Read Data:** Read the entire content of the file into a bytes object.
5. **Return Data:** Return the bytes object containing the video data.
6. **Error Handling (File System):** Catch and log any exceptions that occur during file reading.  Return `None`.



**Data Flow:**

The `main` function calls `save_video_from_url`.  The returned path, or `None` on error, is used for logging success or failure.  The `get_video_data` function is independent, and used to read data from the saved file.


Example:

```
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|  save_video     |---|   get_video_data   |---|    main         |
|  from_url(...)  |   |    (...)         |---|   (...)         |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
      |                       |                      |
      V                       V                      V
  URL, save_path ->    File Name  ->     Result    -> Print output
                                     
```

```
## <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client, used for downloading the video.
- `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file I/O operations for saving the video to the file system.
- `pathlib`: For working with file paths in a platform-independent way (crucial for different OS).
- `typing`: Used for type hints (`Optional[Path]`).
- `asyncio`: The core for async operations.
- `logger`: Custom logger likely defined in a `src.logger` module (not shown in this file); this imports logging functionality.  Its presence suggests a structured logging system is present in the project.

**Classes:**

- No classes are defined in this file.

**Functions:**

- `save_video_from_url(url, save_path)`:  This function takes a URL and a save path as input.  It downloads the video in chunks asynchronously using `aiohttp` and saves it to the specified location. Critical error handling is included, returning `None` for failure cases (network errors, file not found, or empty file). The use of `aiofiles` makes it a better choice than `requests` for large files. 
- `get_video_data(file_name)`: This function reads the binary data of a video file from the given `file_name`.  It handles potential errors during file access.  Its purpose is to retrieve the video data after it has been saved.
- `main()`: A simple function to orchestrate the saving of the video, showing a basic usage example.


**Variables:**

- `MODE = 'dev'`: This global variable is used to control behavior (e.g., logging level), but its implementation is not shown. It's common to use this in larger projects with more complex configurations.


**Potential Errors and Improvements:**

- **Robust Error Handling:** The use of `try...except` blocks is good for handling potential errors, but adding more specific exception types might improve error reporting. For example, `IOError` might be a more suitable catch-all.
- **Download Progress:**  Adding a progress bar or some sort of feedback while downloading would improve user experience.
- **HTTP Redirection:** While the code checks for HTTP errors, it lacks handling of redirects (e.g., a redirect to another URL).  Checking for the appropriate status codes during the redirection would be necessary.
- **URL Validation:** Adding validation to the URL, checking its format or valid protocol, would improve robustness.
- **Content-Length Check:** Checking the `Content-Length` header of the response can prevent unexpected situations (e.g., a large file being partially downloaded).

**Relationship with Other Parts of the Project:**

The `logger` import from `src.logger` indicates a relationship with other parts of the project, likely a logging configuration file or class.   The usage of `src.logger` shows this module is part of a larger project structure, making use of an existing logger.
