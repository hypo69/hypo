# desktop.ini Documentation

## Overview

This file is a Windows `desktop.ini` file.  It's used to control the way a folder appears in Windows Explorer, such as by setting icons and other visual attributes.  The contents are in INI format,  typically used to store configuration settings. This specific example sets the icon for the folder.

## File Structure

The file is formatted using the INI file structure, containing sections and key-value pairs.  Within the INI format, the specific parameters are defined.

## Sections

### `[.ShellClassInfo]`

This section defines the icon resource for the folder.

**Parameters:**

- `IconResource=C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\SHELL32.dll,300`: Specifies the path to the icon resource file (`SHELL32.dll`) and the icon index (300).


### `[ViewState]`

This section is used to control the folder view state.

**Parameters:**

- `Mode=`: Stores the folder mode.
- `Vid=`: Stores the folder view ID.
- `FolderType=Generic`: Stores the folder type.


## Data Types

This section describes the data types used within the `desktop.ini` file. Note that these types aren't declared in the Python sense, but rather reflect how Windows interprets the data.

- **String**: Used for paths, values, and text.
- **Integer**: Used for icon indexes.
- **Keywords**:  Sections like `[.ShellClassInfo]` and `[ViewState]` are identified as keywords.


## Example Usage

The example `desktop.ini` file sets the icon for the corresponding folder.  This would typically be used to apply a custom icon to a folder instead of the default icon associated with the file type or folder contents.
