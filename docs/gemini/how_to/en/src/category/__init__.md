## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/category/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/category/__init__.py`, is the initialization file for the `category` module within the `hypotez` project.  It sets a mode variable and imports a `Category` class.

**File:** `hypotez/src/category/__init__.py`

**Purpose:** Initializes the `category` module.

**Key Elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This line assigns the string `'dev'` to the variable `MODE`.  This variable likely controls the behavior of the application, potentially switching between development and production modes.  This is a crucial setting for determining configurations like logging levels or other application behaviors.

* **`from .category import Category`:** This imports the `Category` class from a submodule named `category` within the current directory (`hypotez/src/category`).  This import is essential to make the `Category` class usable in other parts of your project.


**How to use:**

1. **Import the `Category` class:**  In other modules, import the class like this:

```python
from hypotez.src.category import Category
```

2. **Create a `Category` object:**  You can now use the `Category` class to create instances:

```python
my_category = Category(...)
```

   The exact arguments you pass to the `Category` constructor will depend on the definition of the `Category` class within the `hypotez/src/category.py` file (not shown in the provided code).  This is where you would configure the category object.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.category import Category

# Assuming Category takes a name as an argument
my_category = Category("Technology")

# Now you can use the my_category object
# ...
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`hypotez/src/category.py`:**  The provided code only shows the `__init__.py` file.  Crucially, you need the `category.py` file to define the `Category` class itself, including its attributes, methods, and initialization parameters.  The example above assumes `Category` takes a name for example.


* **Mode (`MODE = 'dev'`):**  The `MODE` variable's significance depends on how your application utilizes this variable.  Understanding its purpose in your project is necessary to fully utilize this functionality.  Potential uses include:
    * **Configuration:** Selecting different configuration files based on the mode.
    * **Logging:** Different logging levels or log file destinations.
    * **API Endpoints:** Selecting specific API endpoints.


This usage guide assumes a standard Python module structure.  Adjust the import paths if your project structure is different.  Always consult the actual implementation of the `Category` class within `hypotez/src/category.py` for detailed usage.
