How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block imports the `PrestaShop` class from a module named `api` within the `prestashop` subdirectory of the `endpoints` package.  It sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code initializes a variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value `'dev'` to it. This variable likely controls the execution mode (e.g., development, production) of the PrestaShop API interaction.

2. It imports the `PrestaShop` class from a module named `api` located within the `prestashop` subdirectory.  The import statement is using relative imports, implying the `api` module contains definitions for interacting with a PrestaShop API.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import PrestaShop

    

    # Example usage, assuming PrestaShop class methods exist:
    presta_shop_instance = PrestaShop()
    # ... (add code to call PrestaShop methods here, e.g.,
    #    presta_shop_instance.get_products()
    #    response = presta_shop_instance.create_product(...) )
    # ...
```
