```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  The import statement is crucial for `pytest` functionality.

2. **Mocking:** The code now uses `mocker.patch` to mock the `_get_products` method (or any other method that interacts with external services). This is essential for unit testing, allowing you to control the return values and verify that the `PrestaShop` class interacts with the mock as expected, without needing an actual PrestaShop API.  The mocks are crucial for isolating tests.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_products_valid_input`).

4. **Edge Cases:** The example now includes a test (`test_get_products_empty_input`) for an empty return from the mocked API call.

5. **Exception Handling:** A test (`test_get_products_invalid_input`) demonstrates how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.  This is very important for robustness.

6. **`assert_called_once()`:** This is added to ensure that the mocked method is indeed called.

7. **Data-driven Tests (Optional):**  For more complex scenarios, consider using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to create data-driven tests and run the same test logic against multiple sets of inputs.


**Crucially:** Replace `_get_products` with the actual method name in your `PrestaShop` class.  Add tests for all important methods and attributes. Provide realistic inputs, not just dummy values. Test exceptions raised by the API interaction or by your implementation.  Thorough testing requires understanding your `PrestaShop` class's API calls and the types of errors it might encounter.
