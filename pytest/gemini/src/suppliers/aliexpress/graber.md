**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `Driver` and `Context` classes using `unittest.mock`. This isolates the `Graber` class's behavior from the actual web driver interactions, significantly improving testability.  Crucially, it creates `MockDriver` and `MockContext` classes.


2. **Fixture for `driver`:** A `pytest.fixture` named `driver` is defined to provide a mock `Driver` instance to the tests, making them more organized and readable.


3. **Fixture for `graber`:** A fixture `graber` is created. This sets up a `Graber` instance in a controlled way, using the `driver` fixture.


4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The included test cases now target:
    * **`__init__`:** Checks the initialization of `Graber` with different scenarios, including a custom `supplier_prefix` (using `Context`)
    * **`execute_locator`:**  Checks a potential exception that can occur when `execute_locator` is called. This is a critical step as it exposes potential errors arising from interactions with the web driver.




**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`

This improved solution addresses the essential aspects of writing robust `pytest` tests, focusing on mocking dependencies to create isolated tests, and creating comprehensive test cases. Remember to adapt the mocks and fixtures to accurately reflect the actual dependencies of your code. This provides a much more comprehensive and reliable way to ensure the correct functioning of the `Graber` class. Remember to adapt the mocking strategies to your specific use case, replacing the mocks with realistic dependencies as needed, particularly for the `execute_locator` handling and other relevant methods.
