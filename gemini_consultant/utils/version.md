**Explanation of the code and potential improvements:**

This code defines several variables, likely intended for metadata about the Python module.  The current format is fine for basic metadata, but there are potential improvements to make it more Pythonic and useful.


**Possible Improvements and Considerations:**

* **`__doc__` and `__details__`:**  Empty strings aren't very helpful.  Consider filling these with meaningful descriptions.  `__doc__` should be a concise summary, while `__details__` could contain more detailed information about the module's purpose, functionality, or usage examples.

* **`__copyright__`:** The format is good, but could be slightly better structured as a multi-line string using triple quotes for better readability:

```python
__copyright__ = """
Copyright (c) 2024 hypo69

This project is licensed under the MIT License.
See the MIT License for details.

Commercial use of the code is prohibited without prior permission from the authors.
"""
```

* **`__cofee__`:**  This is a good way to solicit support, but consider making it a function that returns the string, or a URL, rather than a literal string:

```python
def get_coffee_link():
    return "https://boosty.to/hypo69"


__cofee__ = get_coffee_link()
```

   This allows the code to remain cleaner if you need to refactor the way the link is retrieved or handled in the future.


* **Explicit type hints (optional):**   Adding type hints to the variables is good practice, especially for larger projects:

```python
__version__: str = 'v1.1'
__doc__: str = "" # Or a more descriptive string
__details__: str = ""
__author__: str = "hypo69"
__copyright__: str = """ ... """
__cofee__: str = "https://..."  # Or use the function.
```

* **Use of `__init__.py` (if applicable):**  If this is part of a package, place this `version.py` file inside a directory and create an `__init__.py` file within the same directory. This will turn the directory into a package, and you can import `version` from there. `__init__.py` can also contain an `__all__` variable to explicitly control what can be imported from this package, if necessary.



**Example (incorporating some of the suggestions):**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe # <- venv win
""" module: src.utils """
__version__: str = 'v1.1'
__doc__: str = "Utility functions for the Hypotez project."
__details__: str = "This module contains various helpful functions."
__author__: str = "hypo69"
__copyright__ = """
Copyright (c) 2024 hypo69

See the MIT License for details.

"""
__cofee__ = "https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

By implementing these enhancements, you'll create a more maintainable and robust metadata system for your module. Remember to adapt the changes to fit your specific project structure and needs.
