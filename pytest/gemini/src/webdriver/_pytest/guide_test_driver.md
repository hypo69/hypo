```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `DriverBase` class's `execute` method. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing dependencies on external resources.
* **Clear Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to catch specific exceptions like `TypeError` and `ValueError`, asserting that the correct error message is produced for invalid input.  This makes the tests more robust.
* **Valid Input Tests:** Added tests for valid inputs to demonstrate successful method execution.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests now explicitly cover cases with empty payloads, non-integer coordinates, and incorrect data types, which are essential for robust testing.
* **Specific Error Messages:** The error messages are now more descriptive and informative about the type of invalid input encountered.
* **Import:** Corrected the import statement to `from webdriver.driver import DriverBase` assuming your `DriverBase` class is in `webdriver/driver.py`

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the above code as `test_driver.py` in a `tests` directory alongside your `webdriver` directory.
3.  Run `pytest tests/test_driver.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution is more comprehensive, addressing the critical aspects of writing robust `pytest` tests. Remember to replace placeholders like `"webdriver.driver"` with your actual module path. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual implementation of the `DriverBase` class.  If there are other methods or attributes in `DriverBase`, you should add similar test functions for them.  Crucially, you need to add the `driver.py` file to the project. The tests above are now valid for testing the `driver_payload`, `scroll`, and `locale` functions.
