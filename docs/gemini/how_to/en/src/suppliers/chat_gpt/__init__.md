How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/__init__.py` module

This module, located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/__init__.py`, provides access to functionality related to interacting with ChatGPT, likely through a Google Sheets integration.

**Key elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:**  This variable likely sets the operational mode of the module.  `'dev'` suggests it's in development or a testing configuration.  This setting may affect the way the module interacts with external services or the level of logging.

* **`from .gsheet import GptGs`:**  This line imports the `GptGs` class from the `gsheet` module within the `chat_gpt` package.  `GptGs` likely contains the logic for handling Google Sheets related tasks, specifically for tasks pertaining to ChatGPT.

**How to use it (Example):**

This module likely needs to be imported into another script to utilize its capabilities.  To use the `GptGs` class:


```python
# Example usage (assuming you have the necessary dependencies installed)
from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt import GptGs

# Initialize the GptGs class
gpt_gs = GptGs()

# Example of how you might use the class (replace with actual method calls)
# ... (e.g., to retrieve data from Google Sheets)
try:
    data = gpt_gs.get_data_from_sheet()
    # Further processing with the retrieved data from Google Sheets
    print(data)  # Output the data.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error accessing Google Sheet: {e}")

# ... (Example operations using the retrieved data or other functions within the GptGs class)
```

**Important considerations:**

* **Dependencies:** Make sure the necessary libraries (e.g., `google-api-python-client`) are installed.  You'll likely need to install these libraries using `pip`.
* **Authentication:**  The `GptGs` class (or related modules) will likely require authentication to access the Google Sheets.  Proper authentication mechanisms will be crucial.  Example credentials, scopes, and configuration are not shown in the given code snippet. You'll need to provide credentials to authorize interactions with Google Sheets.
* **Error handling:** The provided example includes basic error handling.  You should add more robust error handling in a production environment to gracefully manage potential failures in accessing Google Sheets.
* **Configuration:** The `MODE` variable hints at the possibility of additional configuration options.
* **Documentation:**  Look for the documentation within the `hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/gsheet.py` file for a detailed understanding of the `GptGs` class's methods, parameters, and usage.

This guide provides a basic framework.  Detailed implementation would need the contents of the `gsheet.py` file and any accompanying configuration files to provide specific instructions.
