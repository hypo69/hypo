```python
import pytest
import json
import jquery_3_5_1  # Replace with the actual module name

#  Note:  Testing this jQuery code directly is very difficult and likely not feasible.
#  The code is a JavaScript library and needs to be executed in a browser environment.
#  Testing jQuery-based functions would involve a Selenium or similar setup to simulate
#  browser actions and interactions.
#  The following example test cases are illustrative and demonstrate a general approach
#  but would not run directly against the provided JavaScript code.


def test_jquery_exists():
    """Verifies that the jQuery library is accessible."""
    assert jquery_3_5_1, "jQuery library not found"


# Example test (Illustrative only, not directly executable)
def test_jquery_select_element_by_id():
    """Checks if an element with a specific ID can be selected."""
    # (Illustrative - Replace with appropriate setup)
    #  Assuming you have a mock document with a div with id "myDiv"
    # mock_document = {"body": {"children": [{"id": "myDiv", "innerHTML": "Some text"}]}}
    #  ... implementation for selecting by id ...
    # result = jquery_3_5_1.select("#myDiv", mock_document)

    # result = jquery_3_5_1.select(".myClass", mock_document)
    # assert result[0]['innerHTML'] == "Class text"


def test_jquery_create_element():
    """Checks the creation of a new HTML element."""
    # (Illustrative - Replace with appropriate setup)
    # new_element = jquery_3_5_1.createElement("p")
    # assert new_element.tagName == "P"


def test_jquery_attr():
    """Tests the attr function, checking if an attribute can be set and retrieved."""
    # (Illustrative - Replace with appropriate setup)
    # mock_element = {"id": "myElement", "attributes": [{"name": "data-name", "value": "value1"}]}
    # jquery_3_5_1.attr(mock_element, "data-name", "value2")  # Setting the attribute
    # assert jquery_3_5_1.attr(mock_element, "data-name") == "value2" # Getting the attribute
    pass


# Example test for exception handling (Illustrative only)
def test_jquery_invalid_selector():
    """Checks the handling of an invalid selector."""
    #  (Illustrative -  Need a way to simulate failure in the jQuery code)
    # with pytest.raises(jquery_3_5_1.Error):
    #     jquery_3_5_1.select("#invalid_id", mock_document) # Mock failure/exception
    pass



# Note:  The example tests are highly simplified.  You need to
#        integrate mock document or DOM objects to represent the real-world
#        browser environment and to trigger interactions to test the specific
#        jQuery methods and functions.  This requires more setup like using Selenium.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **JavaScript Library Testing:**  Testing a JavaScript library like jQuery requires a different approach than testing Python code.  You can't directly run tests against the JavaScript code in this Python file.  You need to create test scenarios that simulate how jQuery would be used in a browser environment.  Tools like Selenium (a browser automation framework) are essential for this kind of testing.


2. **Illustrative Tests:** The example tests provided above are *illustrative* and won't execute against the original JavaScript code.  They show the structure you might follow using Selenium or similar frameworks to test selectors, element creation, attribute manipulation, and exception handling when testing jQuery functions.


3. **Mock Objects:** Replace the placeholder comments with code that creates mock objects (DOM elements, documents) representing the browser environment's objects and manipulate them to trigger jQuery functions.


4. **Error Handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to test that jQuery handles invalid selectors or inputs as expected.  You must have a way to simulate errors within the library code for the test cases to work.



5. **Test Driven Development:** The best practice would be to write tests *before* implementing the jQuery code in Python. This test-driven development approach ensures that your implementation correctly addresses the test cases.


6. **Selenium/Browser Automation:**  To test the jQuery functions as they would work in a browser, you need to incorporate a browser automation framework (like Selenium). Selenium allows you to load HTML documents into a browser and execute JavaScript code within that context.

**How to use these tests (Illustrative Example with Selenium):**

```python
# (Example using Selenium, not executable against the provided JavaScript)
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# ... other imports ...

def test_element_selection():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Replace with your webdriver
    driver.get("your_html_page.html") # Load the HTML with a jQuery element
    time.sleep(2)  # Important: wait for elements to load

    try:
        element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "myDiv") # Find an element
        assert element.text == "Some text", "Element text not as expected"
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Element not found: {e}")
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `"your_html_page.html"` and `"myDiv"` with your actual values. This example demonstrates the Selenium setup needed to integrate browser interaction with your tests. This example (and all of the illustrative examples above) needs appropriate imports and configuration to work.
