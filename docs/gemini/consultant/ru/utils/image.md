.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.
- Replaced `MODE = 'dev'` with an empty string.
- Improved error handling. Using `logger.error` and `logger.critical` for better error management.  Added specific error handling for HTTP errors.
- Corrected the file creation/verification logic.  Added `file_path.unlink()` to delete empty files that fail to be properly saved, which resolves the issue where the previous approach could leave empty files that were not verified.
- Added `raise_for_status()` in `save_png_from_url` to handle HTTP errors from aiohttp.
- Added more comprehensive docstrings in RST format, using `:raises` to document potential exceptions.
- Replaced `pprint` with `logger`.  This is important for debugging in a production environment.
- Improved code readability by restructuring some sections of the code.
