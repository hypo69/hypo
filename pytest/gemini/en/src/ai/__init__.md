```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.ai import GoogleGenerativeAI, OpenAIModel

# Tests for the AI Model modules (gemini and openai)


def test_google_generative_ai_exists():
    """Checks if the GoogleGenerativeAI class exists."""
    assert GoogleGenerativeAI is not None, "GoogleGenerativeAI class not found"


def test_openai_model_exists():
    """Checks if the OpenAIModel class exists."""
    assert OpenAIModel is not None, "OpenAIModel class not found"

# Add more tests as needed.  Since the provided code only imports classes
# and sets a constant, there's not much to test at this level.

# Example of a test that assumes a method `generate_text` exists:
# (This needs to be replaced with actual test logic if such a method is in the code)
# def test_google_generate_text_valid_input(example_google_data):
#     """Tests the GoogleGenerativeAI.generate_text method with valid input."""
#     result = google_ai_instance.generate_text(example_google_data['prompt'])
#     assert result is not None, "Generate text returned None."
#     # Add more specific assertions, depending on the expected output type
#     # e.g., assert isinstance(result, str)


# Example of a test using pytest.raises for exception handling
# (This also needs to be adapted based on the actual methods and their expected exceptions)
# def test_google_generate_text_invalid_prompt(example_google_data):
#    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#        google_ai_instance.generate_text(example_google_data['invalid_prompt'])
#    assert "Invalid prompt" in str(excinfo.value)


# Example fixture (replace with your actual fixture if needed):
@pytest.fixture
def example_google_data():
    """Provides example data for the GoogleGenerativeAI tests."""
    return {
        'prompt': 'Generate a short story.',
        'invalid_prompt': '',  # Or an invalid prompt format
    }


@pytest.fixture
def example_openai_data():
    """Provides example data for the OpenAIModel tests."""
    return {'parameters': {'max_tokens': 10}}

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Targeted Tests:** The previous response lacked specific tests. Now, we test for the existence of the classes themselves, which is a fundamental check.

2. **Placeholder Tests:**  I've added placeholder tests (`test_google_generate_text_valid_input`, etc.) that show the structure needed for testing methods (like `generate_text`).  These placeholders demonstrate how to interact with the objects and add assertions for validation. **Crucially, these are *placeholders* and MUST be updated with the actual methods in your code.**

3. **Example Fixture:** The `example_google_data` fixture is created to hold the example data for tests.  This is excellent practice to make test data reusable and easier to manage.  You need to add similar fixtures for any other classes or methods you need to test.

4. **Error Handling (pytest.raises):**  The placeholder `test_google_generate_text_invalid_prompt` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to verify that the code correctly handles exceptions.  Modify this test according to *your* specific error handling and exception types.

5. **Clear Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each test function, which improves readability and maintainability.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder `google_ai_instance` with the appropriate instantiation of your `GoogleGenerativeAI` class.
2. **Add Method Tests:** Add more test cases for all relevant methods in your code, following the structure shown.  This is crucial for thorough testing.
3. **Modify Data:** Tailor the fixture data to reflect your application's expected inputs and the type of exceptions your code is meant to handle.
4. **Run Tests:** Execute the tests with `pytest`.


This improved response provides a solid foundation for testing your `ai` module.  Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual code and data relevant to your module's functions. Remember that your test code must now use the fixture for test data.
