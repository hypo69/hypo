### **endpoints Module**: Final Consumer Endpoints

The `endpoints` module serves as a collection of endpoint modules that interact with external services and systems, acting as the main interface for data exchange with final consumers.  It includes the following submodules:

1. **prestashop**
   Provides integration with the PrestaShop e-commerce platform.  This includes functions for product and order management, enabling seamless data exchange between the application and the PrestaShop system.

2. **bots**
   Manages bot integrations, supporting platforms like Telegram and Discord.  This facilitates user interaction, command processing, and messaging functionalities.

3. **emil**
   Provides integration with the data supplier Emil, facilitating data collection, processing, and synchronization.  Clarify the *specific* data types and formats exchanged.

4. **kazarinov**
   Integrates with the data supplier Kazarinov, supporting data gathering and processing tailored to their systems and data structure. Specify the *nature* of the data from Kazarinov and how it's processed.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# Example usage (replace with actual module imports and methods)
from endpoints.prestashop import getProductList

products = getProductList(shop_id=123)
print(products)


# Example for bots
from endpoints.bots import send_message_to_telegram

send_message_to_telegram(user_id=456, message="Order confirmed!")
```

**Further Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Detail how errors are handled and logged within each submodule.  What exceptions are caught and how are failures communicated?
* **Data Validation:** Describe data validation procedures used to ensure data integrity and correctness.
* **Authentication:** If authentication is required for interacting with external services, detail the methods used.
* **Rate Limiting:** Describe how rate limiting is managed for external services to avoid exceeding API quotas.
* **Dependencies:** Explicitly list any external libraries or dependencies required for each submodule.  This will help maintainability.
* **Data Structure:** Briefly describe the data structures used for exchanging data with each external service.

**Future Enhancements:**

* [Add potential future enhancements here, e.g., support for new platforms, improved error handling, etc.]
