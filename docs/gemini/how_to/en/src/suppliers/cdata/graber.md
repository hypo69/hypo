.. module: src.suppliers.cdata
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis:  Class to collect product field values from `cdata.co.il`.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    If non-standard processing is needed, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, preliminary actions can be performed using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, you need to pass a value
    to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines
    and redefine its behavior.

```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is error handling within the `fetch_all_data` function.  The `try...except` block catches potential exceptions during the fetching process.  Crucially, it logs the error using `logger.error` (or `logger.exception` if you want a traceback). This is vital for debugging and identifying problems.  I've added a `ProductFields` error return as an example of how you might handle errors in production.
* **`self.d` Assignment:** The `self.d = driver` line is moved into the `grab_page` method for proper assignment.
* **Data Fetching Functions:** The `fetch_all_data` function now collects all calls to the data fetching methods, so you won't have to repeat the `kwargs.get(...)` code for each.
* **Robustness:** The `try...except` block provides essential error handling, preventing the whole `grab_page` function from crashing if one data fetching step fails.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is restructured to be more readable and maintainable.
* **Function `fetch_all_data`:** This function acts as a central hub for fetching all data. It is called once to gather all the product data.
* **Logging:** The code now includes proper logging with error messages to the console, for easier debugging.
* **Example Error Return:** The `grab_page` method now returns a `ProductFields` object with an error field to signal failure. Modify this as needed for your error handling scheme.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Import the Graber class:** `from hypotez.src.suppliers.cdata.graber import Graber`
2.  **Instantiate the class:** `graber = Graber(driver)`
3.  **Call `grab_page`:** `product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='123')`

Now, your code will be much more robust and manageable when dealing with potential errors during product data extraction.  Remember to tailor the error handling and the example `ProductFields` return to match your specific application needs. Remember to replace the placeholder comment `# ... (Add other field fetching functions here) ...` with your actual field-fetching methods.
