How to use the AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest class

This class, `AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest`, is part of the AliExpress API and allows you to query product information for affiliate marketing purposes.  It's designed to be used within a larger Python application interacting with the AliExpress API.

**Key Concepts**

* **RestApi:** This class is a base class; `AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest` inherits from it. This implies a common structure and functionality for interacting with the AliExpress API.  You'll likely need to understand the base class `RestApi` to use this class effectively.
* **Parameters:** The class defines numerous parameters (e.g., `category_ids`, `keywords`, `min_sale_price`) that you must provide to filter and refine your product search.
* **Pagination:** `page_no` and `page_size` allow you to paginate through the results, handling large result sets.

**Usage Example**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest import AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest

# Create an instance of the request object, specifying the API endpoint (optional):
query = AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest(domain="api-sg.aliexpress.com", port=80)

# Set the necessary parameters for your query.  These are crucial!
query.keywords = "women's shoes"
query.min_sale_price = 10
query.max_sale_price = 50
query.page_size = 20  # Sets the number of results per page.
query.page_no = 1   # Get the first page.

#  Crucially, you'll need to obtain an API key and set the app_signature:
query.app_signature = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual key!

# Send the request and process the response.  How to do this depends on how
# the RestApi class handles the actual API call.
try:
    response = query.getResponse()
    # Process the 'response' object to get the product data.
    # The structure of this object depends on the API's response format.
    # Look into the documentation of the RestApi class for how to access this data.
    print(response) # Example output â€“ typically this will be JSON.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations**

1. **`app_signature`:**  This is a critical parameter.  You *must* replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key from AliExpress.  Failing to do so will likely result in an authentication error.

2. **`getResponse()`:**  The example shows calling `query.getResponse()`.  This is a placeholder.  The `RestApi` class will contain the actual logic for sending the HTTP request to the API.  Pay close attention to the response format specified in the AliExpress documentation, as it may need parsing (e.g., using `json.loads()` if the response is JSON).

3. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is essential.  The AliExpress API might return errors (e.g., invalid parameters, network issues).  Robust code needs to handle these potential errors.

4. **Documentation:** The `AliexpressAffiliateProductQueryRequest` itself doesn't detail how to use it, and you will need the documentation of the `RestApi` class to understand what the response object and `getResponse()` will return. The general AliExpress API docs and the documentation for the surrounding Python project should have the necessary details to proceed.


This guide provides a basic structure; you'll need to adapt it based on the specific data requirements of your application, including handling pagination and error cases.  Consult the full documentation of the `RestApi` class and the AliExpress API documentation for complete details.
