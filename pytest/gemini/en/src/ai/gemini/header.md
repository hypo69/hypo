**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs`:** The `@patch` decorator is used to mock the `gs` module, specifically the `gs.path.root` attribute. This prevents the test from interacting with the actual file system, making it more robust and avoiding issues with file dependencies.
* **Creating Dummy Files:** Dummy files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`, `config.json`, etc.) are created for testing, allowing us to simulate various scenarios.
* **Error Handling:** Includes test cases for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, which are the likely exceptions when the configuration file is missing or malformed.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  More descriptive names improve readability.
* **`teardown_module`:**  A crucial addition to remove the dummy files after the tests, preventing unexpected side effects and maintaining a clean testing environment.
* **pytest.raises:** Added basic exception handling using `pytest.raises` (though, due to the mocking in the config tests, `assert config is None` should be sufficient).
* **`PROJECT_ROOT`:** Introduced a constant for the project root, enhancing the test's portability.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Install `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  Run the tests:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This revised solution is more complete, robust, and addresses potential issues while also maintaining good test practices. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src"` with your actual project's source directory if it's different. Remember to add appropriate imports and ensure that the mocked `gs` module is properly set up within your testing environment.
