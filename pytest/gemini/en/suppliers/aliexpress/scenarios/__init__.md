**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code (`__init__.py`) doesn't contain functions or classes that can be directly tested in the typical sense.  It only defines a constant (`MODE`) and imports a submodule (`login`).  The above tests address those characteristics.

* **`test_mode_is_development`**: This test verifies that the `MODE` constant is correctly set. It checks if the value is 'development' and raises an assertion error if it's different.  This is the most straightforward test possible for this particular module.


* **`test_login_module_exists`**: This test is crucial for ensuring the import works correctly.  If there's a problem importing the `login` module, this test will fail.

**Why This is Important and How to Extend:**

Testing `__init__.py` files (and configuration files) is often crucial.  It makes sure that critical setup elements are in place and that other modules are available.

**How to Use These Tests with pytest:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_scenarios.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run pytest from your terminal in the directory containing the file: `pytest test_aliexpress_scenarios.py`

**Important Note:**

In a real application, you'll typically have a separate file (e.g., `test_login.py`) to test the functionality of the `login` module.  These tests will include assertions about the login process (like verifying return values, user authentication, and handling of invalid inputs). The current tests are illustrative of what you might do to check the integrity of the `__init__.py` file.
