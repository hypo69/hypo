```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Data:**  The code now includes `test_file_content`, `test_csv_data`, and `test_json_data` fixtures to provide data for testing. This isolates the test functions from needing to create files each time, keeping them cleaner and more efficient.

2. **`tmpdir` Fixture:** Uses `pytest.tmpdir` fixture to create temporary files within the test directory. This avoids cluttering the project's file system and ensures each test runs independently.

3. **Clearer Error Handling:**  Uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing, with a `match` argument to make the assertions more informative.  This is crucial for robust test cases.

4. **File Existence Checks:** Verifies that the files exist after `save_text_file` and `csv2dict` or using assertions to check if the functions created the expected output files (like XLSX).

5. **`csv2dict` Test:** Now creates a temporary CSV file to test with actual valid data.

6. **`json2xls` Test:** The `json2xls` test now has a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions during file processing and provides a very basic way to test the function without detailed verification of the generated XLSX.  Important to install the correct library, for example, `openpyxl`


**Before running these tests:**

* **Install necessary libraries:**  You'll need libraries like `openpyxl` (for XLSX handling) and potentially others depending on the functions you test. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl pytest
   ```

* **Replace placeholders:** Adapt the test data and file paths to the specific functions and data formats of your `utils` module.

* **Add more tests:** Extend these tests to cover all functions and methods in your `utils` module.


This improved solution addresses potential issues in the previous example, making the tests more reliable and comprehensive. Remember to adapt the fixtures and tests to your actual code's functionality and requirements. Remember to replace placeholders like the exact path to the utils module. Also, add more test cases for other functions in your module.
