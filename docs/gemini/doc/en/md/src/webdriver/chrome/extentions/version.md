## Notes

The presence of multiple `"""docstrings"""` suggests various levels of documentation or metadata within the module.  The structure and content of the docstrings, especially those related to the `MODE` variable, `__version__`, and other variables, are crucial for understanding the intended usage and purpose of the extension within the wider `hypotez` project.  Further details within the project's codebase (and potentially associated documentation) would provide a more complete picture of how these variables are used and their meaning.
