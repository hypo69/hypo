```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** The code now utilizes `pytest.fixture` for `settings_file` and `readme_file` to create temporary test files, allowing for consistent and isolated tests without polluting the project's actual files. `mock_sys_path` clears `sys.path` before each test run to prevent interaction between tests.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).

* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests now cover valid input, cases where the marker files aren't found, and cases where `settings.json` is not found or is invalid JSON.

* **Error Handling:** The tests verify the correct handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.

* **Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` test demonstrates how to handle the case where no marker files are found.


* **Import Fixes:** The code now properly imports all necessary modules (`json`, `Path`, `sys`).
* **`tmp_path` fixture**: Uses `tmp_path` fixture from pytest to create temporary directory for testing

* **Complete test_settings_loading_no_settings_file:** The new test checks the correct behavior when the `settings.json` file is missing, confirming the function correctly uses default values for attributes


This improved test suite is more comprehensive, robust, and adheres to best practices for writing `pytest` tests. Remember to install the necessary packages (e.g., `pytest`, `packaging` if not already present). Then, run `pytest` in your terminal from the project's root directory to execute these tests. Remember to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
