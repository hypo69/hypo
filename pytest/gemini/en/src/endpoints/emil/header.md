**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Temporary Directories:** The `tmp_project_dir` fixture now creates a temporary directory structure containing `pyproject.toml` for reliable testing. This prevents interference between tests and ensures a clean environment for each.
2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests for cases where no marker files are found and when the current directory is already the project root.
4. **`pytest.raises` not needed:** The original code was handling potential errors with `try...except` blocks, which makes error handling implicit. The `pytest.raises` approach was removed because error handling is already tested.
5. **Robustness:** The tests now handle cases where the target file or directory is not found or doesn't exist.
6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover valid input scenarios, scenarios where marker files are not present, and cases with nested directories.
7. **Explicit Assertions:** The tests use explicit assertions `assert root_dir == tmp_project_dir` to confirm the expected results.
8. **Clean-up:** The tests now clean up the temporary directories after each test run. This is crucial for preventing test flakiness and conflicts. 

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the test code (above) as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved solution addresses the shortcomings of the original and provides a more robust and reliable test suite. Remember to adapt the test code to the actual structure and logic of your project if you need to test `gs` and the `settings.json` related code.
