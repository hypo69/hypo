```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, there are no test cases to write.  The HTML file
# is a web page, not Python code.

# If there were Python code, example tests could look like this:

# Example, assuming a file named 'popup.py':
# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# import logging
#
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
#
# def get_page_title():
#     """Gets the title of the current webpage."""
#     # Simulate getting the title from a browser context
#     return "Example Page Title"
#
# def log_page_title(title):
#     """Logs the page title."""
#     logger.info(f"Page title: {title}")
#     return title
#
#
# # Example tests using pytest
# import pytest
#
# def test_get_page_title_valid():
#     """Tests getting the page title with valid input."""
#     title = get_page_title()
#     assert title == "Example Page Title"
#
# def test_log_page_title_valid(caplog):
#     """Tests logging the page title."""
#     title = "Test Title"
#     log_page_title(title)
#     assert "Page title: Test Title" in caplog.text
#
# def test_log_page_title_empty(caplog):
#     """Tests logging an empty page title."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):  # or ValueError depending on expected behavior
#         log_page_title(None)  # Or an empty string, depending on the function
#
# # Example fixture (if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def test_title():
#     return "Example Title"
#
# def test_get_page_title_invalid_input(caplog):
#     #This would fail in a real application, so an exception would be expected.
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
#         get_page_title(123) # or some other bad input
#     assert "Invalid input" in str(excinfo.value)

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is a web page, not Python code.  Therefore, no Python code needs testing.  This answer demonstrates the structure of pytest tests, but, of course, **you cannot apply them to the example HTML**.

**Example `popup.py` (if a Python script existed):**

The example `popup.py` demonstrates how to write tests if you have actual Python code in `popup.html` (or a separate Python file). It includes:

*   **Valid Input Tests:** Verifying correct function behavior with expected input.
*   **Invalid Input Tests (with `pytest.raises`):**  Testing how the code handles bad input by using `pytest.raises`. This shows you how to anticipate and catch exceptions raised by the code under test.
*   **Edge Case Tests:** The example shows a possible edge case where the input might be invalid.  Adapt as needed for the specific logic.
*   **Fixtures:**  Illustrates how fixtures can be used to create reusable data for your tests.
*   **Logging:** Included the use of Python's `logging` module, which is generally good practice.  Example tests show how to use `caplog` for checking logging output.

**Crucially, replace the example `popup.py` content with the actual Python code from your project if you have one.**  Then use the example test cases as a template for your own tests. Remember to adapt the specific test scenarios based on the functionality of your code.  You might need to import other modules, handle different input types, and so on.
