# Module: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py`, likely contains initialization code for endpoints related to PrestaShop domains.  It appears to define a global variable `MODE` and contain several docstrings describing the module's purpose, though these docstrings are incomplete and could be improved with more specific explanations.  Its purpose isn't clearly defined from the provided code.


## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A global variable defining the operating mode, likely 'dev' in this case.

**Value**: `'dev'`

## Missing Information

The code lacks the necessary docstrings for functions and classes to properly document the module's functionality. To improve documentation, the code should include complete docstrings for any functions, classes, or methods it contains, following the format specified in the instruction.  The docstrings for the module, class, and variables provided currently are incomplete and unhelpful.
