# No Python code to test in the provided HTML.  Therefore, no tests are possible.
#  To create tests, you need to provide the JavaScript (popup.js) file
#  that handles the AngularJS logic for the HTML.  
#  The tests will need to interact with this JavaScript to validate 
#  the UI interactions and data flow.


# Example of how tests would look if popup.js was available:
# (This is placeholder code, replace with actual test cases)

# Assuming a popup.js file with functions like sendMessage() and trainModel()


# Example fixture (replace with actual data if needed)

            "trainingStatus": "Training initiated"}

**Explanation and Crucial Missing Information:**

The provided HTML (`popup.html`) is a *presentation layer* using AngularJS and JavaScript.  To write tests, you need the corresponding JavaScript (`popup.js`) file containing the AngularJS controller and the logic that handles user interactions (like sending messages, training the model, etc.).  That JavaScript is *completely* missing.

**How to proceed:**

1. **Provide the `popup.js` file:**  This is absolutely essential.

2. **Identify the functions to test:** Look for functions in `popup.js` that correspond to the user interactions.  Examples: `sendMessage()`, `trainModel()`, `setActiveTab()`.

3. **Use mocking libraries:** Mocks are necessary to simulate external interactions or services that these functions might use (e.g., API calls).  A popular library for this in Python is `unittest.mock` or the `pytest-mock` plugin.

4. **Use assertions:** Assert that the JavaScript code modifies the HTML (e.g., changes in the `response` div, updates to `trainingStatus`) as expected.


Once you provide `popup.js`, I can give you much more specific and useful test cases. The placeholder tests above show the general structure and how to use `pytest` with mocking. Remember to install `pytest` (`pip install pytest`) if you haven't already.
