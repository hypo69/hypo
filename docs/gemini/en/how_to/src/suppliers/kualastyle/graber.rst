How to use the Graber class for extracting product data from kualastyle.co.il
==============================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `Graber` (inherited from `Grbr`) for extracting product data from the `kualastyle.co.il` website.  The `Graber` class handles the specific data extraction logic for this supplier, offering pre-defined and customizable functions for various product attributes. It uses a `Context` object (though currently defined as a placeholder) to manage potentially necessary global settings. The class leverages an asynchronous approach using `asyncio` for efficient data retrieval.  Crucially, it provides optional pre-processing steps (currently a placeholder), that can be executed before fetching product information using a decorator.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**  Instantiate the `Graber` class, passing the `Driver` object to the constructor.  This establishes the connection to the web browser.  `Graber` sets its `supplier_prefix` and inherits the base class `Grbr`'s methods. It also sets a global variable `Context.locator_for_decorator` to `None`. This value is a key indicator in the decorator.

2. **Data Extraction:** The `grab_page` method is called asynchronously.  It calls an internal helper function (`fetch_all_data`).

3. **Data Fetching:**  Within `fetch_all_data`, numerous functions, corresponding to different product attributes (e.g., `id_product`, `name`, `description`), are called asynchronously. Each attribute-specific function (`id_product()`, `name()`, etc.) is responsible for extracting and formatting the relevant data from the website.

4. **Data Aggregation:** The functions extract data and populate the `self.fields` object, representing the extracted product information.

5. **Data Return:** The method returns the populated `ProductFields` object containing all the extracted product details.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.kualastyle.graber import Graber

    # Assuming you have a Driver object (driver) and ID for the product
    async def example_usage():
        driver = Driver()  # Replace with your actual driver initialization
        try:
           # Initialization: Instantiate the Graber class with the driver
           graber = Graber(driver)
           # Get product data, passing product ID
           product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product="123")
           # Print the extracted product name (or other attributes)
           print(product_data.name)
        except Exception as e:
           print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        finally:
           await driver.quit()

    asyncio.run(example_usage())
