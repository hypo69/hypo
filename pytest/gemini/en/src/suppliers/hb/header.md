**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_file`).

2. **Using `pytest.raises` (not needed here):** The original code doesn't have exceptions that needed to be handled using `pytest.raises`.  I've commented on potential points where `pytest.raises` could have been used.

3. **Temporary Directory Creation:**  Crucially, the tests now create temporary directories to isolate each test run. This prevents conflicts between tests and ensures that each test starts from a clean state. The `teardown_module` function removes these temporary directories after all tests have run, preventing file system clutter.

4. **Explicit Path Handling:** The tests now use `Path` objects for working with file paths, making the code more robust and platform-independent.

5. **Mock `__file__`:** I've used `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `__file__` attribute of the current module. This is essential as `__file__` is used within the function, and we need to control its value for testing purposes.


6. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios including files existing at different levels in the directory hierarchy, and the case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`.


7. **Error Handling (Improved):** The original code had error handling for file not found.   While pytest already handles most expected errors gracefully, I added a robust test covering cases where expected files are missing to ensure the `set_project_root` function doesn't cause issues in such cases.



This revised solution provides a more thorough and reliable set of tests for `set_project_root`. Remember to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
