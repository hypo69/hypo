```python
import pytest

# No Python code is present in the provided HTML file, so no tests can be written.
#  Tests would need to be written for any Python functions or classes used by the HTML.
#  For example, if the HTML interacted with a Python script for user input or data processing.

# Example tests (assuming a hypothetical Python script interacting with the HTML):

# def test_html_display(hypothetical_script_function):
#     """Tests if the HTML file is correctly displayed."""
#     # Replace with actual assertion based on the expected outcome of the HTML display
#     # For example, checking if a specific element is found or if the content is present
#     assert hypothetical_script_function()  # Assuming a function returns True if displayed correctly


# Example hypothetical Python code (and tests) to illuStarte:

# hypothetical_script.py
# import webbrowser

# def display_html_page():
#     webbrowser.open("hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/extentions/test_extention/html/popup.html")
#     return True # Return True if the page opens successfully

# test_hypothetical_script.py
# import pytest
# import webbrowser
# import time
# import os

# @pytest.fixture
# def display_page_function():
#     return display_html_page


# def test_html_display(display_page_function):
#     """Tests if the HTML file is correctly displayed."""
#     try:
#         display_page_function()
#         assert True, "HTML page displayed successfully."
#     except Exception as e:
#         assert False, f"Error displaying HTML page: {e}"

#     # Add assertions to check specific elements if needed.
#     # Example:
#     # time.sleep(5) # Wait for the page to load
#     # page = webbrowser.get().open("about:blank") # Assuming an actual interaction with a web page
#     # assert "Hypotez" in page.page_source, "Title 'Hypotez' not found"
#     # page.close()



# IMPORTANT:  Replace the example with the actual code/functions/classes if any.
# If there's no interaction between Python code and this HTML file, there are no tests to write
# for it in isolation.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

* **No Python Code Provided:** The provided code is HTML.  Testing HTML requires testing the *code* that interacts with it (e.g., Python code that displays, processes user input from the HTML page, etc.).  There's no Python code in the input; therefore, no tests can be written *directly* for the HTML file alone.


* **Example Hypothetical Scenario and Tests:** The example code adds a `display_html_page` function (hypothetical) and shows how you would write a test to ensure that function works.  This is *critical*: you need the Python code that interacts with the HTML to write useful and meaningful tests.

* **Error Handling and Assertions:** The example demonStartes how to use `try...except` for error handling if there's a problem when opening the HTML. This is much better than relying solely on implicit assertions.


* **Real-World Testing:** If there was an actual Python script interacting with the HTML page, tests would focus on verifying the expected behavior. For instance, you'd check whether user input is processed correctly, data is sent/received properly, and so on.


* **File Paths:** The provided `File location`  should be used appropriately when testing the files.


* **Import `webbrowser` (if used):**  Ensure to `import webbrowser` if your code uses it.


Remember to replace the example with your actual Python code and test accordingly.  A significant part of test-driven development is designing the *interactions* properly before writing tests.  Without Python code, testing the HTML itself is not possible.
