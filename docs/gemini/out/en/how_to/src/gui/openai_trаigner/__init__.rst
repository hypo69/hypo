How to use the hypotez/src/gui/openai_trаigner/__init__.py module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python module, located in the `hypotez/src/gui/openai_trаigner` directory, initializes variables and imports classes for the GUI application.  It sets a global variable `MODE` to 'dev' and imports necessary classes.  Specifically, it imports the `Version` class from `packaging.version` and the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` variables along with the `AssistantMainWindow` class, both presumably related to the OpenAI Trainer's GUI component.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Sets the `MODE` variable:** This module initializes a global variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value `'dev'` to it.  This variable likely controls settings or behavior within the application, with 'dev' suggesting a development or testing mode.

2. **Imports necessary modules and classes:** The module imports essential elements for the application's operation.
   - It imports the `Version` class from the `packaging.version` library, which is likely used for managing version information.
   - It imports `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from the `.version` module, presumably containing metadata (version string, documentation, and more detailed information) about the application's version and functionality.
   - It imports `AssistantMainWindow` from the `.main_window` module, which is the core class responsible for the application's main window.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (Example demonStarting how to access the AssistantMainWindow)

    # Import the AssistantMainWindow from the module
    from hypotez.src.gui.openai_trаigner import AssistantMainWindow

    # Create an instance of the AssistantMainWindow
    main_window = AssistantMainWindow()

    # Use the main_window object
    # (e.g., to show the window, or access its methods)
    # Example:
    main_window.show()
