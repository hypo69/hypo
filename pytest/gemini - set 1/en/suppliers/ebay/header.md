**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for creating test files:** The `mock_settings_file` fixture now creates a `settings.json` file in a temporary directory, making tests more robust and avoiding issues with file system conflicts.  Similar fixtures are added for `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the input conditions being tested.
* **Using `tmp_path`:** Crucially, the `tmp_path` fixture from pytest is used to create temporary directories. This isolates tests and prevents interference between runs.
* **`sys.path.clear()`:** Added `sys.path.clear()` to each test function to ensure that the `sys.path` is clean for each test, preventing unexpected interactions between tests.
* **Handling Missing Files:** The original code's `try...except` blocks are now incorporated into the tests to handle the cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might not exist, avoiding potential crashes.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Tests now cover scenarios where the marker file is in the current directory, a parent directory, and a deeper ancestor.


This improved solution creates a more robust and reliable test suite for the `get_project_root` function.  Important: Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`) if you haven't already. `pip install pytest packaging`.  To run the tests, save the test code and the original Python code in the same directory. Then execute `pytest` in your terminal.
