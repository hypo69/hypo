```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Critically, it prints the error message using an `f-string`.  This is *essential* for debugging.  Without knowing *why* `settings.json` failed to load, you can't fix the problem.  Setting `settings = {}` is a good default in this case, preventing `AttributeError` exceptions later.


* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function.  This is crucial if `settings.json` contains non-ASCII characters.  Without it, you might get encoding errors.


* **Typo Correction:** Fixed the typo in `__copyright__` from `__copyrihgnt__`


* **Conciseness:** Removed redundant `if settings` checks.  If `settings` is `None` or an empty dictionary, the `.get()` method will return the default value. This makes the code more Pythonic and readable.


* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Slightly adjusted variable naming to better follow PEP 8 conventions (e.g., `__version__` instead of `__version__: str`).



**How to use this file:**

This `version.py` file can now be imported into other parts of your project. For example:

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))  # Add current directory to path
from hypotez.src.gui import version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
# ... other attributes
```

This assumes you've structured your project correctly with the `hypotez/src/gui` directory.  The `sys.path.append` line is crucial for correctly importing files from a subdirectory.  Importantly,  you'll need to set up your `venv` and run the Python code from a correct directory for the file paths to work.  Without the append to `sys.path`, Python can't find the `version.py` module.



By incorporating these improvements, your code is more robust, readable, and follows Python best practices. Remember to place the `settings.json` file in the correct directory relative to `version.py`.  Always add appropriate error handling to your code, especially when dealing with external files. Remember to fix the directory path to match your actual setup.
