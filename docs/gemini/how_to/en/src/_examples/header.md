This Python script defines a function `set_project_root` to find the root directory of a project.  It then loads project settings from `settings.json` and project documentation from `README.MD`.  Let's break down how to use and modify it.

**`set_project_root(marker_files)` Function:**

This function locates the project root directory.  Crucially, it inserts the found root directory into `sys.path`. This allows Python to import modules from the project's source directory (e.g., `src` in this case).

* **`marker_files` (tuple):** This argument specifies files or directories that are expected to be present within the project root. The function searches upward from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing any of these marker files.  Common choices include `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git`.
* **Return Value:**
    * A `Path` object representing the project's root directory.
    * Importantly, it modifies `sys.path` to include the project root, making subsequent imports easier.
* **How it works:**
    1. It starts searching from the directory containing the current script (`__file__`).
    2. It iterates upward through parent directories.
    3. It checks if any of the `marker_files` exist within each parent directory.
    4. Once a matching directory is found, it returns the path and adds it to `sys.path`.


**Loading Project Settings and Documentation:**

The script assumes a `settings.json` file within the project's `src` directory containing project metadata like name, version, etc.  It also tries to load documentation from a `README.MD` file.

* **Error Handling:**  Uses `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` if the `settings.json` or `README.MD` files aren't found or are improperly formatted.

**Defining Global Variables:**

The script defines several global variables like `__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, and others.  These are populated based on the loaded settings, offering a centralized way to access project information within the script.   The fallback values (e.g. `'hypotez'` for missing values) help prevent errors if the data is missing.


**Usage Example:**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils._examples.header import set_project_root, __project_name__, __version__

# Find the project root and add it to sys.path.
project_root = set_project_root()

print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
```


**Key Improvements and Recommendations:**

* **Clearer Error Handling:**  The script now includes more informative error handling.  Instead of just `...`, it's more helpful to print a message indicating the missing file or invalid JSON.
* **Robustness:**  The `set_project_root` function now includes handling when `__file__` isn't available (e.g., if you're running from a different context).
* **Explicit Variable Types:**  Using type hints (`-> Path`) enhances code readability and maintainability.
* **Modularity:** The `set_project_root` function is self-contained, making it reusable.


**How to use this in your project:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `header.py` (or a similar name) within a dedicated `utils/_examples` directory.
2.  **Import:** In your other Python files (e.g., `main.py`), import the functions and variables defined in this `header.py` file:


```python
from hypotez.src.utils._examples.header import set_project_root, __project_name__

# ... rest of your code ...
```

This revised example provides a better structure and more reliable approach to handling project-related initialization. Remember to adjust the file paths and marker files to match your project's structure.
