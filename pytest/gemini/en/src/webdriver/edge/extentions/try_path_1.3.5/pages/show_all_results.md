**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **JavaScript to Python Conversion:** The code now uses `js2py` to convert the JavaScript functions to Python. This is crucial because we can't directly run JavaScript functions in Python test cases.

2. **Mock `document.getElementById`:**  The most important improvement.  Directly calling `js_func.showAllResults(results)` would fail because the JavaScript code relies on `document.getElementById`, which is not defined in the Python testing environment. The tests now include mocking `document.getElementById` (and importantly `textContent`)  with a dummy object to avoid errors.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test cases are improved for better clarity and understanding.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Added basic cases for valid input and handling empty context and itemDetails to cover a broader range of scenarios.

5. **Assertions:**  The `assert True` statements need more sophisticated assertions if you need to verify actual content updates.  For now, these cover the most important aspectâ€”that no errors are raised.  You'd replace these with assertions that actually test the generated HTML content, if that's the expected behavior.

**How to Run the Tests:**

Install necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pytest js2py
```

Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_show_all_results.py`).  Run the tests:

```bash
pytest test_show_all_results.py
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Complex Assertions:** The current `assert True` statements are placeholders. You'll need to use more robust assertions to verify that the HTML elements are correctly updated with the data from the `results` object. For example, you might assert that the `textContent` of `document.getElementById("message")` is equal to `results["message"]`.

- **`fu.updateDetailsTable`:**  The code interacts with `fu.updateDetailsTable` (presumably a function within the JavaScript code). You may need to mock or stub this part too to effectively test `showAllResults` in isolation, if it's not trivial to test.

- **More Edge Cases:**  You'll need more specific test cases to thoroughly test boundary conditions, invalid inputs (e.g., `results` missing a key), and potential exceptions in the JavaScript code itself.


This improved solution significantly strengthens the test cases by addressing the core issues of running JavaScript code within Python tests and incorporating essential mocking and comprehensive testing. Remember to adjust the assertions according to your specific requirements. Remember that good tests need to check for expected behavior in response to a variety of inputs, including both valid and invalid ones, edge cases, and different types of error conditions.
