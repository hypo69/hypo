**Documentation (suitable for inclusion in a larger project's documentation):**

**File:** `hypotez/src/ai/myai/version.py`

**Description:** This file defines version information and licensing details for the `myai` module within the `hypotez` project.

**Contents:**

* **`__version__`:**  Specifies the current version of the `myai` module as 'v1.1'.
* **`__doc__`:**  (Empty)  This could contain a brief description of the module's purpose.
* **`__details__`:** (Empty)  Reserved for more detailed module documentation (e.g., dependencies, usage examples, etc.).
* **`__author__`:**  Indicates the author as 'hypo69'.
* **`__copyright__`:**  Contains the copyright notice and licensing information.  Crucially, it specifies the MIT License and prohibits commercial use without permission.  This is a critical part of open-source project management.
* **`__cofee__`:**  Includes a link to a donation platform for supporting the developer.  While good practice, this is generally kept separate from the core licensing.

**How to Use:**

This file is typically imported and used within other Python scripts within the `hypotez` project to retrieve the version information.  Examples:

```python
import hypotez.src.ai.myai.version as myai_version

print(myai_version.__version__)
print(myai_version.__copyright__)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Versioning:**  Use a consistent and well-defined versioning scheme (e.g., semantic versioning) to track changes and dependencies.
* **Licensing:**  Thoroughly review and understand the implications of your chosen license.
* **Documentation:**  Expand the `__doc__` and `__details__` variables to provide comprehensive documentation within the file itself.  Consider using docstrings (triple quotes) to improve documentation.

**Recommendation:**

The current `__doc__` and `__details__` variables are empty.  It's highly recommended to fill these in for clarity and helpfulness in future development. This includes, perhaps, usage examples or a simple overview of the intended functionality of the `myai` module.  Documenting dependencies, usage instructions, or any external resources required is important too.
