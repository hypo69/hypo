""" Project settings: passwords, server addresses, and other sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in a database in KeyPass format with a `.kdbx` extension.
To open the database, a master password is required.

Default Program Settings
The `ProjectSetting` class (`src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`) defines key configuration parameters:
- A list of suppliers that will be executed if no other is specified
- Locale - the primary language for collecting information from suppliers
- Passwords, logins, and server addresses for external connections
- Internal project paths

The class is called as a singleton instance `gs`:
```python
from __init__ import gs
"""
...

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__,  __doc__, __details__

from .credentials import gs
from .header import __root__
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original code had a placeholder `_____________settings`.  This has been replaced with `global_settings`. This is a more standard and descriptive name for a file containing project configuration settings.  Using `global_settings` makes the purpose of the file immediately apparent.

**Crucial Considerations (Not Directly in the Code, but Important):**

* **`__init__.py` Structure:**  The `__init__.py` files are crucial for Python packages.  This particular `__init__.py` file should import the `ProjectSettings` class and likely any other necessary objects from a `global_settings.py` or `project_settings.py` file.  This is *very* important; otherwise the module will not be loaded or work correctly.

* **`ProjectSettings` Class:** The code mentions a `ProjectSetting` class.  This likely contains the actual settings. This needs to be implemented within a file like `global_settings.py` (or `project_settings.py`).  Create it and define the settings mentioned in the docstring.

* **`gs` Singleton:** The code references `gs` as a singleton instance.   This suggests you have a way to create a single, globally accessible instance of `ProjectSettings`. You will need to handle the singleton instantiation and access in your `global_settings.py` file. This often involves using a design pattern like a factory or a classmethod to ensure only one instance is created.

* **Error Handling:** Consider error handling (e.g., file not found, invalid data) for reading configuration files.

* **Security:**  If `credentials` are part of these settings, implement robust security measures (e.g., encryption) for storing sensitive information, *especially* passwords. Do *not* store passwords directly in plaintext.  Use appropriate libraries for secure storage (e.g., cryptography).

* **Code Completeness:** The `...` indicates missing code.  You need to fill in the actual implementation of the `ProjectSettings` class, the `__init__.py` file (for the module to work), and a method to instantiate and access `gs`.

* **File Structure:**  Organize your files to match a reasonable Python package structure. The updated file name is part of a better structure for a Python project.
