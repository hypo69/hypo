# Improved Code

```python
# ... (previous improved code) ...
```

# Changes Made

*   Added missing import `from pathlib import Path`.
*   Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
*   Added import `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for loading settings from `settings.json`.
*   Added `try...except` blocks for handling potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during file reading and logging errors using `logger.error`.
*   Added RST-style docstrings for `set_project_root` function and module-level docstring.
*   Added variable `project_root` to make code more readable and clear.
*   Used `Path` objects consistently for file paths.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for potential errors (e.g. missing `settings.json` or invalid format).
*   Use `read_text` method instead of `.read()` for file reading so that file encoding issues are handled correctly.
*   Initialized `settings` and `doc_str` to empty dictionaries/strings in the `except` blocks to handle the missing or invalid files gracefully.
