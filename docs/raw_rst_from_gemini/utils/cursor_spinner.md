**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Docstrings:**  Improved docstrings for clarity and added a `Raises` section specifying potential `TypeError`. This is crucial for good documentation.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block around the `show_spinner` function. This is essential.  The `spinning_cursor` generator theoretically never stops, so we added a `StopIteration` handler to gracefully handle the case where it's used incorrectly.
* **Type Hinting:** Explicitly added type hints for `duration` and `delay` which improve readability and maintainability.
* **TypeError Handling:** Included a `TypeError` to prevent unexpected behavior if non-float values are used.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved formatting and variable names for better readability.

**How to Use:**

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

This revised code is more robust, handles potential errors, and provides better documentation for others (and yourself) to use the module.  It is best practice to always include error handling in production code.
