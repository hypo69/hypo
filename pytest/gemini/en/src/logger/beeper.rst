**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Explicitly import the necessary classes from the `hypotez/src/logger/beeper.py` file, improving maintainability.

2. **Fixtures:**  Created `beeper_instance` and `test_record` fixtures to provide instances and data for testing.  This improves code organization and makes tests more reusable.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Used `pytest.raises` to test exception handling in `beep`, verifying that specific exceptions are caught as expected and  including assertions that check for specific error messages.  This is crucial for robustness.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included tests for various valid and invalid `level` inputs (both `BeepLevel` enums and strings), different frequencies and durations, and the `silent_mode` decorator.

5. **Edge Case Tests:** Added a test (`test_beep_invalid_level`) to cover a case where an invalid `level` string is provided to the `beep` method. This checks the expected exception handling.  Also added `test_beep_with_frequency_duration`.

6. **Clear Test Function Names:**  The test names are now more descriptive and accurately reflect the test case's purpose.

7. **Comments:** Added comments explaining the purpose of each test case, making the test suite easier to understand.

8. **Exception Message Assertions:** In `test_beep_invalid_level` and `test_play_sound_exception_handling`, assertions are added to check the exception messages, confirming that the correct error message is printed when exceptions are raised.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_beeper.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/logger/beeper.py` file (or adjust the import paths accordingly).
3.  Run `pytest test_beeper.py` from your terminal.

**Further Enhancements (Important):**

* **Testing `emit`:** Add tests for the `emit` method,  passing different records with various `level` values and asserting the appropriate sounds are played.
* **Asyncio:**  The `beep` function is asynchronous. Make sure your tests are using `asyncio.run()` correctly to run the asynchronous code in a way that pytest understands.
* **Specific Output Assertions:**  In tests for `emit` and `beep`, verify that the correct sound frequencies and durations are actually emitted.  You might need to modify your code to provide feedback about the playing notes.
* **More Invalid Input Cases:** Include tests for other invalid input scenarios that the `Beeper` class might handle.
* **Concurrency:** If your system uses threads or concurrency, test how the `Beeper` class handles concurrent calls to `beep`.
* **Mocking:** For more complex interactions, consider mocking the `winsound.Beep` function to isolate the `Beeper` class and make your tests more robust.
