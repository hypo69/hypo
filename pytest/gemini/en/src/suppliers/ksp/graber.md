**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the `Driver` class and potentially other classes/functions used by `Graber` are now mocked using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`. This is essential for testing asynchronous code in `pytest` and avoids actually interacting with the browser or external services. This prevents tests from hanging and provides a predictable environment.  I've added a `MockDriver` class to mock the async methods (e.g., `execute_locator`)


2. **Fixtures:** I've created fixtures `graber` and `product_fields` for cleaner test setup.

3. **`pytest.raises`:** I've added a `test_grab_page_invalid_input` that uses `pytest.raises` to check if the function raises an expected exception.  This is a more robust approach than relying on `assert` for error conditions.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive.

5. **Mock Driver Return Value:** The `MockDriver` class now handles the asynchronous methods.  Importantly, it's now designed to return the expected result (in this case, the `ProductFields` instance.)

6. **Edge Case and Error Handling:**  The `test_grab_page_invalid_input` now checks for a meaningful exception message to ensure that the code is not silently failing with an unknown issue.

7. **Empty Input Test:** Added a `test_grab_page_empty_input` to handle the scenario where some or all input parameters to the internal `fetch_all_data` function are empty strings, handling the possible failure gracefully.

8. **Robustness:** The error handling within the mock now ensures that a more meaningful error message is provided in case of failure.

**Important Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **Specific Function Tests:**  The provided code has numerous internal functions (`id_product`, etc.). You need to write individual test cases for each of these to ensure they are handling their expected parameters and returning valid data.  These would follow the same mocking and fixture structure as the `grab_page` tests.
* **Data-Driven Tests:**  Consider using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different valid and invalid data inputs with the `id_product`, etc. functions.  That will allow you to write fewer repetitive tests, covering a larger range of input possibilities.
* **Assertions:** Write assertions to check the correct functionality and values returned by each function.


**How to Run the Tests:**


1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the tests in a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_graber.py
   ```

Remember to adapt the mocks and assertions to accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions you are testing. Remember to add tests for every function and method within the Graber class, mocking out the calls to `await` functions and any external calls, returning appropriate data. This is crucial to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
