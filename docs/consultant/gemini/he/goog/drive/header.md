```

**Changes Made**

- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Changed `json.load` to `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added more descriptive variable names (e.g., `project_root`).
- Replaced `__root__` with `project_root` for better readability.
- Added explicit error handling with `logger.error` for both `settings.json` and `README.MD` loading, preventing silent failures.
- Included `:type` hints where appropriate.
- Improved and enhanced the docstrings.
- Added `TODO` items for potential improvements.
- Fixed typo in `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Added more explicit error messages in the exception handling.
- Implemented more robust error handling and logging to improve the reliability of the code.
