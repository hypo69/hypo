```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing imports (`from src.logger import logger`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`).
- Wrapped `try-except` blocks around JSON loading with `logger.error` for improved error handling.  This reduces the use of blanket `except Exception`.
- Added RST documentation to `load_data` and `load_data_nested` functions.
- Renamed `json.load` to `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` for consistency.
- Added detailed comments on potential improvements (`TODO`).
- Renamed `data.json` to `filepath` for better parameterization.
- Replaced `...` placeholders in the provided code with appropriate comments.
- Added informative docstrings to functions using RST format.
