```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests and avoids side effects.  Critically, `tmp_path` is used for creating temporary directories, a best practice in pytest.

2.  **Parameterization:** Using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with various marker file names in `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file`.

3.  **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included tests for various scenarios:
    *   Valid project structure with marker files.
    *   Nested project structures.
    *   Cases where no marker files are found (which should return the current directory).
    *   Marker files in a parent directory.
    *   Multiple marker files.
    *   Invalid marker file names.
    *   Handling cases where no files exist at all.

4.  **Clearer Assertions:** Used more specific assertions like checking for equality with `assert root_dir == tmp_path` for better readability and error messages.

5.  **Error Handling:**  The original code had `...` in the `try...except` blocks.  This was improved by replacing `...` with more specific error handling within `test_set_project_root_*` functions and avoiding global side effects.

6. **Avoiding Global Variables:** The tests now directly use the `set_project_root` function without relying on potentially changing global variables like `__root__`.

7.  **Using `tmp_path`:** The tests utilize `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary files and directories, essential for avoiding conflicts and maintaining test isolation.

This improved solution provides more comprehensive test coverage and adheres to best practices for writing maintainable and reliable tests. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, and `pathlib`.  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a file exists with that name in the project).  Make sure the `hypotez` directory and `gs` module is present according to your project structure.
