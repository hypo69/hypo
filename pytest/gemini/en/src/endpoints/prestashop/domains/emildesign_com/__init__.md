```python

# Tests for the __init__.py file (which currently only defines constants)
def test_mode_is_dev():
    """Checks that the MODE constant is set to 'dev'."""
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains.emildesign_com import MODE
    assert MODE == 'dev', "MODE should be 'dev'."

#  No other functions or methods are present in the input code, so no other tests are needed.
#  This is a minimal test suite.  If more logic is present, more comprehensive tests should be added.
