## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/version.py

This file, `version.py`, defines versioning information for the `aliexpress` GUI module within the `hypotez` project.  It's designed to be imported and used by other parts of the application to determine the current version.

**Key Variables and Attributes:**

* **`__version__`:**  This string holds the version number of the module (`"3.12.0.0.0.4"`).  It's crucial for version control and compatibility checks.  If you are updating the version, change this value.


* **`__name__`:** This attribute is usually a string, e.g., `"__main__"` if the script is run directly or the module name if imported.

* **`__doc__`:** This docstring provides a brief description of the module's purpose ("Графический интерфейс для управления рекламными кампаниями").  It's important for documentation and user understanding.

* **`__details__`:** This variable, currently empty (`f"""  """`), is intended to hold more detailed information about the module.  Fill this in with informative details.


* **`__annotations__`:**  This variable is currently empty.  If there are type hints (annotations) for functions or variables within the module, they would be stored here.


* **`__author__`:** This attribute holds the name of the module's author ("hypotez").

**How to Use:**

You typically *don't* interact with this file directly.  Instead, you import it in other parts of your application:

```python
from suppliers.aliexpress.gui import version

print(version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(version.__name__)  # Output: (the module's name if imported) or __main__ if executed
print(version.__doc__)  # Output: Графический интерфейс для управления рекламными кампаниями
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Versioning:**  Following a consistent versioning scheme (e.g., `major.minor.patch.build.etc`) is crucial for tracking changes and ensuring compatibility across different versions.

* **Documentation:**  The `__doc__` and `__details__` are important for maintainability.  Provide thorough descriptions.

* **Type Hints (`__annotations__`):**  Consider adding type hints to improve code readability and help with static analysis.  This is good practice, especially in larger projects.


* **File Structure:**  The file is located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/version.py`. This suggests a modular design; the `version.py` file is specifically designed to hold version information for the `aliexpress` GUI.
