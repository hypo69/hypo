**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_valid`, `test_version_attribute_types`).

2. **Attribute Existence Checks:** `test_version_attributes_exist` verifies that all the documented attributes (`__version__`, `__name__`, etc.) are present. This is crucial for ensuring the module's structure is as expected.

3. **Type Assertions:** `test_version_attribute_types` now checks the types of attributes (`__version__`, `MODE`, etc.) to ensure they conform to the expected types (e.g., string, etc.).  This important addition covers a crucial aspect of validation.

4. **Exception Handling (Crucial):**  `test_version_name_not_raising_exception` is a *crucial* addition, demonstrating how to test for exceptions that *shouldn't* be raised. This is vital for robustness.

5. **Non-Existent Attribute Test:** `test_nonexistent_attribute` is added to catch situations where an attribute might not exist (a common cause of errors in production code).


6. **Incorrect Attribute Type Test (Example):** `test_incorrect_attribute_type` shows how to test if an attribute has the *wrong* type. Replace the placeholder comment with a relevant test if the `__details__` attribute should be of a specific type (e.g. a dictionary or a specific class).


**How to Run:**

Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as `version.py`.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).  Then run:

```bash
pytest test_version.py
```


This revised test suite provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests for your code, addressing both expected and potential error scenarios. Remember to adapt the `test_incorrect_attribute_type` section to reflect the actual expected type of the `__details__` attribute. Also, if there are any specific types the attributes are supposed to be (strings, numbers, custom classes, etc), be sure to add those tests to cover those scenarios.
