**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs`:** The `MockGs` class now effectively mocks the `gs` module.  This is crucial because `gs` isn't defined in the provided code and you can't directly test it. This avoids needing to modify `gs` for testing.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, e.g., `test_set_project_root_project_in_parent`.

3. **Robust File Handling:** The test cases now use `Path` objects consistently to create and remove temporary files and directories, which are properly cleaned up after each test.  The `clean_mock_files` fixture handles this cleanup, preventing issues like file system pollution.

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The example test `test_settings_load_file_not_found` now demonStartes proper exception handling, ensuring that the code gracefully handles a `FileNotFoundError`.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover various scenarios: valid inputs, parent directory, multiple marker files, and cases where no root is found.

6. **Avoid using `sys.path`:** `sys.path` should be modified and restored by each test, not across several test cases, to avoid altering future tests.

7. **Reproducible Tests**: The code now makes sure to create the necessary files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`) in the specific locations for each test.

8. **Error Handling for Settings:** Now tests for correct handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` within the setting loading section.

This improved solution provides a complete and robust test suite for the `set_project_root` function, making it much more effective at ensuring the function works correctly in a variety of situations. Remember to replace `"./"` with the actual path to your `pyproject.toml` file, if needed.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved test suite is more effective at detecting bugs and ensuring the code functions as intended. Remember to install the necessary packages (`pytest`, `packaging` if you haven't already): `pip install pytest packaging`
