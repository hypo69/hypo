**Prompt for Writing `pytest` Tests**

Write test cases for the following Python code using the `pytest` library. The tests should cover the main functions, methods, or classes to verify their correctness. Include edge cases and exception handling where appropriate.

**Requirements:**
1. Use clear and descriptive test function names that indicate their purpose.
2. Ensure all tests are isolated and independent of one another.
3. Consider various scenarios, including:
   - Valid inputs.
   - Invalid or unexpected inputs, where applicable.
   - Edge or boundary cases.
4. Use `pytest.raises` for exception testing.
5. If fixtures are needed for the functions, define them separately.
6. Add comments explaining the logic of the test cases.

Example structure for the tests:

```python
import pytest

# Fixture definitions, if needed
@pytest.fixture
def example_data():
    """Provides test data for the function."""
    return {...}

# Tests for Function 1
def test_function1_valid_input():
    """Checks correct behavior with valid input."""
    ...

def test_function1_invalid_input():
    """Checks correct handling of invalid input."""
    ...

# Tests for Function 2
def test_function2_edge_case():
    """Checks behavior with edge cases."""
    ...
```

Input code:

```python
# The user-provided code goes here
...
```

Create a comprehensive set of test cases based on the given code.
```
```

**2. <algorithm>**

There's no actual code provided to analyze. The prompt is asking for a *template* for writing pytest tests.  A step-by-step algorithm for *generating* tests cannot be presented in a block diagram format.  The process is as follows:

1. **Identify the code to be tested:**  The user needs to provide the Python code (functions, classes, etc.) for which the tests should be created.
2. **Design Test Cases:**  This is a crucial step. The user needs to consider various input scenarios for the code:
    * **Valid Inputs:**  Normal use-case examples.
    * **Invalid Inputs:**  Test edge cases like incorrect data types, empty values, out-of-range inputs, etc.  This step is paramount.
    * **Boundary Conditions:** Inputs at the extreme edges of the valid range (minimum, maximum values)
3. **Implement the Tests:** Create pytest test functions (`test_...` naming convention).  Use `assert` statements within the functions to verify the expected behavior.
4. **Handle Exceptions:**  Use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.
5. **Document the Tests:** Use docstrings (`"""Docstring explaining the purpose of the test"""`) within test functions to explain the test's functionality.
6. **Use Fixtures:** Define functions that will prepare data for testing as fixtures if required (e.g., creating test data).


**3. <explanation>**

* **Imports:** There are no imports in the code.  The prompt is asking you to write pytest tests *that* will likely use the `pytest` module.  The provided structure correctly imports `pytest`.

* **Classes:** The prompt details a structure for writing test *functions* (not classes).  The example shows `@pytest.fixture` for creating test data, which is a function, not a class.

* **Functions:** The example provides test function templates like `test_function1_valid_input`.  These functions need to be filled in with `assert` statements to verify the user-supplied code's behavior.

* **Variables:**  Variables are part of the user-supplied code.  Tests in pytest will utilize data from these user-supplied variables, which need to be tested thoroughly by the tests.

* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**
    * **Missing User Code:** The most significant error is the lack of user code.  Without that, the test cases are just templates, which are worthless without a corresponding implementation to test.
    * **Comprehensive Testing:**  Adequate test coverage requires exploring various data types, boundary conditions (min/max values), exceptional cases, and combinations of inputs.  Missing these details leads to incomplete test suites.
    * **Clear Assertions:**  Test assertions should be clear and specific; they should directly verify the expected behavior, rather than just indirectly measuring it.  Avoid assertions like `assert result is True`. Ensure the assertion tests something like `assert result == expected_result`.

* **Chain of Relationships:** The prompt's focus is on creating isolated tests for *user-provided* functions and classes, so there's no relationship to other parts of a larger project described here, as that's the focus of the prompt.  The relationship is that the pytest tests verify the functionality of the user's code.

The prompt is a request to *write* pytest tests, not *explain* existing ones.  The explanation section focuses on best practices for the *creation* of tests.
