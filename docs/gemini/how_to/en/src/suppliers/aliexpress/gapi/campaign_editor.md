This Python script, `campaign_editor.py`, appears to be part of a larger system for managing advertising campaigns on AliExpress using Google Sheets.  It likely interacts with Google's API to access and modify data in spreadsheets.  Let's break down a potential usage guide based on the current code:

**Usage Guide for `campaign_editor.py`**

This script likely serves as a core component for managing campaign data.  To utilize it, you'll need a working environment (likely a virtual environment) configured with the necessary dependencies (including the Google Sheets API library).

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Virtual Environment:**  Ensure a Python virtual environment is activated (`venv/Scripts/python.exe` or `venv/bin/python/python3.12`).
2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup:**  You need a GCP project and the Google Sheets API enabled within that project.  You'll need to obtain API credentials and configure the `src.google` module (likely containing the necessary Google Sheets API client library).
3. **`header.py`:** This script imports `header.py`, indicating that this file contains essential functions or constants used by `campaign_editor.py`.  Understanding `header.py`'s functionality is critical for using `campaign_editor.py`.


**Usage Example (Conceptual):**

```python
# Assuming 'header.py' handles authentication
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.gapi.campaign_editor import *  # Or specific functions as needed
from src.google import SpreadSheet


# Example of creating a new campaign entry
def create_campaign(campaign_name, target_audience, budget):
    """
    Creates a new campaign entry in the specified Google Sheet.

    Args:
        campaign_name (str): The name of the campaign.
        target_audience (str): The target audience for the campaign.
        budget (float): The budget allocated for the campaign.
    """
    # Create an instance of Spreadsheet class (from src.google) using the authenticated service
    sheet = SpreadSheet("your_spreadsheet_id", "your_sheet_name")

    # Insert the data into the spreadsheet
    sheet.insert_campaign_data({"campaign_name": campaign_name, "target_audience": target_audience, "budget": budget})

# Example Usage
create_campaign("Winter Campaign", "Women 25-35", 1000)


# Example of updating campaign status.
def update_campaign_status(campaign_id, new_status):
    sheet = SpreadSheet("your_spreadsheet_id", "your_sheet_name")
    sheet.update_campaign_status(campaign_id, new_status)
```

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This likely defines a development mode, which might affect how the script behaves in a different context.
* **`src.google`:**  This part of the script handles interactions with Google Sheets.  You need a well-structured `src.google` module.  It likely contains classes or functions for authenticating and interacting with spreadsheets.
* **`SpreadSheet` class (in `src.google`):**  Crucial for connecting to and working with Google Sheets.  It should have methods for reading, writing, and updating data within specific sheets.

**Missing Information and Next Steps:**

* **`header.py` content:** The complete function of `header.py` is critical.
* **`SpreadSheet` methods:**  The details of the `SpreadSheet` class's functions need specification (e.g., `insert_campaign_data`, `update_campaign_status`).
* **Error handling:**  The example lacks error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) which is essential in production code.
* **Authentication:** The code snippets lack the process for authenticating with the Google Sheets API.
* **Data Validation:**  How does the script ensure that the data inserted is valid?


To further refine this usage guide, provide the code for `header.py` and relevant details from the `src.google` module.


This improved guide provides a framework for understanding and using the script, but more concrete information is needed for a complete and functional guide.
