**Explanation of Improvements and Fixes:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block around `get_project_root()`.  Crucially, it now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the project root isn't found. This is much better than silently failing.  The `except` block prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code (1), indicating an error to the calling program.

2. **`Path` Usage Consistency:** Made `__root__` a `Path` object, and consistently used `Path` throughout the function.   This is better than using `str` for paths; it promotes type safety and makes the code cleaner.

3. **Correct `sys.path` Insertion:** Changed `sys.path.insert(0, __root__)` to `sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))`. This is crucial; `sys.path` expects strings, not `Path` objects.

4. **Import `Playwright`:** Fixed the typo in the `Playwrid` import to `Playwright`.

5. **Explicit `Version` Import:** Removed the import of `Version` from `packaging.version` since it's not used anymore. If you need `Version`, import it where you use it in your code.

6. **Docstring Improvement:** Included a `FileNotFoundError` in the docstring's `Returns` section to warn about potential errors.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:** The error handling makes the script more reliable by preventing silent failures and helping to identify the cause of problems.
* **Clarity and Maintainability:** Using `Path` objects consistently improves code readability and maintainability.
* **Correctness:**  The fix for `sys.path` prevents the script from failing unexpectedly when trying to insert the path.
* **Pythonic:** The improved code adheres better to Python's best practices and common idioms.


This improved version is significantly more robust and reliable than the original. Remember to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install packaging
```

This complete, fixed code is ready to be used. Remember to adjust the `marker_files` tuple if your project uses different identifiers.
