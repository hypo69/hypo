<input code>
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. The code imports the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
2. A function `add_numbers` is defined, taking two arguments `a` and `b`.
3. Inside `add_numbers`, the `calculate_sum` function is called with `a` and `b` as arguments.  The result is stored in the `result` variable.
4. The function returns the value of `result`.

Example:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
- Algorithm: `calculate_sum(5, 3)` is executed.
- Result: The returned value from `calculate_sum` (which would be 8) is returned by `add_numbers`.
</algorithm>

<explanation>
**Imports**:
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `src.utils` package.  This suggests a modular design where the `calculator` module provides utility functions for mathematical calculations.  The `src` prefix implies this is part of a larger source code project.


**Function `add_numbers`**:
- **Purpose**: This function is designed to add two numbers. It does not perform any calculations itself, instead delegating the addition to the `calculate_sum` function.
- **Arguments**:
    - `a`: Represents the first number to be added.
    - `b`: Represents the second number to be added.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`, which is calculated by `calculate_sum`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # sum_result will hold the value 8
```

**Relationship with Other Packages**:
The `add_numbers` function relies on the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module. This demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with `add_numbers` handling the higher-level task of adding numbers and `calculate_sum` handling the specific addition calculation.

**Potential Improvements**:
- **Error Handling**: The code lacks error handling. If `calculate_sum` is expected to raise errors (e.g., if inputs are not numbers), `add_numbers` should include error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.  This could involve checking the type of `a` and `b` or catching exceptions raised by `calculate_sum`.
- **Type Hinting**: Adding type hints would improve readability and maintainability.  For example, `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:` would clearly specify the expected types of the arguments and the return value.
- **Documentation**: Adding a docstring to the `add_numbers` function would provide a concise explanation of its purpose, arguments, return value, and any preconditions.
