```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest` Structure:** The code now follows the `pytest` structure, with test functions clearly defined and using descriptive names.

2. **WebDriver Fixture:** A `@pytest.fixture` called `driver` is introduced to create and manage a Firefox webdriver instance. This ensures that each test gets its own fresh browser session, preventing issues of stale elements or state from previous tests.  Crucially, it also cleans up after each test (`.quit()`).

3. **Error Handling and Assertions:** The `test_borderify_invalid_border` test case now uses a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions raised by invalid border styles and fails the test appropriately. The previous versions either didn't handle exceptions or didn't correctly assert failures for expected errors.

4. **Explicit Waits (Crucial):**  `test_borderify_alert_explicit_wait` now uses `WebDriverWait` to wait for the alert before interacting with it. This is essential to prevent `TimeoutError` failures when the alert is not displayed immediately.

5. **Edge Cases:**  `test_borderify_empty_style` demonstrates how to test for an empty style, or a completely invalid style, in `test_borderify_invalid_border`.

6. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are now more specific and focused on the expected behavior of the JavaScript code, for example, `assert border_style == "5px solid red"` instead of just checking that the style is not `None`.

7. **No Test Environment Setup:** This example does not create a dummy HTML page;  this is correct for a simple JavaScript script, but if your `borderify.js` script relies on some DOM, then you will need setup to create a test environment and to inject the script into the page.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Install necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
    ```
2.  Install the geckodriver for Firefox:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install webdriver-manager
    pip install webdriver-manager
    ```
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_borderify.py
    ```

Remember to replace `"test_borderify.py"` with the actual name of your test file if different.  This corrected and improved version should work correctly for testing your JavaScript code.  The main addition is the handling of various error conditions that are more robustly tested.
