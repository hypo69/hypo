**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **`js2py`:** The provided JavaScript code directly manipulates the DOM.  Testing that requires DOM interaction needs to be executed in an environment that can simulate browser behavior.  `js2py` is used to execute the JavaScript code within a Python environment.

2. **Simulated DOM:** The test attempts to simulate the DOM.  Crucially, without a browser or a proper DOM mocking library, the code can't directly assert on the actual effects on the DOM. The assertion `assert js_env, "Execution of the javascript code failed"` now verifies if `js2py` successfully executes the JavaScript code.  Real-world tests would involve Selenium or a similar framework to get access and verify DOM changes.

3. **Exception Handling (Placeholder):**  The `test_borderify_no_errors` test is a placeholder.  While the provided JavaScript doesn't *explicitly* throw errors, real-world JavaScript code might. In the absence of a simulated browser, we can't directly verify if exceptions are raised. 

4. **Real-World Testing:** Testing browser code effectively requires setting up a proper testing environment.   Selenium or similar tools are needed to handle the browser (and thus, the DOM), and test cases would likely target changes visible in the browser window (or through browser API calls).

5. **`alert()`:** The `alert()` function is important because it's a fundamental browser interaction.  However, in a simplified testing environment (without a browser window), the effect of `alert()` is often not immediately apparent, and direct testing of the `alert()` function in this code would need a more complete setup.


**To make this more robust:**

- **Selenium:** Use a Selenium framework to simulate the browser and interact with the DOM.  This allows direct assertion on the presence and properties of the modified DOM elements.

- **Mock DOM:**  If possible, mock the `document` object to isolate the JavaScript code.  This is often part of a comprehensive JavaScript testing solution.


This revised solution addresses the limitations of testing JavaScript DOM manipulation in a Python environment while offering the most realistic approach possible without a full browser environment. Remember to install `js2py`:
```bash
pip install js2py
```
