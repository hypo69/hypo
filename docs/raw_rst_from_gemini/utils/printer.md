"""
This module provides enhanced print formatting for better readability of data structures.
It supports pretty-printing of dictionaries, lists, objects, and reading from CSV/XLS/XLSX files 
with customization for handling `Path` objects and class instances, along with color, background, and font styling.

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The most significant change is the addition of `try...except` blocks around potentially problematic code sections (e.g., file reading, CSV/XLS processing). This prevents the script from crashing if there's an issue like a file not found, incorrect file format, or other errors.  Crucially, this now prints a meaningful error message.
* **Color Input Validation:** The code now has proper validation for the `text_color`, `bg_color`, and `font_style` inputs. This is important to prevent cryptic errors or unexpected results if a user enters an invalid color code.  This is done in a more efficient way, by accessing the `color` attribute of `sys.stdout`. This is better than hardcoding all possible colors because it can use platform-specific ANSI codes if necessary.
* **Reduced Redundancy:** The handling of file types (CSV, XLS, text) is now more concise.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of specific code blocks and variables.


**How to Run (crucial):**

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

2.  **Ensure a Virtual Environment (strongly recommended):**  If you don't have a virtual environment, create one. This prevents dependency conflicts with other projects.  The `#!` line at the top of `printer.py` should match the Python interpreter in your virtual environment.

3.  **Run from a terminal:**


```bash
python your_script.py
```

This revised code is significantly more robust, handling potential errors gracefully and preventing unexpected behavior.  It's also more easily maintainable. Remember to replace `"your_script.py"` with the actual name of your Python file. Always test with various input cases, especially files that may not exist or contain errors.
