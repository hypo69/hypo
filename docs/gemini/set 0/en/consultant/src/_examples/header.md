Module for retrieving project settings and metadata.
=========================================================================================

This module contains functions to retrieve project settings from `settings.json` and
metadata like version, name, author, and copyright information.
It uses the `set_project_root` function to correctly find the project's root directory,
and integrates it with `src.logger` for error handling.

# Changes Made

*   Added missing imports `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`, `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to the `set_project_root` and `get_project_settings` functions.
*   Improved error handling using `logger.error` for more informative error messages.
*   Removed unnecessary comments and clarified existing comments.
*   Renamed `settings_file` variables to more descriptive names (e.g., `settings_path`).
*   Added a `get_project_readme` function for better separation of concerns.
*   Enhanced error handling for file reading and JSON decoding in `get_project_settings`. Now includes proper error logging.
