**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial change is mocking the `PrestaShop` class and any other external dependencies. This isolates the `PrestaWarehouse` class from external calls, preventing unexpected behavior or needing to have a full PrestaShop environment for testing.
2. **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` makes the tests more concise and easier to maintain by running the same test with various inputs.
3. **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test if the correct exception is raised when expected.  Critically, we now test that the exception is raised with the correct *message*.
4. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now use more specific assertions to check the return values.

**How to use this with your actual code:**

1. **Replace the Mock Classes and methods:**  Substitute the `MockPrestaShop` and `mock` calls with the actual code and method calls from your `prestashop/warehouse.py`.

2. **Replace Mock Data:**  Add `mock.MagicMock` instances to mock the behavior of any external dependencies.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Actual `PrestaShop` dependencies:**  This solution mocks `PrestaShop`. If `PrestaShop` interacts with external services (databases, web requests), make sure these are also mocked in your tests.
- **Exception Handling in the Actual Code:**  Ensure the `PrestaWarehouse` class has proper exception handling.  The example includes a test for that.
- **Complex Logic:** If the logic in your actual `some_method` is complex, you'll need more intricate mocks and test cases.


This improved solution is significantly better because it directly tests the core logic of the `PrestaWarehouse` class without needing an actual PrestaShop environment. Remember to adapt the example to match the imports and function calls in your actual code.
