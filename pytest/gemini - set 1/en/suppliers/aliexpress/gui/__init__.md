**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder:**  The provided code has no functions or classes to test. The example tests are general and illuStarte how to write tests for `__version__`, `__doc__` and `__details__` attributes. **Replace** the empty placeholder with the actual code from your `aliexpress/gui/__init__.py` file.

2. **Specific Tests:**  The example test cases are basic checks for data types and emptiness.  **Crucially**, you need to write tests that verify the **functionality** of the code in your `aliexpress/gui/__init__.py` file.  Add tests for any methods, functions, or classes you want to validate.

3. **Versioning:**  The test `test_version_is_valid_version` attempts to parse the version string. It's important to test that your version string is in a valid format. `packaging.version` is used for this purpose.  Also, in real-world applications, you often have logic to test compatibility with other versions or packages. The example `test_compatibility_with_specific_version` demonStartes this kind of test.

4. **Edge Cases:** You should add tests to check for unexpected input, boundary values, or special conditions that your code might encounter.  This is crucial for robust testing.

5. **Exceptions:** If your functions raise exceptions for invalid input, you should use `pytest.raises` to test the exception handling.

6. **Fixtures:** If you need to use the same data repeatedly in your tests, define them as fixtures.


Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing your test file. This will execute the tests. If you have any other specific code logic, add the needed tests for checking that logic.
