**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_mode_constant`:** This test verifies that the `MODE` constant is defined and is a string.  Crucially, it checks for the validity of the MODE.
2. **`test_mode_value`:**  This test uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with different valid and invalid values ( `dev`, `prod`, `test` ) of `MODE`, and handles an exception with `pytest.fail` for better informative error messages. This is a much better approach than just asserting one value.
3. **Example Fixture (commented out):** A commented-out example of a fixture shows how to use `monkeypatch` to temporarily change the value of a constant for testing purposes (if needed in future).   Important for testing code that depends on the mode value.
4. **Edge Case `test_mode_invalid_type`:** This test specifically checks for the case where the `MODE` constant is assigned a non-string value, ensuring the code handles that appropriately by raising a `TypeError` (as it should).
5. **Clearer comments:**  Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_logger.py`) in the same directory as your `logger.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest` from your terminal in that directory.

This revised solution now covers the crucial aspects of testing the code and provides much more robust testing.  The key improvement is handling *all* possible cases of `MODE` to make sure that the code is correct regardless of the value used. Remember to replace placeholders and adjust tests as needed according to the actual functions in your `logger.py`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`monkeypatch`:** If your `logger.py` depends on external libraries or processes that the test case does *not* provide, you'll need to use `monkeypatch` to simulate their behaviour within the test environment to prevent external dependencies from affecting the tests (as shown in the example fixture). This can be critical for making the tests isolated and reliable.
* **File Existence:** If the code in `logger.py` relies on external files or configurations, consider adding tests that check for their existence or contents.  This is another important way that code can be tested when external factors are involved.
* **Additional Tests:** Consider other possible scenarios and behaviours that might arise in your code, like what happens when `MODE` is initially undefined. The additional test cases you write, including boundary and edge case handling, will make your test suite more robust.
