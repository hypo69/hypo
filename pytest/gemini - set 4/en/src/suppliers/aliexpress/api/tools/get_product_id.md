**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, e.g., `test_get_product_id_valid_input_complex`.

2. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:**  Added tests for empty input (`test_get_product_id_empty_input`), invalid input (`test_get_product_id_invalid_input`), non-string input (`test_get_product_id_non_string_input`), and URLs without a product ID (`test_get_product_id_no_product_id_in_url`).

3. **Exception Handling:**  Uses `pytest.raises` correctly to assert that the `ProductIdNotFoundException` is raised with the appropriate message when expected.

4. **Mocking (Crucial):** The `test_extract_prod_ids_raises_exception` and `test_get_product_id_with_mocked_extract_prod_ids`  tests are critical.  They isolate `get_product_id` from the potentially problematic `extract_prod_ids` function by mocking it.  This is essential for testing the *behavior* of `get_product_id` without relying on external dependencies that might not be readily available or stable during testing.


5. **`parametrize` for various inputs:** The last test uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to concisely run tests with different input combinations, making tests more efficient. This was missing in the initial response.  Remember to import `pytest.mark.parametrize` if you don't have it.

6. **Correct ValueError:** The test for empty input now uses `pytest.raises(ValueError)` because `extract_prod_ids` may raise `ValueError`.

7. **Handling of Exception Propagation:** The code demonstrates the correct way to handle the possible exception from `extract_prod_ids`, and it is more robust as it doesn't rely on making assumptions about `extract_prod_ids` throwing `ProductIdNotFoundException` only.


This revised solution is far more robust and accurately tests the core logic of `get_product_id`, ensuring it correctly handles various situations and propagates exceptions as expected. Remember to adjust the expected output or exception types based on the actual behavior of `extract_prod_ids`. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
