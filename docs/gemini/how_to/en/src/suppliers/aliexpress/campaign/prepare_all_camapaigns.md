## Usage Guide for `prepare_all_campaigns.py`

This script, located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/prepare_all_camapaigns.py`, prepares all AliExpress campaigns for affiliate creation.  If a campaign doesn't already exist, it will be created.

**File:** `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/prepare_all_camapaigns.py`

**Purpose:**  This script automates the process of verifying and potentially creating affiliate campaigns for AliExpress.


**How to Use:**

1. **Python Environment:** Ensure you have a Python environment set up (e.g., a virtual environment) with the necessary packages installed.  The script uses `header` and `process_all_campaigns` modules.  The shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`) indicate the required Python interpreter.

2. **Dependencies:**  The script imports `header` and `process_all_campaigns`. These modules should be defined and correctly implemented in the `src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign` package in your project structure.  If these modules are not found, the script will fail.


3. **Execution:**  Run the script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python prepare_all_campaigns.py
   ```

**Explanation:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely determines the execution mode (e.g., development vs. production).
* **`process_all_campaigns()`:** This is the core function responsible for checking and creating campaigns.  The detailed implementation of this function is found in the `process_all_campaigns.py` file within the `src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign` directory.  Understanding the logic within `process_all_campaigns` is crucial for troubleshooting or modifying the campaign creation process.


**Troubleshooting:**

* **Import Errors:** If you get `ImportError` messages, check that the `header` and `process_all_campaigns` modules exist in the correct location within your project's source code.
* **Module Errors:** Ensure `process_all_campaigns()` is properly defined and functions correctly to create or check campaigns. Investigate the errors raised by `process_all_campaigns()` if it encounters issues during execution.
* **Environment Variables:** Check for any environment variables that `process_all_campaigns` might require.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  `prepare_all_campaigns.py` currently lacks explicit error handling. Consider adding `try...except` blocks to catch and report potential issues (e.g., database connection problems).
* **Logging:** Implementing logging would significantly enhance debugging.  This would allow you to track the progress of the script, identify failures, and better understand the logic within `process_all_campaigns`.
* **Testing:**  Write unit tests for `process_all_campaigns` to ensure the script functions correctly and prevent regressions as the project evolves.

By understanding the role of `process_all_campaigns` and addressing the potential issues, you can effectively use this script for managing AliExpress affiliate campaigns.
