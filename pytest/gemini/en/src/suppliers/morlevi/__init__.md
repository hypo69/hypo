```

**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **`@pytest.fixture` for Data:** The example now uses a fixture (`example_data`) to provide data for tests. This is crucial for organization and reusability.  Replace the example data with realistic data relevant to the `Graber` class.

2. **Specific `Graber` Assertions:** The `test_graber_valid_input` test now has a placeholder.  **You MUST replace this with the *actual* assertions you need based on how the `Graber` class works.**  For instance, if `Graber` returns a dictionary, you'd check the dictionary's contents; if it returns a value, you'd compare that to the expected value.

3. **Exception Handling:**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically test exception handling. This is essential for checking that the code correctly handles errors.  The error types are placeholders; replace them with the actual exceptions the `Graber` class might raise.

4. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are now more descriptive, reflecting the specific scenario being tested.

5. **MODE Tests:** Added tests for `MODE`. This ensures `MODE` is correctly defined and has the expected value.

6. **Complete Example:**  The example now demonstrates how to write tests for a hypothetical `Graber` class and also demonstrates how to test `MODE`.   


**Before running the tests:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder assertions and the example data with the actual expected results based on the `Graber` class's behavior.
- **Import the `Graber` class:**  Ensure that the `from hypotez.src.suppliers.morlevi import Graber` line is at the top of your test file.
- **Correct Imports:** Ensure that all required modules are properly imported.


**Example of how to run pytest:**

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your test file (e.g., `test_morlevi.py`), and run:

```bash
pytest test_morlevi.py
```


Remember to replace the placeholder assertions and data with your actual needs!  Crucially, you *must* understand how your `Graber` class is designed to provide specific data, exceptions and what conditions are expected to return what values.  Properly reflecting those expectations is what makes your tests useful.
