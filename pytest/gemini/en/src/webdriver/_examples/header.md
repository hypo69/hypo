**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** A `dir_root_fixture` is introduced to provide the root directory path. This isolates the test from the specifics of the current working directory.

2. **`test_dir_root_calculation`:** This test now validates that the returned `dir_root` is a `Path` object and checks if the directory actually exists (critical).  This is essential for realistic testing.

3. **`test_sys_path_appending` and `test_sys_path_append_src`:** These tests are significantly improved. Instead of directly asserting changes in `sys.path`, they now append and remove the paths. This prevents side effects on subsequent tests.  Crucially, the added paths are removed to ensure no unexpected changes to the global state.

4. **`test_dir_src_creation`:**  This test is crucial. It checks that the `dir_src` path is constructed correctly, which is good practice to validate component correctness, and verifies that it exists.

5. **`test_exception_for_nonexistent_hypotez`:** This is a vital edge-case test.  It now uses a `try...except` block to correctly assert that a `ValueError` is raised when `hypotez` is not found. This prevents the test from crashing due to a nonexistent path, which is critical for robust code.



**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the provided code, handling valid and invalid inputs and edge cases, making it more reliable and robust. Remember that the test involving `sys.path` modification needs to carefully manage the path and remove it to avoid affecting other tests or the program's state.  Adding a test for a missing `hypotez` directory is also important to demonstrate robustness.
