```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **No Testable Code:** The provided code only defines variables (`MODE`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`).  No functions or methods are present, which are necessary for testing.  The placeholder tests are minimal and only verify the types and basic structure of the attributes.

2. **Specific Tests for Version:**  Crucially, tests are added to check the `__version__` attribute. This is a crucial part of a Python package, as it should validate the format of the version string and the type of the returned object.

3. **Type Checking:** The tests check that `__version__` is actually a `Version` object from the `packaging` library, ensuring it's properly parsed.  This is vital for robust version handling in packages.

4. **Format Verification:** It now validates that the version string conforms to a basic format (X.Y.Z), ensuring it's properly formatted.

5. **Docstring Check:** The test verifies that `__doc__` is indeed a string, which is the expected type for docstrings.

6. **Details Check:** The test ensures that `__details__` is a dictionary, checking its data type, which is essential for any details about the package.

**How to use these tests:**

1.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_examples.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py` file.
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_examples.py`

**Crucial Next Steps:**

To create meaningful tests, you **must** provide the Python code containing functions, methods, or classes that need to be tested.  These tests are designed to handle testing version information (which is useful and important), but real testing will focus on functionality when provided.
