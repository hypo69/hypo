**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock WebDriver:** The code now uses a `MockWebDriver` class to simulate a WebDriver. This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the `DriverBase` class from the external dependencies of `selenium`.  This prevents flakiness in tests from external factors like internet connectivity or browser processes.


2. **`@pytest.fixture`:**  A `mock_driver` fixture is defined to create a new `MockWebDriver` instance for each test.  This ensures test isolation and clean-up.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names (e.g., `test_get_url_valid`) are more descriptive and follow a consistent pattern.

4. **Test Cases (Expanded):**  The example includes basic tests for `get_url`, `extract_domain`, `scroll`, `locale`, showing how to test various scenarios.  Critically, we now have tests for invalid/exceptional cases.

5. **Error Handling:**  The `pytest.raises` context manager is used correctly to test exceptions.

6. **Example for value-returning methods:**  Shows how to test methods that return values (e.g., `locale`), also including tests for invalid cases (e.g. a page source that doesn't have language information).

7. **Robustness:** The tests now include examples of how to handle different input types (valid URLs, empty strings, and even None).  This provides a more comprehensive and reliable set of tests.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save:** Save the above code as `test_driverbase.py`.  Make sure your `DriverBase` class is in a file named `webdriver.py`.

3.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_driverbase.py
    ```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Complete Testing:** This is a starting point. You need to add more tests for the remaining methods (`_save_cookies_localy`, `page_refresh`, `window_focus`, etc.) and incorporate more edge cases (e.g., various URL formats, invalid input for `scroll` parameters).
* **Mock More:** Ideally, mock any part of the code that relies on external resources (e.g., filesystems) to make tests faster and more stable.
* **Selenium Interactions (for a real WebDriver):** If you need to interact with a real browser (not just a mock), you'll need to set up a browser driver (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and properly use `pytest.mark.skipif` to skip test if Selenium is not available.   Be mindful of timeouts for element locators.  Avoid `WebDriverWait` on mock implementations.
* **Error Messages:**  Ensure your custom exceptions in `webdriver` have informative error messages for debugging.

Remember to adapt the tests to match the expected behavior of your actual `DriverBase` class and methods.  Using mocks to isolate tests is essential for reliable, repeatable test results.
