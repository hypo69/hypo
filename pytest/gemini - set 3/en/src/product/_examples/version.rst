```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, like `test_version_value`, `test_mode_value`.

2. **Type Checking:** The tests now verify the expected types of `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, and `__name__`, ensuring they are strings (or dicts for `__annotations__`). This is crucial for robustness.

3. **Edge Case (Running Directly):** The `test_name_main_running` function now *attempts* to verify that `__name__` is `"__main__"`. However, *crucially*, it now incorporates a `try...except` block.  This is essential as we *cannot reliably determine if a Python file is run directly using the current pytest setup* in a testing framework.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover the string nature of the variables, the expected string values (like `MODE = 'dev'`, `__version__`), and the type of __annotations__ as a dict.

5. **Missing Data Handling:**  The example code contained no code that *requires* data inputs. If your module had functions with parameters, additional tests for various types of input and expected outputs would be needed to be properly covered.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`

**Important Considerations:**

- **Real-World Module Testing:**  For production-level modules, especially those that interact with external systems or have significant logic, the tests would be much more complex.  You'd need to mock or stub dependencies (if needed), and properly test error handling.


This revised solution addresses the prompt's requirements more comprehensively and robustly, especially the edge case of how Python files can be executed. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual functions and classes within your `version.py` file.
