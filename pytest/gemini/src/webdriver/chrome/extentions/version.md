```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `re`:** The code now imports the `re` module, which is essential for validating the format of the `__version__` string.

2. **`test_version_string`:** This test checks that `__version__` is a string, using `isinstance()`.

3. **`test_version_value`:** This test checks if the `__version__` string matches the expected format (a string in the format X.X.X.X.X.X) using a regular expression (`re.match()`).  This is *crucial* for ensuring the data conforms to your needs.  Adapt the regular expression if necessary.

4. **`test_invalid_version_format`:**  This demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.  The code now sets up an example scenario (here by assigning a non-matching version) and verifies that the correct `ValueError` is raised, containing a clear description.   This is a placeholder; you must replace this section with code that generates an invalid version and asserts that the proper exception is raised when the code is run with this invalid version.

5. **`test_version_not_none`:** This added test ensures the crucial condition that `__version__` is not None.  This is very important for defensive programming, especially for versions.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`

**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **More Comprehensive Tests:** If your `__version__` code has more functionalities (e.g., validation logic), you need to add more tests to cover those aspects.   The code supplied in the original version is highly limited and makes assumptions. More detailed testing is required based on the actual functions.

* **Example Usage:** Replace the placeholder in `test_invalid_version_format` with actual code that generates an invalid version and verifies the expected exception.

* **Data-Driven Tests:** If the version calculation involves dynamic data, consider using parameterized tests (with `pytest.mark.parametrize`) to efficiently test various inputs.


This improved solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive testing approach for your `__version__` variable. Remember to adapt the tests to reflect the actual logic and error handling of your `version.py` file. Remember to adapt the tests to reflect the actual logic and error handling of your `version.py` file. This is an important part of software development practice. Remember to tailor the regular expression used in `test_version_value` to the actual expected format of your version strings.
