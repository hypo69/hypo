        except Exception as e:
            logger.error('Error processing traffic signals:', e)

# Example usage (replace with your config file path)
# config_file = 'traffic_config.json'
# tl = TrafficLight(config_file)
# tl.process_traffic()
```

## Changes Made

- Added `import json` for `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` to handle JSON loading.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` for logging.
- Added `TrafficLight` class with initialization and `process_traffic` method.
- Added RST-style docstrings to the class and methods.
- Replaced placeholder comments with more specific RST-style comments.
- Implemented basic error handling using `try-except` and `logger.error`.
- Added detailed error messages to logging.
- Added placeholders for TODO items for validation and traffic logic.
- Removed unnecessary comments and docstrings.
- Ensured that the function adheres to Python's naming conventions.
