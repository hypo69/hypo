**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Critically important for testing internal functions like `_load_settings` and `_set_launch_options` without relying on external files or the network.  This prevents flaky tests due to file changes or external dependencies.
* **Exception Handling:** The `test_playwrid_start_with_exception` test now correctly demonstrates exception handling within the `start` method, verifying the `logger` is used as intended.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific, ensuring the correct values are set for `browser.playwright_launch_options`.
* **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests now cover valid input (with and without custom settings), and a crucial edge case: handling exceptions during the `super().run()` call.  This is essential for robustness.
* **pytest Fixtures:** Uses `@pytest.fixture` properly.
* **Realistic Data:** Mock settings data for testing custom settings logic.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Replace `crawlee.playwright_crawler` and `src.utils`, `src.logger` with the correct path in your project, if necessary.
3.  Save the above test code in a Python file (e.g., `test_playwrid.py`).
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_playwrid.py`


This revised solution is significantly more robust and complete, addressing potential issues and covering more scenarios for better test coverage.  Remember to adapt the paths to your specific project structure if needed. Remember to install necessary libraries if they aren't already present:


```bash
pip install pytest
```
