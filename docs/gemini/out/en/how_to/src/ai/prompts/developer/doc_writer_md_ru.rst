How to document code in `hypotez` project
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This document outlines the guidelines for generating code documentation for the `hypotez` project.  It covers creating documentation for modules, classes, functions/methods, and handling exceptions, ensuring consistency and clarity.  All documentation should follow ReStructuredText (RST) format.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Analyze the code:**  Carefully review the code block, understanding its logic, actions, and intended purpose.


2. **Structure the documentation:**

    *   **Modules:**  Start with a module description explaining its overall function and role. Include examples of its use, formatted as fenced code blocks (language: python). Specify the platforms on which the module is intended to function and a concise overview of its purpose.
    *   **Classes:** Detail the class's purpose. Describe its attributes and methods in separate sections.  For each method, clearly define its parameters, return values, and provide example usage (in fenced code blocks).
    *   **Functions/Methods:**  Describe the parameters and return values of each function.  Explain what the function/method does and give example usage (using fenced code blocks).
    *   **Exceptions:** Document potential exceptions that might occur within the code and their circumstances. This includes parameter descriptions for exceptions and illuStartive code examples.


3. **Formatting:** Adhere to the provided RST format (as seen in the prompt examples).  Use appropriate headings (e.g., `# Модуль: ...`, `## Атрибуты`, `### Метод: ...`) for clarity.


4. **Specific details and examples:**

    *   Avoid vague terms like "getting" or "doing." Use precise verbs (e.g., "checks," "validates," "processes").
    *   In examples, include the relevant imports and necessary setup.
    *   Use concrete, reproducible examples that showcase typical usage and potential error handling.


5. **Comments:** Comments within the code should be formatted as Markdown, explaining specific code segments or sections.  Comments should be comprehensive, avoiding overly brief descriptions.


6. **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in the documentation style and formatting across the entire project.


Usage example
-------------------------
The provided examples in the prompt show the expected format for documenting modules, classes, methods, and exceptions.  For every code block to be documented, follow these principles.
