```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `build` function and the `_create_credentials` method. This is essential because the Google Drive API calls require actual credentials and a connection, which cannot be easily simulated in a unit test.  The tests now correctly mock these dependencies without making external calls.

2. **`@pytest.fixture`:**  Fixtures are used to create and manage the mock objects (credentials, service). This improves organization and makes tests more readable.

3. **Dummy Credentials:** A `mock_credentials` fixture now creates a *dummy* `Credentials` object. This is a better alternative to simply asserting `creds is not None`, as it provides concrete values to test against.


4. **`test_upload_file`:** The `test_upload_file` test is significantly improved, mocking the crucial `build` method. Note the important comment about the lacking implementation of actual file upload and the assertion now ensuring no errors occur.


5. **`test__create_credentials`:** A test is added for the internal method, mocking the required dependencies.

6. **`test_main`:**  The test for `main` now only asserts that `main` runs without error.  It's important to adapt this if the `main` function does more than just these calls to external drive methods.

**Before running these tests:**

*   **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```
*   **Create a dummy `secrets.json` file:**  Replace the placeholder with your actual credentials.  A real test would need a valid Google service account key to function, since it needs to interact with the Drive API.

**Important Considerations (for a truly functional test):**

*   **Real Credentials:** The best practice for testing functions that interact with the Google Drive API involves using a dedicated Google Cloud project with service account credentials. Mock objects only help with functions in your code and don't simulate external API calls.
*   **Error Handling:** The tests should include tests for cases where the service account credentials are invalid or the requested file is not found. These cases need careful mocking.


This improved version provides a solid foundation for testing your Google Drive code with pytest and mocks. Remember to adjust and expand on these tests to cover more scenarios and edge cases in your actual implementation. Replace the dummy file in `test_upload_file` with your actual test file.
