**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the purpose (e.g., `test_version_valid`, `test_author_valid`).

2. **Type Checking:** Added tests to verify the expected types of `__version__`, `__author__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`.  This is crucial for ensuring the code behaves as expected.  Added handling for the potential absence of annotations.

3. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed):**  Since the code didn't contain any explicit error-raising functions, `pytest.raises` isn't used. The tests now focus on checking the data itself.

4. **`MODE` Variable Test:** A test for the `MODE` variable is added to validate its value, though `MODE` is a simple string.

5. **Error Handling (Import):** The tests are robust by using `from ... import ...` to directly import the elements. If the file is not found, pytest will report an appropriate error, preventing the test suite from continuing if there are problems.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover the core data elements: `__version__`, `__author__`, and the types of these elements, which is the likely goal.  The documentation-related parts are left out.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/version.py`.
2.  Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.  Pytest will execute the tests and report the results.


**Important Considerations:**

*   **File Structure:** The tests are written assuming the file `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/version.py` exists in the correct location and contains the Python code you provided.
*   **Context:** The tests are targeted at the specific data (variables) in the Python file and don't try to test functionality (logic) within the file.   If the file structure changes, the `from` statements will need to be adjusted.
