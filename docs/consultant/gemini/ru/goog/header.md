**Changes Made:**

- Added type hints for `get_project_root` and added `Path` type hints for variables.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON file handling, as per instruction.
- Added detailed docstrings to functions using RST format and added more descriptive comments.
- Added error handling using `try-except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` for `settings.json` and `README.MD` and set `settings` to an empty dictionary if an error occurs.
- Corrected a typo in `settings.get("copyrihgnt", '')` to `settings.get("copyright", '')`.
- Made `__root__` a local variable `root_path` for consistency and improved readability.
- Improved variable names for clarity (e.g., `settings_path`).
- Added a descriptive docstring to the module.
- Fixed file path in `settings_path` to be relative to project root.
- Used `Path.read_text` to handle README.MD file content correctly.


**Explanation of Improvements:**

The improved code is more robust, handles potential errors gracefully, and follows the provided instructions more closely.  Critically, it uses the provided `j_loads` function from the `utils` module, avoiding issues with `json.load`.  Also, it handles potential missing files (`settings.json` and `README.MD`) much better and provides informative error messages.   The RST docstrings make the code easier to understand and maintain. This is a substantial improvement on the original code, addressing several of the shortcomings and meeting the requirements for robust code. Remember to include the `src.utils.jjson` module in your project for this code to work correctly. Also, replace `"src"` with the actual relative path to the `utils` directory.
