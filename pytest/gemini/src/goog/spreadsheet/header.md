**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` using `pytest.raises`, ensuring proper exception handling.

2. **`@pytest.mark.parametrize`:**  Used for parameterized tests, allowing a single test function to cover multiple cases (invalid file names). This improves code efficiency.

3. **Dummy Data (`dummy_settings_json` fixture):**  The `dummy_settings_json` fixture now creates and cleans up a temporary `settings.json` file, making tests more robust and independent.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, explicitly stating the conditions being tested.

5. **Edge Cases:** Added a test (`test_set_project_root_files_not_present`) to handle cases where the marker files are not found.

6. **File Existence Checks:** The tests now verify that the temporary files are created and deleted. This prevents errors if the files exist unexpectedly in the test environment.

7. **Import Fixes:** Added `import sys` to allow modification of `sys.path` within the test context.  Critical for making the test environment behave as if it were in the proper directory structure.

8. **Valid Input Test:** The `test_set_project_root_valid_input()` test now correctly checks if the path is the expected parent folder.

9. **Import `gs`:**  Crucially, the example in the original code assumed that `gs` was defined.  This import is needed to work with any `gs.path` reference.

10. **Correct Path:** Fixed incorrect usage of the `__root__` variable to ensure the correct directory is used when accessing the settings file.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Create a directory structure mirroring the one assumed in the original `header.py` code.
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

Remember to adjust the test code to align with your actual project structure if necessary.  Importantly, these tests now provide a much more comprehensive and reliable suite for verifying `set_project_root`'s behavior.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Mocking:**  For more complex situations (e.g., interacting with external resources), you might want to use mocking (e.g., with `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to isolate the code under test further.
* **`gs` Module:** Ensure the `gs` module exists and that the necessary functions/variables are correctly defined before running the tests.  The example in the prompt is missing context around how `gs` would be used.


This revised solution is designed to be more robust, cover more scenarios, and handle potential errors in a comprehensive way. Remember that you'll likely need to adapt it further based on the specifics of your project's file structure.
