**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the scenario, making them more readable.

2. **Temporary Directories:**  Crucially, temporary directories are created for testing. This prevents conflicts with existing project structures and ensures that tests run independently.  The code now correctly removes the temporary directories after each test.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The test cases now cover situations with marker files present at different levels (the current directory, a parent directory), no marker files, and where marker files cannot be found.


4. **Robustness:** The tests are designed to be more robust by addressing possible issues with incorrect input or missing files.

5. **Example for Exception Handling (crucial):** The original code had `try...except` blocks for potential errors.  You *must* test those exception cases.  I added a placeholder comment about how to add this.


**How to run these tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Ensure that the `hypotez` directory structure exists (if it doesn't, create it, and place your `src` and `gui` folder with a `header.py` file).
3. Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
4. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved suite will provide more confidence in the correctness and robustness of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` to your actual expected input. Remember to adapt the example for exception handling to the specific exception types you might encounter in your `try...except` blocks.
