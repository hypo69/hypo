**Changes Made**

- Added a docstring to the module using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Added a function `get_version()` to encapsulate the version retrieval. This function now returns the version string.
- Added a type hint (`-> str`) to the `get_version()` function to improve code clarity.
- Replaced the global `__version__` variable with a call to `get_version()`.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Moved the module docstring to the top of the file and formatted it as an RST string.
- Improved the structure to be more Pythonic and maintainable.
- Removed the unnecessary shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python`).  These are usually handled by the build system.
- Added a missing `import` statement for the `logger`.
