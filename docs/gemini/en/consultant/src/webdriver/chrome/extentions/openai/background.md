# Received Code

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');
});
```

# Improved Code

```javascript
"""
Background script for the OpenAI Model Interface extension.

This script handles initialization events, such as extension installation.
"""
import logging

# Import the logger from src.logger.
from src.logger import logger


def on_installation():
    """
    Handles extension installation events.

    Logs a message indicating that the extension has been installed.
    """
    logger.info('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed')


chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(on_installation)
```

# Changes Made

- Added RST-format documentation to the script, including a module description and function documentation.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error handling.
- Replaced `console.log` with `logger.info` for better logging.
- Added missing `import logging` statement.
- Created a dedicated `on_installation` function to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Changed the log message from a string literal to a call to the logging function for better integration with the logging system.
