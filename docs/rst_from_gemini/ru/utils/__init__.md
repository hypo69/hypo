**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling (Crucial):** The code now includes a `try...except` block around `get_project_root()`. This is absolutely essential. If the marker files aren't found, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, preventing your script from crashing and providing a useful error message. Importantly, it now provides a fallback to the current directory (`Path.cwd()`) if the marker files are not found, which might be appropriate for development or if you want a specific default behavior.

2. **Path Existence Check:**  Before adding a directory to `sys.path`, it verifies if the directory actually exists using `bin_path.exists()`. This prevents errors from trying to import from non-existent paths.


3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Slightly improved variable names (e.g., `current_path` instead of `__current_path__`) for better readability.

4. **Docstring Improvement:** Added `Raises` section in the docstring of `get_project_root()` to properly document the error.

5. **Explicit Fallback:**  The code now explicitly sets a fallback value for `__root__` if the marker files aren't found, preventing the script from failing and providing a default behavior.

6. **Removed Redundant `MODE` Variables:** The `MODE = 'debug'` lines were redundant and removed.

These changes make the code more robust, maintainable, and less prone to unexpected errors.  Thorough error handling is critical in any production-level code. Remember to adjust the fallback behavior (e.g., the default root) according to your specific project's needs.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Project Structure:**  Your project structure (e.g., `bin` directories, marker files) significantly impacts how this code works. Double-check that your expected files are actually present in the project.
* **`sys.path` Management:**  Be cautious about how you manage `sys.path` in larger projects.  There are strategies for more complex and robust import handling.  This improved code example is suitable for smaller modules where these basic precautions suffice.
* **Import Statements:**  Your import statements (e.g., `from .convertors import ...`) should be properly organized to correctly import and use those functions.


By addressing these issues, the code will be more reliable and less prone to failure.  Testing with various project structures and conditions is crucial. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` and the fallback to your project specifics.
