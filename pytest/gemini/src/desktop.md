```python
import pytest

# No Python code is present in the input, so no tests can be written.
# The input is a .ini file, not Python code.  Returning empty tests.

# Example of how to handle if there was Python code:
#
# def test_empty_file_exception():
#     with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
#         # ... code that should raise a FileNotFoundError ...
#
# def test_valid_file_content():
#     # ... code to assert correctness based on the file content ...
