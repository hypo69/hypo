Preface
Mots eis not the first collection of computer games and. simula— tions nor will it by any means be the last. However, in many Weyer it 1S unigue. It is the first collection of games all mernciC, lt 1s also the only collection that.contains both
a complete listing and a sample run of each game along with a descriptive write-up.
Educational Value of Games
Educators have widely different opinions as to the educational value of games. There tends to be agreement that games are highly motivational and frequently very addictive. Most educators agree that games generally foster learning by dis- covery--1.e., the player doesn't sit down at the terminal with the purpose of learning a-principle of togic but after playing BAGLES three or four times he most assuredly has learned some- thing about logic. Newton's second law is probably the furthest thing from the mind of a person sitting down to play ROCKET. However, when the player finally lands his LEM successfully on the moon, the chances are very good that he has discovered something about gravity varying inversely with the mass of the LEM and the distance from the moon.
The main objection to games as a learning tool seems to be the fact that it's largely unguided learning and potentially waste- ful of computer time. Art Leuhrmann of Dartmouth joked that
some computer center directors might be willing to pay to not have the book sold on campus because of the computer time that would be burned up by playing the games; however, the educational value of games can be enormous - not only in their playing but
in their creation,
The majority of games submitted tend to simulate a sport, card
or board game, a game of chance or something which already exists. Only a few games begin to use the logical and computational Capabilities of the computer to come up with something new and Geuly unique. Some that do are STARES, BULCOW, ROCKET, and
Certain games are, of course, more popular with game authors that others. There were no less than ten versions of NIM submitted, nine versions each of HORSES (Horse Race) and TICTAC (Tic-Tac-Toe), and eight versions of CRAPS. Other popular ones were simulations of baseball, basketball, football, blackjack, and hangman.
Families of Games
A word about the title of the book. The astute, quantitatively-
ofLented reader might notice that “there seem to be more coan
101 games in the book. In fact, there are 108 individual games;
(-are-different verSrons of another -game.. There are 101. ceparate write-ups; thus, the title of the book.
Perhaps it is a disease of using the computer or perhaps it is just a compulsion of man that he must categorize things. fThe games in this book could be categorized by level of GLEE Led dey, as is often the case in collections of puzzles. They could also be categorized in an educational sense, for example, those that could be used to teach logic principles, those that foster learing by discovery, those that require the “user -to- solve—an algebra problem, etc.
In the first two groups, Number or Letter Guessing and Piles of Objects, you will probably get more enjoyment 12 youcpilay the games in the numbered order as there is a definite sequential MoeUbe CO tneir dittiieulty. In the other fourteen categories, the games may be played in any order; one does not generally build upon another except in a few cases. INsPpantlcular,../OU should play:
BAGLES before BULCOW HI-Q before 1CHECK BATTLE before SALVO GUNNER before SUNERL ROCKET before ROCKT2 HMRABI before KING
Equipment to Play, Computer and Otherwise
Most of the games in this book require no special knowledge, tools Or equipment to play, except, .Otccourse, a BASIC-speaking computer. Hour of the matrix games will probably be more enjoyable if you use a grid or quadrille paper to Play. Unless you have a photo- graphic memory, QUBIC almost certainly requires a diagram. There is a page included as Appendix B which contains some supplemental diagrams; you may wish to reproduce it if you become addicted to the games on it.
With few exceptions, the games all run in "standard" BASTC. Any exceptions are noted in the write-ups under the heading, "Computer Limitations." The major difference between various computer systems appears to be in the handling of alphabetic strings. On Digital systems a subscripted string variable, for example, AS(8) or en SM Gh Rey's refers to a variable in an array or matrix. Other BASIC compilers may not have string arrays.
On some systems, in particular, Digital's Edusystems 20, 25, and 50, strings are limited to 6 characters. Several strings may, or course,
be combined in an array to permit longer than 6-letter words to be used.
Many programs use the RANDOMIZE command to start the random number generator at a random point. Some BASIC compilers do not recognize RANDOMIZE and it must be removed in order for the program to run.
Digital BASIC permits more than one statement on each program line.
Statement separators on the line may be one of three characters -- Z-Or = .Or O A

Description
This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game. In the game, the dealer (the computer) deals two cards face up.
You have an option to bet or not to bet depending on whether or not you feel the next card dealt will have a value between the first. two.
Your initial money (Q) is set to $100; you may alter Statement 170 if you want to start with more or less than $100. The
game keeps going on until you lose all your money or interrupt the program.

DRAW A MAZE
This program will print out a different maze every time it is run and guarantees only one path through. You can choose
the dimensions of the maze--i.e. the number of squares wide and long.
Computer Limitations
The amount of memory available will determine the maximum size maze that may be constructed. An 8K EduSystem 20 initialized £o0r one user can draw a 13x13 maze. *RSTS/E
can draw a 23 (width of paper limit) x 50 maze, even larger uSing virtual memory.
Experiment on your system with the maze dimensions in Statement 110.

ANI MAL COMPUTER GUESSES YOUR ANIMAL
Description
Unlike other computer games in which the computer picks a number or letter and you must guess what it is, in this game you think of an animal and the computer asks you questions and tries to guess the name of your animal. If the computer, guesses incorrectly, it will ask you for a question that differentiates the animal it guessed from the One you were thinking of. In this way the computer "learns" new animals. Questions to differentiate new animals should be input without a question mark.
IMPORTANT: At the end of a playing session, to the question, "ARE YOU THINKING OF AN ANIMAL," you must respond "SAVE"
in order that the computer save all the new animals you have introduced. To that same question, at any point in the game, if you respond "LIST," the computer will tell you all the animals it knows so far.
The program starts originally by knowing only "FISH" and "BIRD." Additional animals are stored in the file "ANIMAL.GME,."
Computer Limitations
This program was written for a DIGITAL RSTS-1l1 and uses several unique features, in particular, multiple user access to a common data file and several advanced string handling functions. It has been converted with some minor changes to OS/8 BASIC
and could be adapted to other systems as well.

Description
REMOVE BEANS FROM THE PITS
My SIDE
My vour HOME HOME
Your SIDE
AWARI game is played with seven sticks and thirty-six stones (beans) laid out as shown above. The board is divided into six compartments (PITS) on ‘my SIDE* and six-on ‘your SIDE! .95in addition, there are two special PITS at the ends: 'my HOME'
and ‘your HOME'.
A MOVE is made by taking all of the beans from any (non-empty) PIT on your own SIDE. Starting from the PIT to the’ right of this one, these beans are 'SOWN' one in each PIT working around the board anticlockwise.
A TURN consists of one or two MOVES. If the last bean of your MOVE is SOWN in your own HOME you may take a second MOVE.
If the last bean SOWN in a MOVE lands in an empty PIT, provided that the opposite PIT is not empty, all the beans in the opposite PIT, together with the last bean SOWN are ‘'captured' and moved
to the player's HOME.
When either side is empty, the game is finished. The player with most beans in his HOME has won.
Lo
In the computer version, the board is printed as 14 numbers representing the 14 PITS.
The PITS on your (lower) SIDE are numbered 1-6 from left to right. The PITS on my (the computer's) SIDE are numbered from
Myelete a(yOure Clon).
To make a MOVE you type in the number of a PIT. If the last bean lands in your HOME, the computer types 'AGAIN?' and you then type in your second move.
The computer's MOVE is typed, followed by a diagram of the board in its new state. The computer always offers you the first move. This is considered to be a slight advantage.
There is a learning mechanism in the program that causes the play of the computer to improve as it plays more games.
Computer Limitations
This program is written in DIGITAL PDP-11 BASIC. The only unusual feature is that an IF statement may have the form:
IF (CONDITION) THEN (STATEMENT)
Whenever the IF condition fails, the program branches to the next line.

BAGTLES _..........
Description
The computer picks a 3-digit secret number and you attempt to guess what it is. You are allowed up to twenty guesses. No digit is repeated. After each guess the computer will give you clues about your guess as follows:
PECO One digit is correct, but in the wrong place FERMI One digit is in the correct place BAGLES No “digit is correct
You will learn to draw inferences from the clues and, with practice, you'll learn to improve your score. There are Several good strategies for playing BAGLES. After you have found a good strategy, see if you can improve it. Or try
a different strategy altogether and see if it is any better.
This program was submitted from several sources including Dartmouth and U.C.-Berkeley. The one published here is EEOmsU.C's

BANNER un...
Description
This program creates a large banner on a terminal of any message you input (up to 54 characters in length). The
letters may be any dimension you wish although the letter height plus distance from left-hand side should not exceed
6 inches. Also, the letter height should be somewhat more
than the width. Adhering to these rules will generally produce a very attractive banner.
Computer Limitations
BANNER was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50. For other computers, the character string line input (LINPUT) statement at Line 240 would have to be changed.

BASEBALL GAME
BASEBL
Description
This is a simulation of a nine-inning baseball game with you controlling the pitcher when your team has the field and controlling the batter when you are up to bat. The simulation stops at nine innings, hence, it may be a tie game; however, that has proved to occur remarkably few times.
Computer Limitations
The game published was written for DIGITAL EduSystem 15730735 and actually consists of two programs, one which prints the rules chained to the second program which plays the game. "NOLINE" must be given before running to prevent overflow. Other BASIC compilers will require conversion of the alphabetic string input statements to a compatible format.
source
Another version of baseball was submitted for Timeshared-8
by Jeff Moskow and Brad Golden. of Lexington High School.
This is available from DECUS as BASIC 8-562. A second version was submitted by another Lexington High School student, Les Servie. A FORTRAN version was submitted by David Benepe of Fort Worth, Texas. These versions are not printed herein.

BA “ee K ET BASKETBALL GAME VS DARTMOUTH
Description
This program simulates a game of basketball between Dartmouth College and an opponent of your choice. You are the Dartmouth captain and control the type of shot and defense during the course of the game.
There are four types of shots: 1. Long Jump Shot (30 ft.),
Co SnOLceWIAmDgonOtwy (Lose .) > S.-- Lay Up,~and 4. Set, Shot.
Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it: Press (6), Man-to-man (6.5), Zone (7), or None (7.5). To change defense, cype 0” as oun next. shot.
Note: The game is biased slightly in favor of Dartmouth. The average probability of a Dartmouth shot being good is 62.95% compared to a probability of 61.85% for their opponent.
(This makes the sample run somewhat remarkable in that Cornell won by a score of 51 to 35. Hooray for the Big Red:)

BATNUM. ...........
Description
The game starts with an imaginary pile of objects, coins for example. You and your opponent (the computer) alternately remove objects from the pile. You specify in advance the minimum and maximum number of objects that can be taken on each turn. You also specify in advance how winning is defined: 1. To take the last object or 2. To avoid taking the last object. You may also determine whether you or the computer go first.
The strategy of this game is based on modulo arithmetic. If the maximum number of objects a player may remove in a turn is M, then to gain a winning position a player at the end of his turn must leave a stack of 1 modulo (Mtl) .coins. “Ft =roa don't understand this, play 23 Matches (23 MTCH) first, then BATNUM, and just have fun!
Program Author
BATNUM is based on an old game similar to NIM. Its adaptation for the computer appears to originally be by the daddy of BASIC:

NAVAL SHIP BATTLE
"BATTLE is based on the popular game Battleship which is primarily played to familiarize people with the location and designation of points on a coordinate plane."
BATTLE first randomly sets up the bad guys' fleet disposition on a 6 by 6 matrix or grid. The fleet consists of Six ships: Two destroyers (ships number 1 and 2) which are two units long; two cruisers (ships number 3 and 4) which are three units long and two aircraft carriers (ships number 5 and 6) which are
four units long. The program then prints out this fleet dis- position in a coded or disguised format (see the sample com- puter print-out). You then proceed to sink the various ships by typing in the coordinates (two digits, each from 1 te 6G, Separated by a comma) of the place where you want to drop a bomb, if you'll excuse the expression. The computer gives
the appropriate responses (splash, hit, etc.) which you should record on a 6 by 6 matrix. You are thus building a representa- tion of the actual fleet disposition which you will hopefully use to decode the coded fleet disposition printed out by the computer. Each time a ship is sunk, the computer prints out which ships have been sunk so far and also gives you a "SPLASH/HIT RATIO".
ihe first thing you should learn is how to locate and designate positions on the matrix, and Specifically the difference between "3,4" and "4,3". Our method corresponds to the location of points on the coordinate plane rather than the location of numbers in a standard algebraic matrix: The first number gives the column counting from left to‘right and the second number gives the row counting from bottom to top.
The second thing you should learn about is the splash/hit ratio. Wat iS atratdo2! A good reply is "It's a fraction or quotients | Specifically, the splash/hit ratio is the number of splashes divided by the number of hits. If€ you had 9 splashes and 15
hits, the ratio would be 9/15 or 3/5, both of Which are correct. The computer would give this splash/hit ratio as 6.2
One of the main objects and primary educational benefits of BATTLE comes from attempting to decode the bad guys' fleet disposition code. To do this, you must make a COMPARISON between the coded matrix and the actual matrix which you con- struct as you play the game.

Description
In this game you and the computer play a game of bingo. The computer first generates a bingo card for both you and itself. It then spins the number drum and draws numbers at random which it posts on "the board." It's up to you to play both your card and the card of the computer (a second person can play this card if you wish).
The computer checks for BINGO on both cards, so don't try to cheat:

BLKJAK _........
Description
This is a simulation of the game of blackjack or 21, Las Vegas style. This is one of the more comprehensive versions of black- jack which allows splitting your hand if the first two cards
are the same. Also, the dealer will ask for an insurance bet
if he has an exposed ace. The house limit is $500.00.
Source
A number of versions of this program were submitted. Ira Gold- stein of Fort Worth, Texas, submitted a particularly interesting version which uses a second chained program (DECK) to shuffle the cards. Two versions are printed here -- one written and modified by a number of DIGITAL personnel for RSTS-11 and another written by students at the Oregon Museum of Science
and Industry and slightly modified at DIGITAL.

BOAT SUBMARINE VS GUNBOAT
Description
You are captain of a submarine and the computer is captain of a gunboat. The speed of the gunboat is given at the beginning of the game. You fire torpedos at the gunboat. To sink it, you must hit it twice in at least two vulnerable places, or once in a vulnerable place and twice in any other part of the hull. But, if you ever miss, the gunboat will open fire on you. If this happens, you alternatively fire at each other until you sink the gunboat or until he sinks you.

To the best of our knowledge, we think BOAT was originally written by a student at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA.

BOM BER FLY A WORLD WAR II BOMBER
Description
In this program, you fly a World War II bomber for one of the four protagonists of the war. You then pick your target or the type of plane you are flying. Depending upon your flying ex- perience and the quality of the enemy defenders, you then may accomplish your mission, get shot down, or make it back through enemy fire. In any case, you get a chance to fly again.

BOUNCE PLOT OF BOUNCING BALL
Description
This program plots a bouncing ball. Most computer plots run along the paper in the terminal (top to bottom); however, this plot is drawn horizontally on the paper (left to right).
You may specify the initial velocity of the ball and the coefficient of elasticity of the ball (a superball is about 0.85 -- other balls are much less). You also specify the time increment to be used in "strobing" the flight of the ball. In other words, it is as though the ball is thrown up in a darkened room and you flash a light at fixed time intervals and photograph the progress of the ball.

BOXING OLYMPIC BOXING MATCH
Description
This program simulates a three-round Olympic boxing match. The computer coaches one of the boxers and determines his punches and defenses, while you do the same for your boxer. At the start of the match, you may specify your man's best punch and his vulnerability.
There are approximately seven major punches per round, although this may be varied in Statement 185. The best two out of three rounds wins.

DRAW A BUG VS THE COMPUTER
Description
The object of this game is to finish your drawing of a bug before the computer finishes his. You and the computer roll a die alternately with each number standing for a part of
the bug. You must add “the parts in the right order; aim other words, you cannot have a neck until you have a body, you cannot have a head until you have a neck, and so on. After each new part has been added, you have the option of seeing pictures of the two bugs.
if you elect to see all the~pictures, this program has the ability of consuming well over six feet of Teletype paper per run. We can only suggest recycling the paper by using the other side.

BULCO : : BULLS AND COWS GUESSING GAME
Description
In this game, a somewhat advanced version of BAGLES, the idea is that each player (you and the computer) tries to guess a 5-digit number thought up by the opposing player. A BULL is scored for each correct digit in the correct position and a COW for each correct digit but out of position. For example:
Mystery number 51340 Your guess 21734 scores 1 BULL and 2 COWS
In the first sample run, the human player's mystery number was 12345. In the second run, the number was 13579. Notice that on the fourth computer guess, 35719, the human player told the computer 0,5 (i.e., no BULLS and 5 COWS). This was incorrect; it should have been 1,4, but the computer could not know that until two turns later when it realized that the human had given it impossible scores.
By about the fourth or fifth guess, the computer starts taking quite a bit of time to narrow its choices between guesses. Be patient.

Our mystery number was 12345 Computer's score is 1 BULL for the 3 and 2 COWS for the 1 and 2.
Our mystery number was 13579
This clue was incorrect because the 9 is in the right place. Score should have been 1,4,
BULEYE .......
Description In this game, up to 20 players throw darts at a target with 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-point zones. The objective is-to get 200 points.
You have a choice of three methods of throwing:
Throw Description Probable Score 1k Fast overarm Bullseye or complete miss Z, Controlled overarm LOp ec OF -Or SON posners a Underarm Anything
You will find after playing a while that different players will swear by different strategies. However, consider the expected score per throw by always using Throw 3 (program line 220):
Score (S) Probability (P) Dex oe 40 12-00=.95 = 205 2 30 295—.75. = 220 6 20 ~75-.45 = .30 6 10 -45-.05 = .40 4 O s05-—~00' = 205 e) Expected score per throw = 18
Calculate the expected scores for the other throws and you may be surprised:

BULL =
Description
In this simulated bullfight, you are the matador--i.e., the one with the principal role and the one who must kill the bull or be killed (or run from the ring).
On each pass of the bull, you may try: O Veronica (dangerous inside move of the cape) 1 Less dangerous outside move of the cape 2 Ordinary swirl of the cape Or you may try to kill the bull: 4 Over the horns 5 In the chest
The crowd will determine what award you deserve, posthumously if necessary. The braver you are, the better the award you receive. It's nice to stay alive too. The better the job the picadores and toreadores do, the better your chances.
This program was converted to standard BASIC (DIGITAL Timeshared-8) by students at Lexington High School under the direction of Walt Koetke.

Description
This program prints out a calendar for any year. You must specify the starting day of the week of the year in Statement EKO (Sunday (0), Monday (-1), Tuesday (-2), etc.). You can determine this by using the program WEKDAY. You must also make two changes for leap years in Statements 360 and 620. The program listing describes the necessary changes. Running the program produces a nice 12-month calendar.

CAN-AM
Description
CANADIAN-AMERICAN AUTO RACE
CAN-AM is a simulation of a Canadian-American Challenge Cup auto mece. Ihe road Course is fast (speeds up to 200 m.p.h.jJ. It is long (5.3 miles) and complex (8 curves and 8 straights). You are racing the latest Group 7 cars (McLarens, Lolas, etc.).
The instructions provided by the program are self-explanatory. You should really take heed of track hazards--i.e., rain and oil, except, of course, slowing down too much puts you out of con- tention. BEWARE: This game is very challenging and addictive!
Computer Limitations
The program was written for the Honeywell/GE 635 at Dartmouth. The main inconsistency with other computers is that several people may race using multiple terminals; this is generally not possible on smaller machines.
The comments on the listing are extremely comprehensive and
entertaining. We apologize for not having a sample run, but Poe gOt wiped out.

Description
In this program, the computer pretends it is the cashier at
your friendly neighborhood candy store. You tell it the cost
of the item(s) you are buying, the amount of your payment, pues it will automatically (!) determine your correct change. Aren't
machines wonderful?

CHECKR ___......
Description
This program plays checkers. The pieces of the computer are marked with an "X", yours are marked "0". A move is made by Specifying the coordinates of the piece to be moved (X,Y). Home (1,1) is in the bottom left and X specifies distance to the right of home (i.e., column) and Y specifies distance
above home (i.e., row). You then specify where you wish to move to.
Limitations Unfortunately, the computer program is not smart enough to recognize (or permit!) a double or triple jump. If you try
one, it is likely that your piece will disappear altogether.

C H EM ST DILUTE KRYPTOCYANIC ACID
Description
The fictitious chemical, kryptocyanic acid, can only be diluted by the ratio of 7 parts water to 3 parts acid. Any other ratio causes an unstable compound which soon explodes. Given an amount of acid, you must determine how much water to add for Gijutaencsn tfe-vou:re-more than™5% off, you lose one of your nine lives. The program continues to play until you lose all nine lives or until it is interrupted.

CH | EF ARITHMETIC PRACTICE
Description
In the words of the program author, John Graham,
"CHIEF is designed to give people (mostly kids) practice in the four Operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division).
It does this while giving people some fun. And then, if the people are wrong, it shows them how they should have done it.
It is mostly a game, but can be used by teachers to test the kas."

Description
This program is an adaptation of a mathematical game originally presented in Scientific American, Jan., 1973. Up to a 9x9 grid is set up by you with the upper left square a poison square. This grid is the cookie. Players alternately chomp away at the cookie from the lower right. To take a chomp, input a row and column number of one of the squares remaining on the cookie. All of the squares below and to the right of that square, in- cluding that square, disappear.
Any number of people can play -- the computer is only the moderator; it is not a player. Two-person strategies are in- teresting to work out but strategies when three or more people are playing are a real challenge.

Description
This simulation is based on 14 battles in the Civil War. Facts and figures used are based on the actual occurrence. If you follow the same strategy used in the actual battle, the results will be the same--generally, this is a good strategy since the generals in the Civil War were fairly good military strategists. However, you can frequently outperform the Civil War generals, particularly in cases where they did not have good enemy in- telligence and consequently followed a poor course of action. Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history, although
the computer gives you the rudiments.
After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to the actual casualties of the battle, and you are told whether you win or lose the battle.

CRAPS
Description
GAME OF CRAPS (DICE)
One of the more popular computer games, six versions of CRAPS were submitted (although three appear to be virtually the same program). The version published here is based on standard Nevada craps table rules. That is:
EaAgeiior Wl ontthelfirst roll wins
Awe ee, S| OY a2 Onwtne. first wok Joses
3. Any other number rolled becomes your "point." You Continue to rollwar you-get.your point, you win. If you roll a 7, you lose and the dice change hands when this happens.
Your stake is set in Statement 210; this could be changed to an input statement if desired.
Source
An interesting version of CRAPS was submitted by Philip Bieluch of Trinity College which uses a file to keep track of prior winnings and/or losses. A short but complete version was sub- mitted by George Gidzinski of Adlai Stevenson High School, Prairie View, Illinois.
The published version has been circulating around DIGITAL and its users for years. The original author is unknown.

DIGIT 4y COMPUTER TRIES TO OUTGUESS PLAYER
Description
The player writes down a set of 30 numbers (07 2, epee) sat) random prior to playing the game. The computer program, using pattern recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in
the input.
The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time. It always guesses first and then examines the next number to see if it guessed correctly. By pure luck (or chance or probability), the com- puter ought to be right 10 times. It is uncanny how much better it generally does than that!

DOGS a
Description
This is a dog race game similar to those found in penny arcades and amusement parks. The prior racing experience of each dog (wins and losses) has a bearing on the outcome of the race. After this is posted, up to 19 players may bet on a dog. Maximum bet is $500.00 and minimum is $2.00.
Aftereall the bets are in, the odds will be’ posted and the race begins: After each days's racing, the track will close and record the performance of all the dogs in a permanent file which is called the next time the program is run.
Computer Limitations
DOGS was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50 (Timeshared-8) ; Consequently, the file handling soutine-«(Lines 1257.30, 435,55, 975, 985, 1085) may have to be changed for other systems.
Program Author
The author remarks that he is now 15 and started using a PDP-8 at the age of 12. Since then he has compiled 4 notebooks of programs in BASIC, FOCAL, FORTRAN, and ALGOL. Of his 23 BASIC games, 5 are published in this book.

E : EN PICK UP AN EVEN NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Description
This is a game between you and the computer. To play, an odd number of objects (marbles, chips, matches) are placed in a row. You take turns with the computer picking up between one and four objects each turn. The game ends when there are no objects left, and the winner is the one with an even number of objects picked
up.
Two versions of this game are printed herein. While to the player they appear similar, the programming approach is quite different. EVEN, the first version, is deterministic--i.e., the computer plays by fixed, good rules and is impossible to beat if you don't know how to play the game.
The second version, EVEN 1, is much more interesting because the computer starts out only knowing the rules of the game. Using simple techniques of artificial intelligence (cybernetics), the computer gradually learns to play from its mistakes until it plays a very good game. After 20 games, the computer is a challenge to beat. Variation in the human's style of play seems to make the computer learn more quickly. If you plot the learn- ing curve of this program, it closely resembles classical human learning curves from psychological experiments.

Description
GAME OF FOOTBALL
Football is probably the most popular simulated sports game. Some people have elected to play computerized football in preference to watching a bowl game on television.
The simulation uses standard professional football rules ex- cept there are no penalties. The computer takes the pakke ot your opposing team and also the referee. Eight plays can be run on offense and five on defense. The program presents necessary rules as you play.
Source
Two versions of football are presented herein. A third version received from Paul Garmon of Wellesley Jr. High School is not printed.

FURS FUR TRADING EXPEDITION
Description
You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 leaving the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the next year. You have a choice of three forts at which you may trade. The cost of supplies and the amount you receive for your furs will depend upon the fort you choose. You also specify what types of furs that you have to trade.
The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer. source

Description
GO-MOKO is a traditional game of the Orient. It is played by two people on a board of intersecting lines (19 left-to-right lines, 19 top-to-bottom lines, 361 intersections in aid)-« Players take turns. During his turn, a player may cover one intersection with a marker; (one player uses white markers; the other player uses black markers). The object of the game 1saco get. five adjacent markers in a row, horizontally, ver- tically or along either diagonal.
ORIENTAL GAME OF GO-MOKO
Unfortunately, this program does not make the computer a very good player. It does not know when you are about to win or even who has won. But some of its moves may Surprise you.
Computer Limitations
This program is dimensioned (in Statement 120) for a 19x19 board. Depending upon the size of your computer, you may have to scale this down. A 7x7 board is the smallest that can be used for a meaningful game.

GUESS
Description
In Program GUESS, the computer chooses a random integer between O and any limit you set. You must then try to guess the number the computer has chosen using the clues provided by the computer.
GUESS A RANDOM NUMBER
You should be able to guess the number in One less than the number of digits needed to represent the number in binary notation--i.e., in base 2. This Ought to give you a clue as to the optimum search technique.
Computer Limitations
There are no real limitations; however, the listing is from DIGITAL EduSystem 20 BASIC which accepts statements abbreviated to the first three letters.

GUNNER FIRE A FIELD ARTILLERY WEAPON
Description
These two programs allow you tO adjust the fire of a field
artillery weapon to hit a Stationary or moving target. You specify the number of degrees of elevation of your weapon;
45 degrees provides maximum range with values under or over 45 degrees providing less range.
GUNNER is the simpler of the two programs and gives you up to five shots to destroy the enemy before he destroys you. Gun range is fixed at 46,500 yards, burst radius at 100 yards; you must specify elevation within approximately 0.2 degrees to get a heats
GUNER1 is more complex and allows you to specify the speed at which your target is moving (but not direction.) --and vour burst radius. Also, your gun has a different maximum range randomly determined each play.

HANG ae
Description
This is a simulation of the word guessing game, hangman. The computer picks a word, tells you how many letters in the word it has picked and then you guess a letter in the word. If you are right, the computer tells you where that letter belongs; if your letter is wrong, the computer starts to hang you. You get ten guesses before you are completely hanged:
Head
Body
Right and Left Arms
Right and Left Legs
Right and Left Hands Right and Left Feet
In this program, the PRINT statement is abbreviated to "&." You may add words in Data statements following Statement 508; in this case, you must also change the random word selector in Statement 40.
Source
Interesting versions of Hangman were received from Brandy Brylawski, a seventh grader at the Eaglebrook School, Deerfield, Mass., and a sophisticated one from W.K. Bateman at Montpelier Public Schools, Montpelier, Vt.
The one printed is from a high school sophomore: Kenneth Aupperle

HEX
Description
The game of Hexapawn and a method to learn a strategy for play- ing the game was described in "Mathematical Games" in the March 1962 issue of Scientific American. The method described in the article was for a hypothetical learning machine composed of match boxes and colored beads. This has been generalized in the Program HEX.
GAME OF HEXAPAWN
The program learns by elimination of bad moves. All positions encountered by the program and acceptable moves from them are stored in the array P$(I). When the program encounters an un- familiar position, the position and all legal moves fromere
are added to the list. If the program loses a game, it erases the move that led to defeat. If it hits a position from which all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat), it erases the move that got it there and resigns. Eventually, the program learns to play extremely well and, indeed, is unbeatable. The learning strategy could be adopted to other simple games with a finite number of moves (tic-tac-toe, small board checkers, or other chess-based games).
For complete playing directions, respond YES or Y to the ques- t10n, “INSTRUCTIONS?
Computer Limitations
HEX was written in BASIC-PLUS for DIGITAL RSTS-11 and RSTS/E systems. HEX uses string functions and concatenation extensively. Also, the symbol "!" equals REM and "&" equals PRINT.

Hi | L O HIGH/LOW JACKPOT GAME
Description
This game is an adaptation of the game GUESS; however, instead of just guessing a number between land 1007 in this game, you win dollars when you guess the number. The directions, in the words of the author of the game, are as follows:
"7. There is an amount of money, between one and one hundred dollars, in the "HI-LO" jackpot.
2. You will have six chances in which to guess the amount of money in the jackpot.
3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether the guess was too high or too low.
4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after six chances, the computer will print the amount in the jackpot.
5. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the six chance limit, the computer will register this amount.
6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice of playing again or ending the program. If a new game is played, a new amount of money will constitute the jackpot.
7. If you win more than once, then your earnings are to- talled."

REMOVE PEGS ON A PEGBOARD
Description Eaton
This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game of logic called Hi-Q. The game starts with a pegboard shaped like a cross having pegs in every hole but the center. The object is to remove all 32 pegs, or as many as possible, by jumping into an empty hole--the jumped peg is then removed.
There are several different winning strategies for playing Hi-Q and, of course, each strategy can be played eight different ways on the board. Can you find a consistent winner?

HMRABI GOVERN ANCIENT SUMERIA
Description
In this game you direct the administrator of Sumeria, Hamurabi, how to manage the city. The city initially has 1,000 acres, 100 people and 3,000 bushels of grain in storage.
You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for bushels of grain--the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels per acre. You also must use grain to feed your people and as seed to plant the next year's crop.
You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only tend a certain amount of land and that people starve if they
are not fed enough. You also have the unexpected to contend
with such as a plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable harvests.
You will also find that managing just the few resources in this game is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years. The crisis of population density rears its head very rapidly.

Description
This is a simulation of a regulation, three-period ice hockey game. Your opponent is Cornell University. You may use three kinds of shots:
ba fo Laps onoOe 229, ELIUCK-SHOE 32 WEiStsSnot
The game is very comprehensive starting with the face-off, and throughout the game with icing and high sticking penalties, shots hitting the post, shots being wide and being blocked
by the goalie.
In the event of a tie at the end of three periods, the game automatically goes into sudden-death overtime.

Description
BETTING AT A HORSERACE
This program simulates a one-mile horse race for three-year old thoroughbreds. You can place any number of bets on the outcome of the race. There are four elements to a bet:
. ‘Horse number (1 to 8)
- Position (Win=1, Place=2, Show=3)
Amount of wager ($2 minimum, $300 maximum)
- Bet signal (2 for more bets to follow, 0 to’ close betting)
BWNHE e
The computer then gives you the position of the eight horses at eight points around the raceway. At the end, it tells you what each horse paid and what you won (or didn't win) on each of your bets.
Source
The published program has been around DIGITAL for as long as anyone can remember. Its author is now unknown. Other interest- ing horse race programs were submitted by Robert Goodman, Southfield, Mich.; Don Viola, Staten Island, NY; and Paul Garmon, Wellesley Hills, Mass.

HURKLE FIND THE HURKLE IN HIDING
Description
Hurkle? A Hurkle is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy on a planet named Lirht that has three moons. Hurkle are favorite pets of the Gwik, the dominant race of Lirht and... well, to find out more, read "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast"
in the book A WAY HOME by Theodore Sturgeon published by Pyramid.
In this program a shy hurkle is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid: Homebase is point 0,0 in the Southwest corner. Your guess as to the gridpoint where the hurkle is hiding should be a pair of whole numbers, separated by a comma. After each try, the computer will tell you the approximate direction to go look for the Hurkle. You get five guesses to find him.

KINEMA THROW A BALL UP IN THE AIR
Description
This program tests your fundamental knowledge of kinematics. It presents a simple problem: a ball is thrown straight up in the air at some random velocity. You then must answer three questions about the flight of the ball:
1. How thigh will it: ge?
2. How long until it returns to earth?
3. What will be its velocity after a random number of seconds?
The computer evaluates your performance; within 15% of the correct answer is considered close enough. After each run, the computer gives you another problem until you interrupt the program.

LETTER _...........
Description
LETTER is similar to the game GUESS in which you guess a number chosen by the computer; in this program, the computer picks a random letter of the alphabet and you must guess which one it is using the clues provided as you go along. It should not take you more than five guesses to get the mystery letter.
Computer Limitations
This program was adapted for DIGITAL EduSystem 15/30/35 and uses the automatic character string to ASCII conversion feature.
Other systems will require a conversion function as Statement 435.

Li FE JOHN CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
Description
The Game of Life was originally described in Scientific American, October 1970, in an article by Martin Gardner. The game itself was originated by John Conway of Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, England.
In the "manual" game, organisms exist in the form of counters (chips or checkers) on a large checkerboard and die or reproduce according to some simple genetic rules. Conway's criteria for choosing his genetic laws were carefully delineated as follows:
1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a Simple proof that the population can grow without limit.
2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.
3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or from becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.
In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of the population unpredictable. Conway's genetic laws are de- lightfully simple. First note that each cell of the checker- board (assumed to be an infinite plane) has eight neighboring cells, four adjacent orthogonally, four adjacent diagonally. The rules are:
1. Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighboring counters survives for the next generation.
2. Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies (is removed) from overpopulation. Every counter with one neighbor or none dies from isolation.
3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors--no more, no fewer--is a birth cell. A counter is placed on it at the next move.
It is important to understand that all births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together they constitute a single generation or, asewe shall call it, a “move” in-the complete “life-history” Ofthneninicial configurataon.
143
You will find the population constantly undergoing unusual, sometimes beautiful and always unexpected change. Ina few
cases the society eventually dies out (all counters vanishing), although this may not happen until after a great many generations. Most starting patterns either reach stable figures--Conway calls them "still lifes"--that cannot change or patterns that oscillate forever. Patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens the symmetry cannot be lost, although it may increase in richness.
Conway used a DIGITAL PDP-7 with a graphic display to observe long-lived populations. The program here is programmed for a RSTS-11 system. You simply input your initial pattern and ter- minate your input with a Control/Z. The computer then plots successive generations of your population on a 24 (vertical)
by 70= (horizontal) grid. ,Sitback and watch it,

Li FE> 4 2-PERSON GAME OF LIFE
Description ton
LIFE-2 is based on Conway's game of Life. You must be familiar with the rules of LIFE before attempting to play LIFE-2.
There are two players; the game is played on a 5x5 board and each player has a symbol to represent his own pieces of '1life' Live cells belonging to player 1 are represented by '*' and Wave cells belonging to player 2 are represented by the symbol '#'.
The # and * are regarded as the same except when deciding whether to generate a live cell. An empty cell having two '#' and one
'*' for neighbors will generate a '#', i.e. the live cell generated belongs to the player who has the majority of the 3 live cells surrounding the empty cell where life is to be generated, e.g.
A new cell will be generated at (3,3) which will be a '#' since there are two '#' and one '*' surrounding. The board will then become:
146
On the first move each player positions 3 pieces of life on the board by typing in the co-ordinates of the pieces. (In the event of the same cell being chosen by both players that cell is left empty. )
The board is then adjusted to the next generation and printed out. On each subsequent turn each player places one piece on the board, the object being to annihilate his opponent's pieces. The board is adjusted for the next generation and printed out after both players have entered their new piece.
The game continues until one player has no more live pieces. The computer will then print out the board and declare the winner.

MAT HDI PICTORIAL ADDITION PRACTICE
Description
The program presents pictorial drill on addition facts using printed dice with no reading involved. It is good for beginning addition, since the answer can be derived from counting spots
on the dice as well as by memorizing math facts or awareness of number concepts. It is especially effective run on an alpha- numeric CRT terminal.

MNOPLY
GAME OF MONOPOLY
MNOPLY is a simulation of the most popular board game in the
world, Monopoly.
It varies from the actual game only in that
two players are the maximum number that can play.
The dialog during the game presents complete rules and instruc-
tions.
The inputs are designed so that when anything except the
required input is typed in, the entire segment will be ignored. When questions are asked about property to be sold, the full name is required--e.g., STATES AVENUE.
In the computer game, you always pay $50 to get out of jail
unless you have a "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" card.
No double rolls.
As in the board game, before you can improve your property (build houses), you must own all of the pieces of that color property--i.e., have a monopoly of a particular color group.
The program will automatically
if you don't have a color group monopoly.

MUG ; MP... 4 MUGWUMPS IN HIDING
Description
Your objective in this game is to find the four Mugwumps hiding on various squares of a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase (lower left) is position (0,0) and a guess is a pair of whole numbers “(0 -€0.9);, separated by commas. The first number is the number of units
to the right of homebase and the second number is. the distance above homebase.
You get ten guesses to locate the four Mugwumps; after each guess, the computer tells you how close you are to each Mugwump. Play- ing the game with the aid of graph paper and a compass should allow you to find all the Mugwumps in six or seven moves using triangulation--i.e., like LORAN radio navigation.

NICOMA COMPUTER GUESSES YOUR NUMBER
Description
One of the most ancient forms of arithmetical puzzle is sometimes referred to as a "boomerang." At some time, everyone has been asked to "think of a number," and, after going through some process of private calculation, to state the result, after which the questioner promptly tells you the number you originally thought of. There are hundreds of varieties of the puzzle.
The oldest recorded example appears to be that given in Arithmetica of Nicomachus, who died about the year 120. He tells you to
think of any whole number between 1 and 100 and divide it suc- cessively by 3, 5, and 7, telling him the remainder in each case. On receiving this information, he promptly discloses the number
you. thought. of,
Can you discover a simple method of mentally performing this feat? If not, you can see how the ancient mathematician did it by look- ing at Lines 80-100 of the program.

NIM CHINESE GAME OF NIM
Description
NIM is one of the oldest two-person games known to man; it is believed to have originated in ancient China. The name, which was coined by the first mathematician to analyze it, comes from an archaic English verb which means to steal or to take away. Objects are arranged in rows between the two opponents as in the following example:
Kone Oe Row 1 -- 7 Objects EX a OC Row 2 -- 5 Objects GP. Gae e Row 3 -- 3 Objects > Row 4 -- 1 Object
Opponents take turns removing objects until there are none left. The one who picks up the last object wins. The moves are made according to the following two rules:
1. On any given turn only objects from one row may be removed. There is no restriction on which row or on how many objects you remove. Of course, you cannot remove more than are in the row.
2. You cannot skip a move or remove zero objects.
The winning strategy can be mathematically defined, however, rather than presenting it here, we'd rather let you find it on your own. HINT: Play a few games with the computer and mark down on a piece of paper the number of objects in each stack (in binary!) after each move. Do you see a pattern emerging?
Source
One of the most popular computer games. Over 10 versions of NIM were submitted. One notable one came from Larry Ruane, Mt. Prospect, Illinois, who programmed NIM for a DIGITAL EduSystem 10. Quite a feat: The one published is from:

Description
In contrast to other number guessing games where you keep guess-— ing until you get the random number selected by the computer (GUESS, TRAP? .STARS, etc.) in this game you get only one guess per play and you gain or lose points depending upon how close your guess is to the random number selected by the computer.
You occasionally get a jackpot which will double your point count. You win when you get 500 points.

ORBIT
Description
DESTROY AN ORBITING ENEMY SPACESHIP
ORBIT challenges you to visualize spatial positions in polar coordinates. The object is to detonate an explosive within a certain distance of a germ laden spaceship. This ship is orbit- ing a planet at a constant altitude and orbital rate (degrees/ hour). The location of the ship is hidden by a device that renders the ship invisible, but after each bomb you are told how close to the enemy ship your bomb exploded. The challenge is to hit an invisible moving target with a limited number of shots.
The planet can be replaced by a point at its center (called the origin); then the ship's position can be given as a distance from the origin and an angle between its position and the eastern edge of the planet.
direction hip Of VOrDre
angle E
The distance of the bomb from the ship is computed using the law of cosines (see line 430 of the program listing). The law of cosines states
bomb D
ship D= /R**2+D1**2+R*D1*COS (A-Al) hii aie :
where D is the distance between the ship and the bomb, R is the Bl titude sof .the..ship,..Dl is.the altitude of the bomb, and A-Al is the angle between the ship and the bomb.

Aircraft appear on radar as blips of the form "=". What
is the distance between the

PIZZA
Description
DELIVER PIZZAS IN HYATTSVILLE
In this game, you take orders for pizzas from people living in Hyattsville. Armed with a map of the city, you must then tell a delivery boy the address where the pizza is to be delivered. If the pizza is delivered to the correct address, the customer Poenes you and thanks you; if not, you must give the driver the correct address until the pizza gets delivered.
Some interesting modifications suggest themselves for this program such as pizzas getting cold after two incorrect delivery attempts or taking three or more orders at a time and figuring the shortest delivery route. Send us your modifications!

POETRY
Description
RANDOM POETRY (HAIKU)
POETRY: This program will randomly choose a singlet, couplet, or quatrain from a set of 23 preset PRINT statements. It spaces at random intervals, but ends at approximately the same point each time. There is a low likelihood of duplication of lines.
POET: This program produces random verse which might loosely be considered in the Japanese Haiku style. It uses 20 phrases in four groups of five phrases each generally cycling through the groups. It inserts commas (random--19% of the time), indentation (random--22% of the time), and starts new para- graphs (18% probability, but at least every 20 phrases).
The version of POET published has phrases suggestive of Edgar Allen Poe. Try it with phrases from computer technology, from love and romance, from four-year-old children, or from some other subject. Send us the output:
Here are some phrases from nature to try:
Carpet of ferns Mighty Oaks
Morning dew Grace and beauty Tang of dawn Silently singing Swaying pines Nature speaking Entrances me Untouched, unspoiled Soothing me Shades of green Rustling leaves Tranquility
Radiates calm ---SO peaceful

POKER _........
Description
In this game, you play draw poker with the computer as your opponent. At the start of the game, each person has $200. The game ends when either opponent runs out of money (if you run short, the computer gives you a chance to sell your wristwatch or diamond tie tack).
The computer opens the betting before the draw; you open the betting after the draw. If you don't have a hand that's worth anything and want to fold, bet 0. Prior to the draw, to check the draw, you may bet .5. Of course, if the computer has betted, you must match bets (see his bet) in order to draw or, if your hand looks good either before or after the draw, you may always raise the bet.

OU BIC 3-DIMENSIONAL TIC-TAC-TOE
Descri Description
QUBIC is the game of tic-tac-toe in a 4x4x4 cube. You must get 4 markers in a row or diagonal along any 3-dimensional plane
in order to win. It is up to you to keep track of moves (the program does not print out a diagram as you play).
Each move is indicated by a 3-digit number (digits not separated by commas), with each digit between 1 and 4 inclusive. The digits indicate the level, column, and row, respectively, of
the move. YOU Can win.af you play.correctly; although, it ds considerably more difficult than standard, two-dimensional 3x3 tic-tac-toe.
Source
QUBIC seems to have first shown up on a G.E. timesharing system in 1968. Its original author is unknown.

Description
ONE CHESS QUEEN
This game is based on the permissible moves of the chess queen-- i.e., along any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. In this game, the queen can only move to the left, down, and diagonally down to the left.
The object of the game is to place the queen (one only) in the lower left-hand square (no. 150), by alternating moves between you and the computer. The one to place the queen there wins.
You go first and place the queen in any one of the squares on the top row or the right-hand column. That is your first move. The computer is beatable, but it takes some figuring. See if you can devise a winning strategy.

Description
The game of REVERSE requires you to arrange a list of numbers in numerical order from left to right. To move, you tell the computer how many numbers (counting from the left) to reverse. For example, if the current ier:
Dias 3 eA. eae Gad 37 HO 9
and you reverse 4, the result will be: Boe 4. 53 2 OR IRS Ge (eG: PaO
Now if you reverse 5, you win:
There are many ways to beat the game, but approaches tend to be either algorithmic or heuristic. The game thus offers the player a chance to play with these concepts in a practical (rather, than theoretical) context.
An algorithmic approach guarantees a solution in a predictable number of moves, given the number of items in ‘the Tistw< <or example, one method guarantees a solution in 2N - 3 moves when the list contains N numbers. The essence of an algorithmic approach is that you know in advance what your next move will be. One could easily program a computer to do this.
A heuristic approach takes advantage of "partial orderings" in the list at any moment. Using this type of approach, your next move is dependent on the way the list currently appears. This way of solving the problem does not guarantee a solution in a predictable number of moves, but if you are lucky and clever, you may come out ahead of the algorithmic solutions. One could not so easily program this method.
In practice, many players adopt a "mixed" strategy, with both algorithmic and heuristic features. Is this better than either “pure stracvegy?

ROCKET... AN APOLLO CAPSULE ON THE MOON
Description
ROCKET, known also as LUNAR, LEM, and APOLLO, is by far and away the single most popular computer game. It exists in versions
that start you anywhere from 500 feet to 200 miles above the
moon, or other planets, too. Some allow the control of directional stabilization rockets and/or the retro rocket. The three versions presented here appear to be the most popular of the many varia- trons.
ROCKET... In this program, you set the burn rate.of the retro rockets (pounds of fuel per second) every 10 seconds and attempt to achieve a soft landing on the moon. 200 lbs/sec really puts the brakes Oon,.and 0 lbs/sec 1S free falls” Ignition, oecurs at
8 lbs/sec, so do not use burn rates between 1 and 7 ibsfsec.
To make the landing more of a challenge, but more closely ap- proximate the real Apollo LEM capsule, you should make the aveitablewtuel vatuthe start -(N) equal’ to 16,0007 Ibs, vand- ene weight of the capsule (M) equal to 32,500 lbs in Statement 15.
Some computers object to the series expansion calculations in Statements 91 and 94 (as you near the lunar surface, these numbers get very small). If yours does, substitute the expanded form--for the expansion in Statement 91:
SO lO 172702 (U/340*.(1/47075)'))) } You should be able to figure the other one out yourself.
ROCKT1. In this version, you start 500 feet above the lunar surface and control the burn rate in l-second bursts. Each unit of fuel slows your descent by 1 ft/sec. The maximum thrust of your engine is 30 ft/sec/sec.
ROCKT2. This is the most comprehensive of the three versions and permits you to control the time interval of firing, the thrust, and the attitude angle. It also allows you to work in the metric or English system of measurement. The instructions
in the program dialog are very complete, so you shouldn't have any trouble.
In most versions Of ROCKET, the temptation is to slow up too soon and then have no fuel left for the lower part of the journey. This, of course, is disasterous (as you will find out when you land your own capsule)!

To put all the conflicting stories to rest, we can say with confidence that ROCKET was originally written in FOCAL by a Lexington High School student back in the mid 60's.

ROCKSP GAME OF ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER
Description
Remember the game of rock-scissors-paper. You and your opponent make a motion three times with your fists and then either show a flat hand (paper), fist. (rock); or two fingers (scissors). Depending upon what is shown, the game is a tie (both show the same) or One person wins. Paper wraps up rock, so it wins. Scissors cut paper, so it wins. And rock breaks scissors,
so it wins.
In this computerized version of rock-scissors-paper, you can play up to ten games vs. the computer.

ROULET EUROPEAN ROULETTE TABLE
Description :
This game simulates a European Roulette wheel; "European" because it has 37 number compartments (1 to 36 and 0). The American wheel has 38 numbers (1 to 36, O and 00). The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and South American countries are slowly switching to the American wheel because it gives the house a bigger percentage. Odd and even numbers alternate around the wheel, as do red and black. The layout of the wheel insures a highly random number pattern. In fact, roulette wheels are sometimes used to generate tables of random numbers.
In this game, you may bet from $1 to $10,000 and you may bet on red or black, odd or even, a column, or single number.
There is no long-range winning strategy for playing roulette. However, a good strategy is that of "doubling." First spin, bet $1 on an even/fodds bet (odd, even, red, or black). If you lose, double your bet to $2. If you lose again, double to $4. Continue to double until you win (i.e., you break even on a losing sequence). As soon as you win, bet $1 again, and after every win, bet $1. Do not ever bet more than $1 unless you are recuperating losses by doubling. Do not ever bet anything but the even odds bets. Good luck:
source Like so many other games of chance, computerized ROULET has been
around a long time in FORTRAN, LISP, and so on. Its original author is unknown today.

SALVO Eo
Description
The rules are not explained by the program, so read carefully this description by Larry Siegel, the program author.
"SALVO is played on a 10x10 grid or board using an x,y coordinate system. The player has 4 ships: battleship (5 squares), cruiser (3 squares), and two destroyers (2 squares each). The ships
must be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and must not overlap. The ships do not move during the game.
"As long as any square of a battleship still survives, the player is allowed three shots, for a cruiser 2 shots, and for each destroyer 1 shot. Thus, at the beginning of the game the player has 3+2+1+1=7 shots. The player enters all of his shots and
the computer tells what was hit." A shot is entered by its grid coordinates, x,y. The winner is the one who sinks all of the opponent's ships.
Important note: Your ships and the computer's ships are located
on 2 separate 10x10 boards. For a simpler version of this game, troy SALVO1.

SALVO!
Description
ARMY GUN BATTLE
SALVOL is played on two, 5x5 grids or boards with 25 outpost locations numbered 1 to 25. Both you and the computer have four platoons of troops that can be located at any four out- posts on your respective grids.
At the start of the game, you locate (or hide) your four platoons on your grid. The computer does the same on its grid. You then take turns firing missiles or bombs at each other's outposts trying to destroy all four platoons.,-,-The one who finds all four opponent's platoons first, wins.

Description
SLOT MACHINE
The slot machine or one-arm bandit is a mechanical device that will absorb coins just about as fast as you can feed, zt... ALcCer inserting a coin, you pull a handle that sets three independent reels spinning. If the reels stop with certain symbols appear- ing in the pay line, you get a certain payoff. The original slot machine, called the Liberty Bell, was invented in 1895
by Charles Fey in San Francisco. Fey refused to sell or lease the manufacturing rights, so H.S. Mills in Chicago Hpuplesa similar, but much improved, machine called the Operators Bell. This has survived nearly unchanged to today.
On the Operators Bell and other standard slot machines, there are 20 symbols on each wheel but they are not distributed evenly among the objects (cherries, bar, apples, etc.). Of
the 8,000 possible combinations, the expected payoff (to the Iblaver)ais/,049 or $89.11 for every $100.00: put in, one of the lowest expected payoffs of all casino games.
In the program here, the payoff is considerably more liberal; indeed it favors the player by 11%--i.e., an expected payoff of $111 for each $100 bet. To approximate Nevada odds, reduce the jackpot to $15 and keno to $4.
Source Lots of slot machine programs were submitted including a very
nice one by Rob Hoffberg of Roslyn, NY. The author of the one published is unknown.

SPAC R SPACEWAR BASED ON STAR TREK
Description
This program is an incredibly complete version of spacewar. You are Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise and have as your mission to destroy a certain number of enemy Klingon spaceships (generally around 24) and thus keep the galaxy safe for democracy. You must complete your mission in 30 stardates (measure of time in space--think of it as a day).
The galaxy is divided into 64 quadrants arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each quadrant is in turn divided into 64 sectors, also in an
8x8 grid arrangement. It, of course, costs time and fuel to get from one quadrant to another.
Complete playing instructions are given if you answer YES to the question, DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS?
Note: This program appears to have one or two minor bugs. It's eminently usable, but occasionally funny little things happen.

SPLAT
Description
OPEN A PARACHUTE AT THE LAST MOMENT
SPLAT simulates a parachute jump in which you try to open your "chute at the last possible moment without going splat: You may select your own terminal velocity or let the computer do
it for you. You may also select the acceleration due to gravity or, again, let the computer do it in which case you might wind up on any of the eight planets (out to Neptune), the moon, or sun.
The computer then tells you the height you're jumping from and asks for the seconds of free fall. It then divides your free fall time into eight intervals and gives you progress reports on your way down. The computer also keeps track of all prior jumps in the file PARACH.UTE and lets you know how you compared with previous successful jumps.

STARS A NUMBER GUESSING GAME
Description
In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100 (or any value you set in Statement 150). You try to guess the number and the computer gives you clues to tell you how close you're getting. One star (*) means you're far away from the number; seven stars (*******) means you're really close. You get 7 guesses.
On the surface this game is very similar to GUESS; however, the guessing strategy is quite different. See if you can come up with one or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

STOCK PLAY THE STOCK MARKET
Description
This program "plays" the stock market. You will be given $10,000 and may buy or sell stocks. Stock prices and trends are generated randomly; therefore, this model does not represent exactly what happens on the exchange. (Depending upon your point of view, you may feel this is quite a good representation!)
Every trading day, a table of stocks, their prices, and number of shares in your portfolio is printed. Following this, the initials of each stock are printed followed by a question mark. You in- dicate your transaction in number of shares--a positive number
to buy, negative number to sell, or 0 to do no trading. A brokerage fee of 1% is charged on all transactions (a bargain!). Note: Even if the value of a stock drops to zero, it may re- bound again--then again, it may not.

SYNONM rc cvv
Description
A synonym of a word is another word in the English language which has the same, or very nearly the same, meaning. This program tests your knowledge of synonyms of a few common words.
The computer chooses a word and asks you for a synonym. The computer then tells you whether you're right or wrong. Li you can't think of a synonym, type "HELP" which causes a synonym to be printed.
You may put in words of your choice in the data statements (510-600) . The number following DATA in Statement 500 is the total number of data statements. In each data statement, the “first number
is the number of words in that statement.
Can you think of a way to make this into a more general kind of CAI program for any subject?

ARGET DESTROY A TARGET IN 3-D SPACE
Description
In this program, you are firing a weapon from a spaceship in 3-dimensional space. Your ship, the Starship Enterprise, is located at the origin (0,0,0) of a set of x,y,Z coordinates. You will be told the approximate location of the target in 3-dimensional rectangular coordinates, the approximate angular deviation from the x and z axes in both radius and degrees, and the approximate distance to the target.
Given this information, you then proceed to shoot at the target. A shot within 20 kilometers of the target destroys it. After each shot, you are given information as to the position OfFene explosion of your shot and a somewhat improved estimate of the location of the target. Fortunately, this is just practice
and the target doesn't shoot back. After you have attained proficiency, you ought to be able to destroy a target in 3 or 4 shots. However, attaining proficiency might take a while:

TO : ; ER TOWERS OF HANOI PUZZLE
Description
This is a simulation of a game of logic that originated in the middle Fast. It is sometimes called Pharoah's Needles, but its most common name is the Towers of Hanoi.
Legend has it that a secret society of monks live beneath the city of Hanoi. They possess three large towers or needles on which different size gold disks may be placed. Moving one at a time and never placing a larger on a smaller disk, the monks endeavor to move the tower of disks from the left needle to the right needle. Legend says when they have finished moving this 64-disk tower, the world will end. How many moves will they have to make to accomplish this? If they can move l disk per minute and work 24 hours per day, how many years will it take?
In the computer puzzle you are faced with three upright needles. On the leftmost needle are placed from two to seven graduated disks, the largest being on the bottom and smallest on the top. Your object is to move the entire stack of disks to the right- most needle. However, you may only move one disk at a time
and you may never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
Q
In this computer game, the disks are referred to by their size--i.e., the smallest is 3,
Ne wee, 7; Ovo pande 15. “LL -you*p lay with fewer than 7 disks always use the largest, i.e. with 2 disks you would use nos. 13 and
L5. ‘The program instructions ~are<sel£f- explanatory. Good luck:

TRAIN
Description
TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE QUIZ
TRAIN is a program which uses the computer to generate problems with random initial conditions to teach about the time-speed- distance relationship (distance = rate x time). You then input your answer and the computer verifies your response.
TRAIN is merely an example of a student-generated problem. Maximum fun (and benefit) comes more from writing programs like this as opposed to solving the specific problem posed. Exchange your program with others - you solve their problem
and let them solve yours.

TRAP
Description
TRAP A MYSTERY NUMBER
Another of the family of "guess the mystery number" games, in TRAP the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 (or other limit set in statement 20). Your object is to find the number. On each guess, you enter 2 numbers trying to trap the mystery number between your two trap numbers. The computer will tell you if its number is larger or smaller than your trap numbers or if you have trapped the number.
To win the game, you must guess the mystery number by entering it as the same value for both of your trap numbers. You get
6 guesses (this should be changed in statement 10 if you change the guessing limit in statement PAWN jae
After you have played GUESS, STARS, and TRAP, compare the guessing strategy you have found best for each game. Do you notice any similarities? What are the differences? Can you write a new guessing game with still another approach?

TRAP was suggested by 10-year old when he was playing GUESS. It was originally programmed by Steve Ullman and extensively modified into its final form by:

Description
In the game of twenty-three matches, you start with 23 matches lying on a table. on each turn, you may take l, 2, or 3 matches. You alternate moves with the computer and the one who has to
take the last match loses.
The easiest way to devise a winning strategy is to start at the end of the game. Since you wish to leave the last match to your opponent, you would like to have either 4, 3, or 2 on your last turn so you can take away 3, 2, or 1 and leave 1. Consequently, you would like to leave your opponent with 5 on his next to last turn so, no matter what his move, you are left with 4, 3, or 2. Work this backwards to the begin- ning and you'll find the game can effectively be won on the first move. Fortunately, the computer gives you the first move, so if you play wisely, you can win.
After you've mastered 23 Matches, move on to BATNUM and then COLNIM:

\ é AR CARD GAME OF WAR
Description
This program plays the card game of War. In War, the card deck is shuffled, then two cards are dealt, one to each player. Players compare cards and the higher card (numeri- cally) wins. In case of tie, no one wins. The game ends when you have gone through the whole deck, (52 cards, 26 games) or when you decide to quit.
The computer gives cards by suit and number, for example, 5-7 is the 7 of spades.
Note: The *G in some of the PRINT statements (470,650) indicates the ringing of the teletype bell.

: VAR 2 TROOP TACTICS IN WAR
Description
In this game, you are fighting a small-scale war with the computer. You have 72,000 troops which you first must distribute into your Army, Navy, and Air Force. You may distribute them in any way you choose as long as you don't use more than 72,000.
You then attach your opponent (the computer) and input which service and the number of men you wish to use. The computer then tells you the outcome of the battle, gives you the current statistics and allows you to determine your next move.
After the second battle, it is decided from the total statistics whether you win or lose or if a treaty is signed.

ORD WORD GUESSING GAME
Description
WORD is similar to Hangman in that the player must guess a word with clues as to letter position furnished by the computer. However, instead of guessing one letter at a time, in WORD, you guess an entire word (or group of 5 letters, such as ABCDE). The computer will tell you if any letters in your word are in the mystery word and if any of them are in the correct position. Armed with these clues, you go on guessing until you get the word or, if you can ct *get Lt, input a "?" and the computer will tell you the mystery word.
You may change the words in Data Statements 512 and Slo7ebpuc they must be 5-letter words.

YAHTZE coe.
Description
Yahtzee may be played by up to 15 people. The object of the game is to get the highest grand total score. Each player on his turn receives from the computer the values Ofte
pseudo dice. He may then roll as many of them as he wants
to again. This may be repeated once again (3 rolls maximum). To roll again, you tell the computer how many dice you want to re-roll or change and the number of each die. You play 13 rounds for a complete game.
After you have finished rolling, you must decide how you want to score the five dice. Typing "SUMMAR " will show you which categories have been used, otherwise, you must decide on one of 13 categories or "ZERO" to eliminate a category with no score.
Category How Scored
ACES Count and add all ones.
TWOS Count and add all twos.
THREES Count and add all threes.
FOURS Count and add all fours.
FIVES Count and add all fives.
SIXES Count and add all sixes.
THREE OF A KIND Total all 5 dice (assuming 3 of a kind). FOUR OF A KIND Total all 5 dice (assuming 4 of a kind). FULL HOUSE 25 Points (3 of one kind, 2 of another). SMALL STRAIGHT 30 Points (Sequence of 4).
LARGE STRAIGHT 40 Points (Sequence of 5).
YAHTZEE 50. Points “oeota, Kind) <
CHANCE Total of all 5 dice.
ZERO Zero out any category above.
If your accumulated score of the first six categories ever reaches 63 points, you receive a bonus of 35 points.

ZOOP
Description
BASIC PROGRAMMER'S NIGHTMARE
ZOOP is designed to imitate the system commands of a BASIC compiler, however, it gives totally meaningless and frustrating results. For example, to the command:
CAT
ZOOP responds with:
TRY MONTGOMERY WARD's
To the command: SCRATCH
ZOOP responds with:
GOT AN “ITCH?
Computer Limitations
The version of ZOOP printed here was written for DIGITAL Edusystems 15/30/35 and immediately decodes the first two characters input and carries on from there. It is a simple matter to convert ZOOP to a system which has string handling, however, it was felt that this version is more creative. It also happens to be the original.

APPENDIX C
INSTRUCTIONS TO GAME AUTHORS
Programs must be complete and debugged, BASIC language only.
Please submit: A. One program listing and B. Two sample runs the way an average person would play.
Listing and run must be on white, unlined paper. If you have lined paper, turn it around to the unlined side. We absolutely cannot handle submittals on pink, yellow, blue
or gray paper. Xerox, Ditto, or other copies are also unacceptable. Make as few folds in the output as possible.
Listing and run must be done with a fresh black ribbon. Not a purple or blue ribbon and especially not a used ribbon.
The Teletype type ball must be clean and produce crisp copy. Clean the ball with typewriter type cleaner or a stiff toothbrush.
If possible, submit a paper tape of the program. Unoiled fan-fold tape is preferable. If you have oiled paper tape (as from a Teletype), fan fold it (folds are 8%" apart), leave at least 17" blank leader and 8%" trailer tape. Rolled paper tape or fan folds much greater or less than 84" cannot be handled on our high-speed readers and are unusable for making copies. Be sure to wrap oiled paper tape in kitchen plastic wrap or waxed paper when you mail it. If you don't the oil seeps out and smears the output. Oil seepage has ruined any number of otherwise excellent submittals.
We also have to know:
A. Your name E. Your age
B. Complete address F. Computer system used
C. Telephone G. Original source of program D. School affiliation CtEenOee Vow)
By submitting a program, you are giving Digital Equipment Corp. the right to publish, reprint, distribute, or use your program in any other way. You will, of course, always be cited as the author.
