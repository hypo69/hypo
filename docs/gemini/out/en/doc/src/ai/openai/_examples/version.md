# hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/version.py

## Overview

This module, located in the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples` directory, likely defines versioning information and potentially other metadata for a software component.  It appears to be configured for different operating systems (Windows and Unix) and possibly different execution environments (e.g., using virtual environments).


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: This variable likely controls the operation mode of the module (e.g., development, production).

**Value**: `'dev'`


### `__version__`

**Description**: This variable holds the version string for the module or package.

**Value**: `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`


### `__name__`

**Description**:  This variable contains the name of the module.  If executed directly, its value will be `"__main__"`.

**Value**: `str` (dynamic)


### `__doc__`

**Description**:  The module's documentation string.

**Value**: `str` (dynamic)


### `__details__`

**Description**: This variable likely contains additional details about the module, version or class.

**Value**: `"Details about version for module or class"`


### `__annotations__`

**Description**: Contains type annotations for variables and functions in the module.  This is likely an empty dictionary or a collection of annotations.

**Value**: (likely empty)


### `__author__`

**Description**: The name(s) of the author(s) of the module.

**Value**: `'hypotez '`


## Documentation Notes

The code includes numerous multiline strings (docstrings) that are not being utilized to generate detailed documentation in the comments. These docstrings, if formatted according to the Python documentation guidelines, would be important for building comprehensive documentation.


## Potential Improvements

To enhance the documentation, consider using structured docstrings within the Python code, as these provide more readable information than the multiline strings in the current format. The format should include `Args`, `Returns`, `Raises` sections for functions, and a `Description` section for classes. Adding more explicit descriptions and explanations for each variable (like `__details__`) can significantly improve the usefulness of the documentation. Also, specify the `__name__`'s data type.
