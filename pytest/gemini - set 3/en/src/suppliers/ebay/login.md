**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Import:** The code imports the `login.py` module correctly.  Crucially, you need to use the correct path to your file.

2. **Missing Functions:** The provided `login.py` file only contains docstrings and a `MODE` constant. There are no functions to test.  The commented-out test cases assume the existence of a `login` function (e.g., for a web driver login).

3. **Realistic Testing:** The example test cases are placeholders. To write actual tests, you need to understand what the `login` function (or similar functions) do, the expected behavior, and how to simulate the necessary inputs and outputs.

4. **Error Handling:**  The examples include `pytest.raises` for checking exceptions.  This is crucial for robustness.  The tests now appropriately check for `ValueError` if the username or password is `None` or empty string, which wasn't done before.

5. **Data Simulation:**  The tests should be independent.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive login information directly in the tests. Use mock objects or fake data (e.g., fixture) for inputs and simulate the function's behavior.

6. **Context:** To effectively write tests, you need to understand the context of the login function.  What is it supposed to do? What are its arguments, return values, and exceptions?

7. **WebDriver Integration (If Applicable):** If the `login` function interacts with a web driver, you'll need to use tools to simulate the webdriver interaction or create mock objects for webdriver methods.  This is beyond the scope of the provided code.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_login.py`).
2.  **Run:** Run pytest from the command line in the directory containing `test_login.py` and `login.py` :
    ```bash
    pytest test_login.py
    ```


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the actual code and logic of the `login` function.  These examples will give you a structure for robust `pytest` tests.
