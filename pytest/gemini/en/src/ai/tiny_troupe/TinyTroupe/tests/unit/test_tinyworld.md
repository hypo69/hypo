```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_run_empty_world`).

2. **Meaningful Actions:** The `test_run_populated_world` now includes a `broadcast` to simulate agent interaction, which is crucial for meaningful testing.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Added `pytest.raises` for testing edge cases, e.g., when an attribute of a `TinyWorld` is invalid.


4. **Parameterization:** The `test_encode_complete_state_invalid` test uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different invalid attribute scenarios (edge case).


5. **Edge Cases (Important):** The tests now include more comprehensive edge cases, such as an empty world and invalid input data.


6. **Thoroughness:** Tests ensure that the original state of the world is maintained after a `decode_complete_state` call.

7. **Robustness:** Added tests to catch exceptions in `encode_complete_state`, to check that the function handles invalid attributes gracefully.



**Crucial Considerations:**

* **`testing_utils`:**  This solution assumes you have a `testing_utils` module (or similar) that provides any necessary helper functions or fixture setup.  If you don't have one, you'll need to add the required setup and data creation logic.

* **`focus_group_world` fixture:**  Ensure that the `focus_group_world` fixture (used in your tests) properly creates and populates the `TinyWorld` object.  The current solution does not have a `setup` fixture, which is important for setting up the test environment.  Modify the setup process within your `testing_utils` module if necessary.

* **Valid Data:** Provide meaningful data for the world and agents, as this will be essential for the tests to have substantial value.


By incorporating these improvements, the tests become more comprehensive and helpful in ensuring the correctness of the `TinyWorld` class. Remember to adapt the testing scenarios to match the specific functionality and constraints of your code. Remember to adapt the examples to use actual objects and data to test the functions thoroughly.
