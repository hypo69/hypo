**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import necessary modules:**  `pytest`, `json`, `pathlib`, and the target module (`set_project_root`) are imported.

2. **Temporary Directory Handling:** The tests now create temporary directories and files to isolate the tests and prevent side effects from one test to another.  Critically,  the code now removes the temporary directories after each test execution (`shutil.rmtree()`). This prevents test failures from accumulating temporary files.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test function names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately obvious.

4. **Edge Cases:** `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` is added to handle the scenario where no marker files are found. This shows proper handling of a missing marker.


5. **Error Handling:**  Tests are added to specifically check for the cases when the marker files are not found in the expected location or if there's a problem accessing the marker files.


6. **`pytest.raises` (not used):** The code was changed; therefore, `pytest.raises` is not needed in the current test form.


7. **`sys.path` Check (Crucial):**  The `test_set_project_root_in_sys_path` test is added to verify that the function correctly adds the project root to `sys.path` if it's not already present. This is essential for the function's intended behavior.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling in the Original Code:** The original code has `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. The tests should also cover these cases, verifying that the `except` blocks are handling the errors correctly in the real code.
- **Realistic Data:** Create test data similar to what the function would receive in a normal execution.  Use `json.dumps` to create valid JSON data files for `settings.json` to test the load function.

Remember to adapt these tests further based on specific expected behaviors, exceptions, and edge cases in your `set_project_root` function and the `gs` module (`gs.path.root`).  This comprehensive set of tests better captures the function's logic and handling of various scenarios.
