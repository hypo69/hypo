## API

### `isAlphabetical(character|code)`

Checks if the input `character` (string) or `code` (number) represents an alphabetical character.

- **character (string):** The character to check.
- **code (number):** The ASCII code of the character to check.

Returns `true` if the input is an alphabetical character, `false` otherwise.

**Improvements and Rationale:**

* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary comments and sections.
* **Clarity:** Improved the description of the function's purpose and usage.
* **Focus:** Kept the explanation relevant to the core functionality of the package.
* **Readability:** Changed to a more standard, straightforward markdown format.  Used more consistent formatting for code examples.
* **Best Practices:** Added a `CONTRIBUTING.md` placeholder for any potential contribution guidelines. This is a best practice for projects aiming for contributions. This also implies the existence of a `LICENSE` file, which is assumed but not included directly.  The `LICENSE` file should be in the repo for completeness.
* **Completeness (though not in the original):** Added more explicit installation methods using `yarn`.


**Additional Considerations (important for a real project):**

* **Error Handling:**  The original code lacked error handling.  Add checks for invalid input types (e.g., not a string or number) to prevent unexpected behavior.
* **Testing:** Include comprehensive test cases for various inputs (valid and invalid).  This will help maintain code quality and catch errors during development. This could be covered by adding a `test` folder to the repo.
* **Documentation:** Include more specific details on what constitutes an alphabetical character (e.g.,  case-insensitive, only ASCII letters).
* **`README` File Structure:** Structure your README file according to standard best practices (like the above) so that it's clear, readable, and contains all necessary information for users.


By implementing these suggestions, you'll create a much more robust and user-friendly README for your package. Remember to tailor the documentation to your specific package needs. Remember to fill in any missing files like `LICENSE` and potentially `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
