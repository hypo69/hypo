**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  The code now correctly imports the `pytest` library.
2. **Import `tiny_troupe`:**  Crucially, it imports the module you want to test (`tiny_troupe`). Replace `tiny_troupe` with the actual module name if different.
3. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are descriptive (e.g., `test_add_member_duplicate`).
4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` and other exceptions as appropriate.  The `excinfo` object gives you access to the exception's details.
5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Covers adding valid members, adding duplicate members (and checking the correct error message), removing valid members, removing non-existent members, handling empty troupes, and getting members from a populated troupe.
6. **Example Structure:**  The example structure is followed.
7. **Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.
8. **Edge Case:** The initial code had no edge cases. I've added tests for an empty troupe, removing a non-existent member, and handling a larger input.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_tiny_troupe.py`).
2.  Make sure the `tiny_troupe` module (or whatever it's called) is in the same directory or in a location importable from your test file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_tiny_troupe.py`.

**Important:**  Replace the comments and placeholder parts with the actual functions and classes from your `tiny_troupe` module.  This improved structure is a significant starting point and should give you a good set of tests for that particular example and will allow you to expand upon them. Remember to test all possible scenarios based on the implementation of `tiny_troupe` for thoroughness. Remember to replace placeholders and add tests for other methods or classes as needed.  Provide more context on the `tiny_troupe` module if you want even more tailored tests.
