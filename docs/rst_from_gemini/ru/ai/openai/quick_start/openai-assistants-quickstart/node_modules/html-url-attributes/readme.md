## What is this?

This package provides information about HTML attributes that contain URLs as values.


## When should I use this?

Use this package when you need to process or manipulate URLs within HTML content, such as during URL rewriting or validation.


## Installation

This package is ESM only.

In Node.js (version 16+):

```bash
npm install html-url-attributes
```

In Deno using esm.sh:

```typescript
import { urlAttributes } from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@3'
```

In browsers using esm.sh (with bundling):

```html
<script type="module">
  import { urlAttributes } from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@3?bundle';
  console.log(urlAttributes.href);
</script>
```


## Usage

```typescript
import { urlAttributes } from 'html-url-attributes';

console.log(urlAttributes.formAction); // Output: ['button', 'input']
console.log(urlAttributes.href);      // Output: ['a', 'area', 'base', 'link']
```


## API

This package exports the `urlAttributes` identifier.  There is no default export.

### `urlAttributes`

A `Record<string, Array<string> | null>` containing HTML URL properties.

Each key represents a property name, and each value is either an array of tag names the property applies to, or `null` if it applies to all elements.


## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to the WHATWG HTML standard, the same standard followed by all modern browsers.


## Syntax Tree

The syntax tree used is [hast][].


## Types

This package uses [TypeScript][] for full type safety.


## Compatibility

This package is compatible with maintained versions of Node.js, specifically targeting Node.js 16 and later.  Support for older versions may be dropped in future releases.


## Security

Rewriting HTML, including URL attributes, can introduce security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS).  Always use a sanitization library like [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to prevent XSS attacks.
