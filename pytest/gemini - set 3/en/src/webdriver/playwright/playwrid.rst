**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `@patch` to mock the `logger` object. This prevents actual logging calls from interfering with the tests. The `mock_logger` object allows us to verify if the `info` method was called with the expected message.
* **Error Handling:**  The test `test_playwrid_invalid_url` now uses `pytest.raises` to check if the `start` method correctly handles an exception and logs the error.
* **Fixture for custom settings:** A `settings_custom_data` fixture is introduced to handle custom settings more cleanly.  This makes it easier to test different settings scenarios.
* **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  The docstrings are improved to better describe the purpose of each test case.
* **Realistic Mocking:** The `mock_load_settings` and `mock_set_launch_options` are now properly mocked so that we test the interactions with the `Playwrid` class accurately.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_playwrid.py`) in the same directory as your `playwrid.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_playwrid.py`

This revised solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for the `playwrid` class, especially dealing with error handling and different configurations. Remember to adapt the fixture `settings_custom_data` to match your actual settings if necessary. Remember to have the `crawlee.playwright_crawler` module, `src` module, `src.utils`, `src.logger` properly imported and available in your project.
