```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes provided in the input code, so no tests can be written.
#  To create tests, you need to provide the actual functions, classes, and methods from the file.
# Example test demonstrating the structure if functions were provided
# Example:


# def test_example_function_valid_input():
#     """Checks correct behavior with valid input."""
#     result = example_function(10)
#     assert result == 20  # Replace with expected output for example_function

# def test_example_function_invalid_input():
#     """Checks correct handling of invalid input."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         example_function("invalid") # Replace with expected error type and input

# # Example fixture (if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def example_data():
#     """Provides test data for the function."""
#     return {"key": "value"}


```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided input code (`hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/locators/__init__.py`) is just a file header and imports.  It doesn't contain any functions or classes for which to write tests.  To create meaningful tests, you need to supply the actual Python code that defines the functions and classes to be tested.  The example solution demonstrates the structure and principles of writing `pytest` tests but cannot be directly applied to the current input.

**How to proceed:**

1. **Provide the complete Python code:**  Paste the actual code from `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/locators/__init__.py` that contains the functions, classes, and methods you want to test.

2. **Identify testable units:**  Break down the code into smaller, testable units (functions or classes).  Each test should focus on a single unit of functionality.

3. **Design test cases:** For each testable unit:
   * **Valid inputs:**  Test with various valid inputs to ensure the function/method behaves as expected.
   * **Invalid/unexpected inputs:** Test with inputs that are out of range, invalid types, or otherwise unexpected. Use `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions.
   * **Edge cases and boundary conditions:**  Test values at the limits of the function's input range (minimum, maximum, or near-minimum/maximum).
   * **Error handling:** Check if the function/method handles exceptions correctly and returns appropriate error messages or values.


Once you provide the code, I can generate a set of `pytest` tests based on that specific code. Remember to replace placeholders like `example_function` and `example_data` with the actual names of your functions and data structures. Remember to handle imports correctly within the tests.
