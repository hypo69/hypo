**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses mock classes (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge`) instead of relying on actual Selenium WebDriver classes.  This is crucial for unit testing metaclasses; otherwise, you'd need a webdriver instance, which is too complex for this level of testing.

2. **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used to efficiently run tests with different WebDriver types (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge`), which is a much cleaner and more maintainable approach than repeating the same test multiple times.

3. **Comprehensive Tests:** Tests now cover:
   - Valid WebDriver class input.
   - Initialization with arguments (`*args`).
   - Initialization with keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).
   - Invalid WebDriver class input (using `pytest.raises`).
   - Checking the `driver_payload` call.
4. **Clearer Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test case.
5. **Robustness:** Handles the edge case of passing an invalid webdriver class.


**To run these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the test code (including the mock classes) as a Python file (e.g., `test_driver.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_driver.py
    ```


This revised solution provides a more robust and maintainable set of tests for the metaclass. Remember to replace the mock classes with actual Selenium imports if you need to test with real WebDriver instances.  However, testing the *behavior* of the dynamic class creation with real WebDrivers would likely involve integration tests (outside the scope of a focused metaclass test).
