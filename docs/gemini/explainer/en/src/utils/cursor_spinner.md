* **Initialize:** Set `duration` and `delay` variables.
* **Get Spinner:** Create a `spinner` generator using `spinning_cursor`.
* **Calculate End Time:** Calculate the time when the spinner should stop (`end_time`).
* **Is time < end_time?:** Checks if the current time is less than the calculated `end_time`.
* **Print next char:** Retrieves the next character from the `spinner` generator and prints it to `stdout`.
* **Flush stdout:** Ensures the character is immediately displayed in the console.
* **Sleep for delay:** Pauses the execution for the specified `delay`.
* **Backspace:** Moves the cursor back to overwrite the previous character, effectively creating the spinning effect.
* **End:** When `time` exceeds `end_time`, the loop ends.
* **Print "Done!":** Prints "Done!" to the console after the spinner finishes.
* **Exit:** The program exits.

**Example Data Flow:**

If `duration = 2` and `delay = 0.5`, the program will print characters '|', '/', '-', '\\' every 0.5 seconds for 2 seconds, overwriting each other.


**<explanation>**

* **Imports:**
    * `time`: Provides time-related functions, used for controlling the delay and duration of the spinner.  Crucial for the timed animation.
    * `sys`:  Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, particularly `sys.stdout` for controlling console output.  Essential for direct interaction with the terminal.
    * These imports are standard Python libraries and are not specific to other `src.` packages, making them simple to understand and use in a utility module.

* **Classes:** There are no classes in this code; only functions are defined.

* **Functions:**
    * `spinning_cursor()`:
        * Arguments: None
        * Return value: A generator that yields characters '|', '/', '-', and '\\'.
        * Functionality: Creates a generator that continuously yields the next character in the sequence ('|', '/', '-', '\\'). This is an infinite iterator, so it will keep generating characters until it's used in a loop or explicitly stopped.  This is vital for the animation, producing a stream of characters.
        * Example usage: The example in the docstring illustrates how to use the generator to retrieve and process each character.
    * `show_spinner(duration, delay)`:
        * Arguments:
            * `duration` (float): The duration (in seconds) for the spinner to run. Defaults to 5.0 seconds.
            * `delay` (float): The delay (in seconds) between each character in the spinner sequence. Defaults to 0.1 seconds.
        * Return value: None
        * Functionality: Controls the display of the spinner by setting the duration, controlling the delay for the spinner animation, and handling the backspace character. This function orchestrates the overall process of showing the spinner.
        * Example Usage: The example call `show_spinner(duration=3.0, delay=0.2)` runs the spinner for 3 seconds with a 0.2-second delay between characters.

* **Variables:**
    * `MODE`: A string variable set to 'dev'. It's likely a configuration variable, though not used in the current code logic.

* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**
    * **Error Handling:** The code doesn't include error handling. If there's an issue with the `time` module or any other dependency, an exception could occur without being caught. Consider using a `try-except` block to manage potential errors gracefully.
    * **Readability:** The `show_spinner` function could be made more concise and readable by incorporating a `for` loop over the generator. This might improve its readability.
    * **Flexibility:**  The `MODE` variable isn't used, making it a potential placeholder that might be useful in different configurations.  Consider a more elaborate configuration mechanism for potentially different output behaviours or contexts.


**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

This module (`cursor_spinner.py`) is likely in the `utils` folder of a larger project. It provides a reusable tool that can be imported and used by other modules in the project to indicate loading or processing states.  This positioning demonstrates a common design pattern in Python projects, where utility functions are grouped for easy access and modularity.  The primary interaction is importing this module within other parts of the project.
