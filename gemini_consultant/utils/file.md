    Saves the provided data to a file at the specified file path.

    Args:
        data (str | list | dict): The data to be written to the file. It can be a string, list, or dictionary.
        file_path (str | Path): The full path to the file where the data should be saved.
        mode (str, optional): The file mode for writing, defaults to 'w'. Options include:
            - 'w': Write mode, which overwrites the file.
            - 'a': Append mode, which appends to the file.
        exc_info (bool, optional): If True, logs traceback information in case of an error. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        bool: Returns True if the file is successfully saved, otherwise returns False.

    Example:
        >>> success: bool = save_text_file(data="Hello, World!", file_path="output.txt")

**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **`save_text_file` Enhancement:**  The crucial addition is handling dictionaries.  It now uses `json.dumps` to save dictionaries to files, correctly formatting them and ensuring proper handling of special characters. This is essential if you want to write data like configurations that might contain non-ASCII characters.  The `ensure_ascii=False` prevents problems with non-ASCII characters in the saved JSON.

* **`remove_bom` Improvement:** The `encoding='utf-8-sig'` is added to the `open()` function in the `remove_bom` function. This is a crucial fix.  `utf-8-sig` automatically detects and removes the BOM if present, which is much more robust than manually checking for it. The previous implementation relied on a potential problem with the data encoding.

* **`traverse_directory` Enhancement:**   The `traverse_directory` function now checks if the file extension is `.py` *or* `.txt`. This makes it more versatile and likely to cover more cases.

* **Error Handling:**  The `remove_bom` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch `IOError` exceptions and provide informative error messages.

* **`main` function improvements**:  The `main` function now uses `Path` objects for better path handling, reducing the risk of errors.



**How to use:**

1.  **Save:** Save the corrected code as `file.py` (or any name you prefer) inside the `utils` folder.
2.  **Run:** Execute the script from your terminal using `python file.py`. This will traverse the specified directory and remove BOM characters from all `.py` and `.txt` files.


This revised solution is more robust, handles a wider range of input data, and is significantly less error-prone than previous versions. Remember to replace `'..\\src'` with the actual path to your source directory if it's different. Remember to include the `src.logger` module in your project as well.
