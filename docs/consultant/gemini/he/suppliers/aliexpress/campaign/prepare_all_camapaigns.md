```

**Changes Made**

- Added a docstring to the `prepare_all_campaigns` function, following RST format, to describe its purpose and parameters.
- Replaced `MODE = 'development'` with an empty line as the variable was not used in the code and thus it's assumed the intended purpose is not relevant.
- Added a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions during the process_all_campaigns execution.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` to handle potential errors and log them properly.
- Added a  `# --- Example Usage (uncomment to run) ---` block to show how to run the function.  This is a helpful pattern for testing and demonstration.
- Corrected file name to `prepare_all_campaigns.py` (from `prepare_all_camapaigns.py`).
- Added `import header` to handle any possible import issues with the `header` module.
- Added descriptive comments for all changes.
