**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import necessary modules:** Explicitly imports `TestClient` and `HTTPException`.
* **TestClient:** Uses `TestClient` for making requests to the FastAPI application, which is a better approach for testing FastAPI endpoints.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.
* **Comprehensive Cases:** Tests now cover missing first name, missing last name, and script execution errors.
* **HTTPException Handling:** Properly checks for `HTTPException` with correct status codes.
* **Mock Subprocess (Crucial):** The `test_process_data_script_error` test now uses `patch` to mock the `subprocess.Popen` call.  This is essential because you can't directly test the external script in a unit test.  We simulate the error condition without actually running the external script. This makes the tests more reliable and independent.
* **`pytest.mark.skipif` (Important):** This is added to skip the test on Windows systems. This is because `webbrowser.open` might not work the same way (or at all) on Windows in the context of a unit test, making the test unreliable. 
* **Redirect Check:** The `test_redirect_to_index_html` now accurately tests the redirect behavior.


**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_main.py`).
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_main.py`

**Important Considerations for External Script:**

* **`script.py`:** The provided code assumes the existence of an external `script.py` file.  You need this script to be part of your test suite or be readily accessible by the tests. The tests are now set up so that the tests don't depend on the script in any way for its correctness.


Remember to adjust the file paths (`TEST_FILE`) if needed.  This revised solution is significantly more robust and reliable for testing this FastAPI application. Remember that testing external processes can be tricky; consider how to mock or simulate the external script's output for broader test coverage.
