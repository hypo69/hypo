**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `@patch('builtins.print')` to mock the `print` function. This prevents the test from failing due to uncaught exceptions and allows us to confirm that the expected error messages were logged.


2. **Dummy `Driver`:** A `Driver` class is created for testing. This is necessary because the real `Driver` isn't available during testing. The `get_url` and `execute_locator` methods are stubs, but you should replace them with suitable mock objects if possible.


3. **Fixtures for Data:** `valid_html_file_path` and `invalid_html_file_path` fixtures create and manage temporary files for testing local files. This is cleaner than hardcoding file paths within tests.

4. **Error Handling:** Tests now explicitly check for the return values of `get_url` and the existence of `elements`. The tests also check for assertions that confirm the appropriate error messages (printed via `logger`) were raised.

5. **Comprehensive Cases:** More thorough test cases for the `get_url` function are included now, covering valid and invalid file/URL inputs.

6. **`teardown_module`:** A `teardown_module` function is added to clean up the temporary test file created by `valid_html_file_path`. This is critical to prevent test failures due to stale files.


7. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are made to verify that the correct values are returned, especially for error cases and empty results.


**How to Use:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Replace the placeholder `from src.logger import logger` with the actual import path if your `logger` module is in a different location.
3.  Replace the placeholder `Driver` class with the actual implementation of `Driver` if available.
4.  Run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.

Remember to adapt these tests based on the specifics of the `Driver` class and the expected behavior of the `BS` class.  Add more tests for various locator types, unexpected inputs, and exception cases.  Consider adding more robust fixtures as needed.
