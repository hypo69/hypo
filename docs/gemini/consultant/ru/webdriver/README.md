**Changes Made**

- Added docstrings to `main()` function using RST format.
- Replaced `print` statements with `logger.info` or `logger.error` for logging.
- Added `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions and log them using `logger.exception`.
- Improved error handling by checking the result of each method call and logging appropriate error messages.  
- Removed unnecessary comments.
- Added a more comprehensive module-level docstring.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Added necessary imports for proper exception handling.
