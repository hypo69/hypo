**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the scenario, e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`.

2. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is independent, avoids global state.

3. **Edge Cases and Invalid Input:** Tests now cover the case where the marker files aren't found, which was crucial. A test checks the scenario where no project root structure is present to prevent issues.

4. **Exception Handling:**  No need for `pytest.raises` since the code itself handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` already. The tests now ensure that no exceptions are raised.

5. **Mocking `__file__` and `sys.path`:**  Crucially, the tests now mock `__file__` and `sys.path`.  This is essential for testing the behavior when called from different directories, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.


6. **Temporary Directory Creation:** The code now creates temporary directory structures for testing various situations to prevent interference with existing project files. It creates the necessary folder structure within the temporary directory to properly test the function.


7. **Cleanup:** The temporary directory is removed after each test. This prevents test failures due to leftover files.

8. **Import `json`:** This import was necessary for `json.load`, and it is now included at the beginning of the test file.

9. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests use explicit assertions to ensure correctness.

This revised solution provides comprehensive, isolated, and well-structured tests for `set_project_root` under various scenarios, ensuring that the function correctly determines the project root, even in edge cases or when called from outside the project structure.  Remember to run `pytest` in the same directory as this test file. Remember to adjust the import path to `hypotez.src.gui.header` if necessary.
