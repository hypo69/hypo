# Hypotez Project

## Project Description 
The `hypotez` project involves developing a personal AI assistant capable of performing various tasks, including roles such as insurance agent, real estate agent, sales specialist, HR representative, postal secretary, and more. Each assistant will require separate training for specific tasks, and models will be sold for different types of businesses. The goal is to create an adaptive assistant capable of effectively handling complex tasks without requesting help during operation.

In addition, the `hypotez` project is designed to streamline hypothesis analysis and data analysis. It offers a suite of tools and libraries to facilitate statistical analysis and data visualization, enabling users to efficiently analyze hypotheses and interpret data.

Furthermore, the project includes a parser and scraper designed to gather and process data from various sources. This tool will automate the extraction of relevant information from websites and documents, enabling users to collect data efficiently for analysis. By integrating the parser and scraper into the workflow, the project enhances the ability to obtain timely and accurate data, further supporting the assistant's functionality and decision-making capabilities. Together, these projects aim to enhance productivity and improve decision-making processes in various domains.
