### Example of a `README.md` File for the `endpoints` Module

# `endpoints` Module

The `endpoints` module contains various API implementations for interacting with external services and modules. Each subdirectory represents a separate module with an API implementation for a specific service.

## Module Structure

```
src/endpoints
├── prestashop       # API for integration with the PrestaShop system.
├── advertisement    # API for working with advertising platforms.
├── emil             # API for interacting with the Emil service.
├── hypo69           # API for interacting with the Hypo69 platform.
└── kazarinov        # API for the Kazarinov service.
```

## Module Descriptions

### 1. `prestashop`

This module provides an interface for interacting with the PrestaShop e-commerce system.  It offers methods for managing products, orders, and customers.

**Key Features:**

* **Product Management:** Creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving product details.
* **Order Management:** Retrieving, filtering, and processing order information.
* **Customer Management:** Retrieving and updating customer data.
* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling to gracefully manage potential API issues.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop import PrestashopAPI

# Replace with your credentials
api = PrestashopAPI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", store_url="YOUR_STORE_URL")

try:
    products = api.get_products(limit=10)
    print(products)
except PrestashopAPIError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 2. `advertisement`

This module provides an API for managing advertising campaigns and collecting analytics data from various platforms.

**Key Features:**

* **Campaign Management:** Creating, updating, and deleting advertising campaigns.
* **Analytics Reporting:** Retrieving and processing campaign performance data.
* **Specific Platform Support:**  Handles specific reporting requirements for different advertising platforms (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads).
* **Rate Limiting:** Built-in rate limiting to avoid overloading external APIs.

**Example Usage:** (Illustrative; adjust based on specific API)

```python
from src.endpoints.advertisement import AdvertisementAPI

api = AdvertisementAPI(client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
try:
    campaign_data = api.get_campaign_data("campaign_id")
    print(campaign_data)
except AdvertisementAPIError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```


### 3-5. `emil`, `hypo69`, `kazarinov` (Example for `emil`)

(Similar structure as above, but adapt for `emil`, `hypo69`, and `kazarinov`'s specific methods, error handling, and example usage.)

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Ensure all project dependencies are installed. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Import the required module in your code:

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop import PrestashopAPI
from src.endpoints.advertisement import AdvertisementAPI
```

Then configure the API instance and use the available methods.  **Crucially, provide clear documentation for each method, including parameters, return types, and potential error responses.**

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Adhere to the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding style guide.
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for new functionality and existing methods.  Critically, test for edge cases and error conditions.
3. Include clear and concise docstrings for every function and class.
4.  Leave detailed comments for your changes.
5.  Ensure consistent error handling and documentation across all modules.

For questions or suggestions, contact the repository owner or leave comments in the [Issues](issues).
```

**Improvements:**

* **Detailed Example Usage:**  Included basic example usages for `prestashop` and `advertisement` modules, showing how to create instances, handle errors, and call methods.
* **Specific Error Handling:** Added example error handling blocks to show how to catch and display informative errors.
* **Clearer Feature Descriptions:**  Improved feature descriptions to be more specific and actionable.
* **Documentation Emphasis:** Highlighted the importance of comprehensive docstrings and clear error handling.
* **Module-Specific Example:** The example for `emil` (and other modules) now acts as a placeholder and shows how the format should be adapted.
* **Import Statements:** Improved import statements to demonstrate the correct way to import from a module.


This revised README is more comprehensive and provides clearer guidance on using the `endpoints` module. Remember to tailor the example usages and error handling to the specifics of each API. Remember to replace placeholders like `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with actual values. Remember to create appropriate `APIError` exceptions for each module.  Crucially, the `requirements.txt` should contain all necessary dependencies for all the endpoints' APIs.
