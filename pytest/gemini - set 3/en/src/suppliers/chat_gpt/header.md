```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.fixture` for Data:** Introduced fixtures (`mock_settings_json`, `mock_readme_md`) to create temporary files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`) for testing. This isolates tests and avoids modifying the actual project files.
* **Mocking `gs` module:**  Patched the `gs` module to correctly simulate file paths when running tests, avoiding the need to create a dummy `gs.py` file and ensuring that the tests are independent.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added tests for valid input (multiple marker files, file in subdirectory, in the same directory), no marker file, exception handling, and README loading.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing, which is a more robust approach than simple `assert`.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive, indicating the input/expected behavior.
* **Correct Path Handling:** Tests now accurately handle the paths by either using the temporary directory provided by `tmp_path` fixture or creating `settings.json` and `README.MD` inside the project directory.
* **`__root__` Handling:** Added tests that explicitly handle cases where `__root__` isn't in `sys.path` and cases where files are at the top level.
* **Edge Cases:** Includes tests for the case where the settings file or README.MD is missing.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Place the test code in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as the `header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution provides a complete and robust test suite for the `header.py` code, addressing potential errors and edge cases. Remember to adapt the `PROJECT_ROOT` constant if your project structure differs. Also, ensure that `gs` is a module in the correct path within your project.
