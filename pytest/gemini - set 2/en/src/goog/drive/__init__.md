**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `GoogleDrive`:**  Crucially, the code now uses a `MockGoogleDrive` class.  This is essential for testing because you don't have access to the actual Google Drive API.  The `MockGoogleDrive` simulates the `GoogleDrive` class's behavior, allowing you to control its responses.

2. **Fixtures:** A `@pytest.fixture` for `google_drive` is created. This allows for easy access to the mock object in the test functions.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
   - `test_get_drive_files_success`: Tests a successful call.
   - `test_get_drive_files_empty`: Tests an empty response.
   - `test_get_drive_files_exception`: Tests handling of exceptions during the API call.
   - `test_get_drive_files_invalid_response`: Tests a case where the response format is unexpected.
   - `test_get_drive_files_specific_exception`: Shows how to test for specific exceptions (`ValueError` in this example), making tests more precise.

4. **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to assert that the expected exception is raised when appropriate. The error messages are now checked for correctness.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific (e.g., checking for the presence of 'name' and 'id' keys in the returned files) for better test coverage.

6. **Example of Using `Mock`:** The example code demonStartes how to create a mock `GoogleDrive` object, making testing easier and more controlled.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2. Save the test code (e.g., `test_drive.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/goog/drive/__init__.py` file.

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_drive.py
   ```


Remember to replace the `MockGoogleDrive` class and its methods with your actual `GoogleDrive` implementation if you have it available for a thorough test.
