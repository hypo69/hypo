      raise  # Re-raise the exception to be handled by the calling code
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked crucial error handling.  The `try...except` block now catches `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, which handles issues like network problems or invalid URLs.  Importantly, it also catches `KeyError`, which is crucial because the GitHub API response might not be in the expected format (e.g., missing `tag_name`).  This is critical for robustness.  The `response.raise_for_status()` call is vital; it checks for bad status codes (like 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error) and raises an exception if one occurs. This stops the program from continuing with potentially incorrect or incomplete data.

2. **Clearer Return Value:** The function now returns `None` if no release is found.  This is better than an empty string or returning `None` without also raising an exception.  The `try...except` block also allows the calling function to gracefully handle the error if there's a problem with the request or API response. The previous `return` without a value was a serious error; now it raises an exception.

3. **Logging:**  The `logger.error` call is used to log the error for debugging, making it much easier to diagnose issues.  This is a best practice for production code.

4. **Explicit Exception Raising:** The `raise` statement in the `except` blocks ensures that the error is propagated back up to the caller so it can be handled. The previous `return` without a `raise` statement is highly problematic, as it silently ignores the error and returns None, leading to potential unexpected behavior elsewhere in your application.

5. **Informative Error Messages:** The `KeyError` now includes a helpful message showing which key is missing, giving you a specific error in the case the response is malformed.  It logs the whole response to aid debugging.


**How to use it:**

```python
from hypotez.src.check_release import check_latest_release

try:
    latest_version = check_latest_release("hypotez", "hypotez-app")
    if latest_version:
        print(f"The latest release version is: {latest_version}")
    else:
        print("No release found or error occurred.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This revised example demonstrates a far more robust and reliable way to check for GitHub releases, crucial for any production-level code.  The `try...except` block ensures that your code doesn't crash if there's an issue with the GitHub API or network connectivity. The detailed error handling makes it much easier to debug any issues that arise. Remember to install the `requests` library if you haven't already: `pip install requests`. Also, ensure `src.logger` is correctly defined and available.
