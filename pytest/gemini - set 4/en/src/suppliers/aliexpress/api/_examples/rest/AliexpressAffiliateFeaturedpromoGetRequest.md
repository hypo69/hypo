**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_getapiname_valid`).

2. **Valid Input Test:** A test is added to verify that `getapiname()` returns the expected API name.

3. **`__init__` Test:** A test for the `__init__` method checks if the instance variables are properly initialized with the provided values or default values, if any.

4. **Edge Case/Invalid Input Considerations:** The code lacks explicit input validation.  Therefore, the tests now focus on confirming that the `__init__` method does not raise exceptions or change its behavior when passed valid input arguments and the absence of explicit error handling is demonStarted via this example.

5. **Missing Parent Call (Crucial):**  A critical test `test_init_no_parent_call` now shows how to catch the `AttributeError` if the `__init__` of the parent class (`RestApi`) isn't properly called in the subclass. This is crucial for inheritance to function correctly.

6. **Conciseness:** Tests are made as straightforward as possible while still being comprehensive.

7. **`pytest.raises` (not needed currently):** Since the current code doesn't have any exception-raising functionality that we are testing, I removed the `pytest.raises` calls.  It's better to use them only when testing expected exceptions.

**Important Note:**  To make the tests more comprehensive and robust, you'll need to add more tests if the underlying `RestApi` class has parameters that are validated or potentially raises exceptions.  The provided test covers the basic function for `AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoGetRequest` and potential issues with the inheritance mechanism in Python.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_aliexpress_api.py`) in the same directory as the `AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoGetRequest.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_aliexpress_api.py`
