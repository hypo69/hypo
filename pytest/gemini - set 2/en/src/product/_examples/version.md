```python

def test_version_string():
    """Tests if __version__ is a string."""
    assert isinstance(__version__, str), f"Expected __version__ to be a string, but got {type(__version__)}"


def test_version_valid_format():
    """Tests if the version string is in a valid format."""
    # Check if the version string contains only digits and dots.
    # This is a basic check and might not be exhaustive for all versioning schemes.
    assert all(char.isdigit() or char == '.' for char in __version__), \
        f"Version string {__version__} contains invalid characters"

# Example of testing for edge cases (if applicable):
# This example would fail if __version__ was, e.g., "3.12.0"
def test_version_contains_all_digits_and_dots():
    assert all(c.isdigit() or c == '.' for c in __version__), "Version contains non-digit or non-dot characters"

# Example test for exception handling (if applicable)
#  This test assumes there is a function that might raise an exception.
#  If no such function exists, remove this test.
#
# @pytest.mark.parametrize("invalid_input", [123, None, []])
# def test_function_with_invalid_input(invalid_input):
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):  # or another exception type as needed
#         #  Call the function with the invalid input here.
#         # Example: result = my_function(invalid_input)
#         pass
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the purpose (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_valid_format`).

2. **Comprehensive Checks:** The tests now check the type of `__version__` and the format (containing only digits and dots). This covers the core validation of the version string.

3. **Edge Cases:** The example `test_version_contains_all_digits_and_dots` demonstrates how to test edge cases. This test was added to show how one would verify version format consistency using pytest.

4. **Correct Error Handling (Example):** The commented-out example (`test_function_with_invalid_input`) demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling.  If your actual code has a function that might raise exceptions, you'd add a test case like this to validate that it's handling those exceptions correctly.

5. **Docstrings:**  Each test function now has a docstring explaining its purpose.

6. **Removed Unnecessary Comments:**  Redundant comments have been removed.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2. Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`


**Important Considerations:**

* **Actual Function Testing:** The provided Python code only defines a `__version__` constant.  If there were functions or methods in the file, these tests should be written to thoroughly check their behavior with valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs.
* **Versioning Standard:** If the versioning follows a specific standard (e.g., semantic versioning), add tests to validate that standard.
* **Error Handling:** If the code you are testing might raise exceptions, use `pytest.raises` to validate that the exception is handled correctly. Add error handling test cases as needed based on the actual functions.
* **Data-Driven Tests:** Consider using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test functions with multiple inputs more efficiently if appropriate.


This improved solution gives a more thorough and appropriate set of tests for the given, simple Python code snippet. Remember to adapt these tests based on the actual functions and behaviors in the `version.py` file.
