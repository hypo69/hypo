## Functions

### `process_all_campaigns`

**Description**: This function orchestrates the process of checking and potentially creating AliExpress affiliate campaigns. It likely interacts with other modules (`header`, `process_all_campaigns`) to accomplish this.


**Raises**:
- No specific exceptions are documented in the provided code.  The `process_all_campaigns` function from the imported module should have its own exception documentation.  This documentation is critical to understanding potential issues.
```
```python
# Example of what the imported process_all_campaigns function definition might look like.
# This would be necessary to properly document the function in the final Markdown.
from typing import Optional

def process_all_campaigns() -> None:
