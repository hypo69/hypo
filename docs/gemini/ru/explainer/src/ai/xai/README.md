# xAI API Client

## Overview

This repository contains a Python client for interacting with the xAI API. The client is designed to simplify the process of making requests to the xAI API, including both standard and streaming requests.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Securely authenticate your requests using your xAI API key.
- **Chat Completion**: Generate responses from the xAI models using the `chat_completion` method.
- **Streaming Responses**: Stream responses from the xAI models using the `stream_chat_completion` method.

## Installation

To use this client, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### Initialization

First, initialize the `XAI` class with your API key:

```python
from xai import XAI

api_key = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key
xai = XAI(api_key)
```

### Chat Completion

To generate a response from the xAI model, use the `chat_completion` method:

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the answer to life and universe?"
    }
]

completion_response = xai.chat_completion(messages)
print("Non-streaming response:", completion_response)
```

### Streaming Chat Completion

To stream responses from the xAI model, use the `stream_chat_completion` method:

```python
stream_response = xai.stream_chat_completion(messages)
print("Streaming response:")
for line in stream_response:
    if line.strip():
        print(json.loads(line))
```

## Example

Here is a complete example of how to use the `XAI` client:

```python
import json
from xai import XAI

api_key = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key
xai = XAI(api_key)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the answer to life and universe?"
    }
]

# Non-streaming request
completion_response = xai.chat_completion(messages)
print("Non-streaming response:", completion_response)

# Streaming request
stream_response = xai.stream_chat_completion(messages)
print("Streaming response:")
for line in stream_response:
    if line.strip():
        print(json.loads(line))
```

## <algorithm>

This code describes a client for interacting with the xAI API. The algorithm involves:

1. **Initialization:** The `XAI` class is instantiated with an API key.  This step sets up the connection details. (Example: `xai = XAI(api_key)`)
2. **Chat Completion (non-streaming):** The `chat_completion` method takes a list of messages (`messages`) and sends a request to the xAI API to generate a response.  The response is then returned as a JSON string. (Example: `completion_response = xai.chat_completion(messages)`)
3. **Streaming Chat Completion:** The `stream_chat_completion` method takes the same input as `chat_completion`, but it streams the response.  Each line in the stream is a JSON fragment. It processes each line and prints the decoded JSON representation. (Example: `for line in stream_response: ...`)

graph TD
    A[Initialization] --> B{Chat Completion};
    B --> C[Request to xAI API];
    C --> D[Response from xAI API];
    D --> E[Return Response];
    A --> F{Streaming Chat Completion};
    F --> G[Request to xAI API (Streaming)];
    G --> H[Streaming Response];
    H --> I[Process Each Line];
    I --> J[Print Decoded JSON];
```

        G --> H[Streaming Data];
        H --> I[Process Each Line];
        I --> J[Print Decoded JSON];
    end

```

## <explanation>

- **Imports:**
    - `json`: Used for parsing JSON responses from the xAI API, essential for interpreting the streaming data.
    - `xai`: This is a crucial import, assumed to be a module within the project (`src.xai`), containing the `XAI` class for interacting with the xAI API.  Details about this class are further explained below.

- **Classes:**
    - `XAI`: This class likely handles the communication with the xAI API. Its role is to abstract away the details of making requests and handling responses.  Key methods should include `chat_completion` and `stream_chat_completion`, to perform the respective API requests. The `__init__` method takes the API key for authentication.

- **Functions:**
    - `chat_completion(messages)`: Takes a list of messages (JSON-like objects describing the chat context) as input, sends a non-streaming API request, and returns the API's response as a string.
    - `stream_chat_completion(messages)`:  Takes the same input as `chat_completion` but streams the response, allowing for real-time display.  This method likely handles iterating through the response and returning each line as a JSON object.

- **Variables:**
    - `api_key`: Stores the API key, crucial for authentication with the xAI API.  Should be treated as sensitive data.
    - `messages`: A list of dictionaries, each representing a message in the chat exchange, used for both non-streaming and streaming requests.  These messages are structured to conform to the expected format by the xAI API.


- **Possible Improvements:**
    - Error handling:  The code lacks error handling (e.g., checking for incorrect API responses, network issues).  Including `try...except` blocks is vital.
    - Input validation: Ensuring `messages` is in the correct format could prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Rate limiting: The code doesn't implement rate limiting for the API. The client should consider adding logic to prevent overloading the API endpoint.
    - API key security: Handling the `api_key` securely (e.g., environment variables, secure storage) is critical for production use.
    - Logging:  Implementing basic logging would help with debugging and monitoring.

**Relationship to other parts of the project:**

The `xai` module, likely part of a larger project, is responsible for interacting with the xAI API. This code is a crucial component for using the API, acting as the client layer within the project's architecture. Other parts of the project could include:
* **`src.models`**:  Potentially defining chat models, or any other data structures or logic involved in how the messages (`messages`) list is constructed.
* **`src.data`**:   Handling data required for context management or for processing any intermediate data obtained from the API requests.


This analysis provides a better understanding of the code's functionality and its position within the broader project.
