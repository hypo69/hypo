# Changes Made

- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (or `j_loads_ns`) from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Corrected import paths for `tinytroupe` and related modules.
- Added RST-style docstrings to functions (`test_story_start`, `test_story_start_2`, `test_story_continuation`).
- Improved error handling; use `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except` for better error reporting and clarity.  Avoid unnecessary `...` (added more context).
- Added a `world.run(2)` call in `test_story_continuation` to simulate world activity, which was missing in the original code. It might help for a more realistic testing behavior.
- Corrected proposition assertion message for better readability.
