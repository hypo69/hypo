**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`temp_project_dir` Fixture:**  This fixture is crucial for creating a controlled testing environment. It creates a temporary directory with the necessary files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `settings.json`, `README.MD`) so tests don't rely on your project's actual directory structure.
* **`mock_settings_file` Fixture:** Mocks the settings file and its content for better isolation.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive.
* **Robust Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used for testing `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, ensuring comprehensive error handling is covered.
* **Mocking `gs`:**  Now the `gs` module is mocked to prevent accessing external files during testing. This makes the tests more reliable and self-contained. This is a crucial addition; you shouldn't be reading actual files from a disk in your tests.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  Tests now cover scenarios where files are or aren't present, including various conditions with valid and invalid files.
* **`assert root_path == temp_project_dir`:**  Correctly checks that the root path returned is the one generated by the fixture.
* **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The test cases now cover scenarios like when the marker files are not found, the directory structure is different, or when calling the function in the project's root directory.
* **Relative Path Handling:** Now tests the case where `__file__` is used.


This improved test suite provides more confidence in the correctness and robustness of `set_project_root` and the settings loading logic. Remember to install the necessary libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
