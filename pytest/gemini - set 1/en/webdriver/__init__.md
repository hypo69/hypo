# No specific functionality is visible in the given file beyond class declarations.
# If there were methods in the classes to test, additional, more meaningful
# tests would be required.  For example:

# def test_driver_method_with_valid_input(example_driver_instance):
#   """Tests a specific method of the Driver class."""
#   # Example using pytest.raises for exception handling
#   with pytest.raises(ValueError):
#       example_driver_instance.invalid_method_call("invalid_input")
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are descriptive, clearly indicating the purpose of each test.

2. **Isolation:** Tests are independent, focusing on individual aspects of the code.

3. **Edge Cases and Exceptions:** Although the provided code doesn't have any methods to test, this example demonstrates the structure for handling edge cases and exceptions.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Shows how to use `pytest.raises` to assert that the expected exceptions are raised when incorrect inputs are provided.

5. **Fixtures (Example):**  Crucially, the example now includes a placeholder comment for how to use fixtures, which would be necessary if the classes had methods that needed setup or data.  A meaningful example of that is entirely absent in the original prompt.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now verify the existence of all classes. This is a minimal set of tests, but is essential to ensure the correct import and definition of these classes.  It's not very *useful*, but it's *important*.

**How to Use Fixtures (Example):**

```python
import pytest
# ... other imports from the module

@pytest.fixture
def example_driver_instance():
    """Creates an instance of the Driver class for testing."""
    return Driver()  # Replace with actual constructor args if needed


# Example usage in a test
def test_driver_method_with_valid_input(example_driver_instance):
    """Tests a specific method of the Driver class."""
    result = example_driver_instance.some_method("valid_input")
    assert result == "expected_output"  # Replace with appropriate assertion
```

**Crucial Note:**  The provided code snippet only declares classes.  There are no methods or functions, making it impossible to perform meaningful testing.  If you add example functionality to the file, you'll get more complete test cases from this template. This significantly improves the test coverage and helps prevent bugs.


**Running the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_webdriver.py`).
2.  Ensure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_webdriver.py`
