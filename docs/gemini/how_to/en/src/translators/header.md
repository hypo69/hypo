**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing or invalid. This prevents the script from crashing.  Critically, it prints informative warnings instead of silent failures.  This is *essential* for production code.
* **Explicit Encoding:**  Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function when reading `README.MD`.  This is crucial to correctly handle files that might contain characters outside the ASCII range.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Renamed `__root__` to `root_path` inside the function for better clarity and consistency.
* **Default Values:** Provides sensible default values (`'hypotez'`, `''`) for `project_name`, `version`, etc. when `settings.json` is missing.
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings for clarity and completeness.  I've filled in the :synopsis: parts for more context.
* **Pathlib:** Using `Path` objects consistently is good style and makes the code more readable and less error-prone.
* **Prepending to sys.path:** The `if root_path not in sys.path:` block is now correctly inserting the root path into `sys.path` using `str(root_path)`.


This revised version is much more robust and suitable for real-world use.  It's crucial to anticipate potential errors and handle them gracefully in production code. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you haven't already: `pip install packaging`. Also, remember to have `gs.path` defined and available for the `gs` module to function properly.
