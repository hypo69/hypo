# No functions or classes are present in the provided code to test.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A comment is added explaining this.

# This is a placeholder for tests.  No actual test cases can be created without
# functions/methods/classes to test.
#
# Example:
#
# If you had a function like this:
#
# def calculate_sum(numbers):
#     return sum(numbers)
#
# You could write tests like:
#
# def test_calculate_sum_valid_input():
#     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#     expected_sum = 15
#     assert calculate_sum(numbers) == expected_sum
#
# def test_calculate_sum_empty_input():
#     numbers = []
#     expected_sum = 0
#     assert calculate_sum(numbers) == expected_sum
#
# def test_calculate_sum_with_strings():
#    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         calculate_sum(["a", "b"])


# Placeholder for tests if there were functions to test.
#
# Example:
#
# def test_function_example():
#     # Test code here
#     pass
