```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test is present in the HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A test file cannot be created 
# from only an HTML file.  

# To write meaningful tests, you need Python code that interacts with 
# this HTML file (e.g., a web driver interacting with it, or a function
# that parses the content).  Please provide the Python code that uses/
# interacts with the HTML file.
