**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block.  Crucially, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` that could arise if the project root isn't found, and exits with a clear error message, preventing the script from potentially crashing silently.  This makes the code much more robust.
* **Clearer Error Message:** The error message now indicates *why* the project root wasn't found, providing more actionable information.
* **Explicit `sys.exit(1)`:**  The code now exits the script with an error code (1) after printing the error message. This is a standard practice for indicating failure. This is preferable to simply letting the program crash later, since the user will get a clearer indication of what's wrong.
* **Simplified `get_project_root`:** The logic for finding the project root is simplified.

**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:**  The original code had a critical flaw:  it didn't handle the possibility that the project root wouldn't be found. This could lead to unexpected behavior, or even a crash further down in the script.
* **Maintainability:**  Error handling makes the code more maintainable because it makes the code's purpose clearer and easier to understand. It's easier to debug and maintain when issues are addressed with well-defined error handling.
* **Readability:** The `try...except` block and the more direct error handling makes the logic and intent clearer.


This revised code is much more reliable and user-friendly.  It is a best practice to always handle potential errors in code, especially when dealing with file system interactions, to prevent unexpected or hidden issues later on.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`marker_files`:** Carefully consider the files you are using in `marker_files`. This is a core part of how your script finds the project's location, so make sure those files are reliable indicators of where the project *should* be.
* **`sys.path`:** Using `sys.path` can be problematic if the script isn't invoked with the project's root in the `PYTHONPATH`.  You should consider alternatives to explicitly setting `sys.path` if possible.  If you're using a package management system (like pip), those packages will often manage the `PYTHONPATH` correctly.
