# Consider using a mock (e.g., with `unittest.mock`) if testing network calls directly.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes tests for `ValueError` and `TypeError` using `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions when invalid data types or empty strings are provided.  Crucially, it asserts on the *content* of the exception message, making the test more robust.

* **Clear Assertions:** The `assert` statements now clearly specify what the expected result should be.


* **Realistic Data:** Instead of hardcoding credentials, use example valid and invalid credentials.  NEVER hardcode passwords or other sensitive information directly in your tests.

* **Comprehensive Testing:**  The provided examples are a start, but you need many more tests to cover all possible scenarios.  Think about potential problems:
    *   What happens if the login service is unavailable?
    *   What are the different kinds of invalid credentials?
    *   What happens if there are network issues (timeouts, etc.)?

* **Missing `login` function:** The provided code snippet only imports the `login` function.  To run the tests, you need to have the `login` function in the module.  The example tests are now dependent on the existence of the `login` function.


**How to use:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_login.py`).
2.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_aliexpress_login.py
    ```

Remember to replace the placeholder `valid_username`, `valid_password` values with actual (test) data in your test cases.  It's *critical* that you do not hardcode *real* credentials.  Store these securely (e.g., in environment variables) and only use them for the test cases.


```python
# Example implementation of the login function (place this in the same file as your tests or a module it imports)
def login(username, password):
    if not isinstance(username, str) or not isinstance(password, str):
        if not isinstance(username, str):
            raise TypeError("Username must be a string")
        if not isinstance(password, str):
            raise TypeError("Password must be a string")

    if username == "" or password == "":
        raise ValueError("Username and password cannot be empty")

    # Simulate login logic (replace with actual login functionality)
    if username == "valid_username" and password == "valid_password":
        return "Login successful"
    else:
        return "Login failed"
```
