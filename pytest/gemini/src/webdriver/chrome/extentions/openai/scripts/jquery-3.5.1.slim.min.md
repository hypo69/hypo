**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `jquery_3_5_1`:**  Crucially, you need to import the jQuery code.  If it's a `.js` file, you can use `import jquery_3_5_1` only if you've processed it into a Python module (e.g., using a JavaScript to Python converter or by extracting the necessary functions).

2. **Replace Placeholders:** The example tests are placeholders.  You need to replace the `...` parts with actual calls to the functions and assertions based on their expected behavior.  Critically, you need to *understand* the jQuery library's code to write meaningful tests.

3. **Testing Specific Functions:** The added tests (`test_jquery_extend_valid_input`, `test_jquery_extend_recursive_object`, etc.) demonstrate how to test specific functions.  Focus on checking the returned value and potential side effects.

4. **Exception Handling:** The example `test_jquery_error_handling` shows a correct way to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.  Important:  jQuery's error handling might throw specific error types. Your tests should catch these types.

5. **Data Structure:** Your tests should have appropriate data structures to match jQuery's internal data.  Example tests were added for `extend`.


**To run these tests:**

1. **Structure:**  Save the jQuery code in a Python file (e.g., `jquery_3_5_1.py`).  It must be valid Python code, likely extracted from a JS-to-Python converter.
2. **Create a `test_jquery.py` file:** Place the provided test functions in a file like `test_jquery.py`.
3. **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
4. **Run pytest:** `pytest test_jquery.py`

**Important Considerations:**

- **JavaScript to Python:** Converting large JavaScript libraries like jQuery to Python can be complex. Consider using a library or tool to extract the relevant functions and data structures.
- **Scope:** The provided jQuery code is extensive. Start by selecting a small section and testing that thoroughly.
- **Mock External Dependencies:**  If the jQuery code interacts with the DOM, network requests, or other external resources, use `pytest`'s mocking capabilities to simulate the interactions for isolation in your tests.

Without the converted Python code corresponding to the jQuery code, these tests are incomplete placeholders. You'll need the Python equivalent of jQuery's functions to make meaningful assertions. Remember to focus on *testing the behavior* of the individual Python functions, and to test both valid inputs and (where appropriate) invalid/exceptional inputs. Remember to add test coverage for edge cases.
