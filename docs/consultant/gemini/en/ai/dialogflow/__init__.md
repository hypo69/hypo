# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python

**Improved Code**:

```python
## \file hypotez/src/ai/dialogflow/__init__.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
""" module: src.ai.dialogflow """
MODE = 'development'

"""
Module for interacting with Dialogflow.

:var MODE: Current mode of operation (development).
"""
```

**Changes Made**:

- Added a complete docstring to the module, explaining its purpose and using reStructuredText format.
- Removed the placeholder comment.  The remaining comment was retained.


**Explanation of Changes**:

The original code had a placeholder comment.  The improved code provides a more informative and structured docstring using reStructuredText formatting, as per the prompt's instructions.  This makes the code more understandable and maintainable.  The `MODE` variable, while not an object, is still documented in the docstring as required.
