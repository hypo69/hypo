```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.kualastyle import MODE, Graber


def test_mode_value():
    """
    Tests that the MODE constant has the correct value.
    """
    assert MODE == 'development'


def test_graber_class_exists():
    """
    Tests that the Graber class exists.
    """
    assert Graber


# No specific methods or functions are defined in the code snippet other than
# constants, so we cannot make meaningful tests for functionality.  We have
# included a test of the Graber class existence, but no further testing is
# possible based on the provided code.  If the file defines more complex
# functions or methods, test cases can be extended to check those.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Limited Testable Code:** The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MODE` and a class `Graber`.  There are no functions or methods within `Graber` to test.  The tests reflect this limitation.

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage (for what exists):**  The `test_mode_value` function checks the value of the `MODE` constant, verifying its assignment.

3. **`test_graber_class_exists`:** Checks if the `Graber` class is defined without needing to instantiate it (as there is no method to call).

4. **Missing Functionality:**  Crucially, there's no functionality to test within the `Graber` class itself (e.g., no methods are defined).  If the code had methods such as `Graber.fetch_data` or `Graber.process_data`, we would be able to create more comprehensive tests, including various input types, error handling, and boundary conditions.  The test would also need to use a `pytest.fixture` to mock the behaviour and avoid external dependancies of the `Graber` class.

5. **Error Handling (where possible):**  If the code raises exceptions under certain conditions (e.g., invalid input to a method), then the `pytest.raises` function would be used to test those exceptions:

```python
import pytest
# ... other imports and tests ...

def test_graber_invalid_input():
    # Assuming Graber has a method like fetch_data
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        invalid_data = "incorrect_input"  # or any invalid type
        graber_instance = Graber()  # or use fixture for graber
        graber_instance.fetch_data(invalid_data)
    assert "Invalid input" in str(excinfo.value)  # specific assertion about the error message
```


To add more robust tests, you'll need to provide the actual functions and methods within `Graber`. Then, we can create comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and exception handling. Remember to add mocks and fixtures as needed to isolate your tests and make them independent of external dependencies.
