**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Replacement:** The code now includes a placeholder for the actual code from `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/errors/__init__.py`.  **You MUST replace this placeholder with the actual code.**  This is absolutely essential for meaningful tests.


2. **Example `MyCustomError`:** A simple `MyCustomError` class is added as an example.  **Replace this with the actual error classes defined in your file.**


3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover:
   - Valid input ( `test_raise_custom_error_valid_input`)
   - Invalid input ( `test_raise_custom_error_invalid_input` )
   - Edge case ( `test_raise_custom_error_edge_case_empty_condition` handling `None` as input which is common for various conditions.)
   - **Exception Handling (crucial):** The `pytest.raises` context manager is used to verify that the correct exceptions are raised with the expected messages when the conditions aren't met.


4. **Type Error Handling:**   A crucial addition is the `test_raise_custom_error_edge_case_empty_condition` which checks for the case when the condition has an unexpected type (integer).  This prevents cryptic errors when the input isn't as expected.

5. **Specific Exception Tests:** Added comments and example test functions to show how you would adapt to test for *specific* exception types defined in your file if they exist (e.g., InvalidInputError). **You MUST add these tests as well if relevant.**


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Replace the placeholder:** Put the actual code from `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/errors/__init__.py` into the placeholder.

2. **Install pytest:** If you don't have pytest installed, run `pip install pytest`.

3. **Save:** Save the Python file (e.g., `test_errors.py`).

4. **Run the tests:** Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and run `pytest test_errors.py`.


**Important:** The tests are tailored to the example code provided. Adapt them to reflect the structure, classes, and exceptions in the actual file you want to test.  Crucially, you need to **replace** the example classes and functions with those from your `aliexpress/api/errors/__init__.py` file.  This is the missing step that would make the tests meaningful. Remember to import the necessary modules to test them.
