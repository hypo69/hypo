```

**Changes Made**

- Added necessary imports (`json`, `j_loads`, `logger`).
- Added a `process_data` function to demonstrate usage.
- Added RST documentation for the function and module.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` as per requirement.
- Added error handling using `try...except` blocks and `logger.error` for better error reporting and compliance with requirement 5.
- Added informative error messages to logs.  
- Improved comments using RST format.
