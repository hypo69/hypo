**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Removed unnecessary comments:** The `...` were removed as they don't contribute to the code's functionality or clarity.
* **Improved import statements:** The code now explicitly imports the necessary modules using their fully qualified names.  This is a best practice to prevent potential naming conflicts and makes the code more readable.   Wildcard imports (`from . import *`) should generally be avoided.
* **Docstrings (optional):** I added comments to illustrate where you could include docstrings for `ProductTranslationsManager` and `CategoryTranslationsManager` if they exist. This helps maintainability.


**Further Considerations (Important):**

* **`__init__.py` Purpose:**  The `__init__.py` file in a Python package is crucial.  It tells Python that the directory is a package. Without this file, the `from .module_name import ...` type of imports will fail.


* **`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`:**  These are likely populated by the `version.py` file. It's a good practice to ensure these variables are correctly populated in `version.py`. You might use a tool like `setuptools` to manage and distribute versions properly.


* **Error Handling:** Consider adding `try...except` blocks around imports in case a dependency isn't found. This is crucial for robust code, especially when dealing with external libraries.


* **Module Structure:** Verify that `product_translations.py` and `category_translations.py` actually exist in the `hypotez/src/db/manager_translations` directory, and that they contain the classes `ProductTranslationsManager` and `CategoryTranslationsManager` respectively.


* **File Naming:** While `manager_translations` is a reasonable name, ensure the modules within that directory (`product_translations.py`, `category_translations.py`, and other modules you may add) have descriptive names consistent with the project's structure.  For example, `product_translations.py` seems appropriate, but it may be worth considering a more specialized name that captures its function better.


* **Code Quality:** Use a linter like `flake8` to check for style consistency and potential issues in your code.  This will help maintain a clean and robust codebase.


By implementing these suggestions, your code will be more readable, robust, and maintainable. Remember to adapt the code based on the specific functionality and structure of your project.
