# Discord Bot Trainer Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to train and interact with a machine learning model through a Discord bot. It details the process of preparing training data, using the training command, monitoring training status, testing the model, and utilizing additional commands for managing data.  It also covers the implementation of a dedicated Q&A command.

## Step-by-Step Training Guide

This section outlines the steps involved in training the model using the Discord bot.


### Step 1: Ensure Bot is Running

Verify the bot is running and logged in.


### Step 2: Invite the Bot to Your Server

Ensure the bot is invited to the relevant Discord server and has the necessary permissions to read and send messages.


### Step 3: Prepare Your Training Data

Prepare your training data either as text or in a file.


#### Training with Text Data

Prepare a string of text data for training.


#### Training with a File

Prepare a file containing the training data. The file should be accessible on your local machine.


### Step 4: Use the Training Command

Use the `!train` command to initiate the training process.


#### Method 1: Using Text Data Directly

```
!train "Your training data here" positive=True
```

#### Method 2: Uploading a File

1. Attach the training data file to a message.
2. Send a message containing the command:
   ```
   !train positive=True
   ```


### Step 5: Monitor Training

The bot will respond with a message indicating the training status and a job ID:

```
Model training started. Job ID: <job_id>
```


### Step 6: Verify Training Status

Add commands to your bot to check the training job status, if needed. This typically involves querying the model object for its status.


### Step 7: Testing the Model

Use the `!test` command to test the trained model with input data.


```
!test {"test_key": "test_value"}
```


### Step 8: Using Additional Commands


#### Archiving Files

```
!archive <directory_path>
```

#### Selecting Dataset

```
!select_dataset <path_to_dir_positive> positive=True
```


## Training with Text Data

Details on training the model using text data.


## Training with a File

Details on training the model using a file.


## Monitoring Training Status

Details on monitoring the training process.


## Testing the Model

Details on testing the model with the `!test` command.


## Additional Commands

Description of additional commands like `!archive` and `!select_dataset`.


## Guide to Adding a Q&A Command

Steps for adding a command to allow users to ask questions and receive answers.


### Step 1: Start the Bot


### Step 2: Ask a Question

Use the `!ask` command to prompt the model:

```
!ask What is the capital of France?
```


### Step 3: Receive the Response

The bot will respond with the model's answer:


```
Model response: The capital of France is Paris.
```
