<input code>
```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. **Import:** The code starts by importing the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.  
   * Example: Importing `calculate_sum` from a hypothetical `calculator.py` located in `src/utils/`
2. **Function Definition:** A function named `add_numbers` is defined, which takes two arguments: `a` and `b`.
   * Example: `add_numbers(3, 5)`
3. **Calculation:** Inside the `add_numbers` function, the `calculate_sum` function is called with the arguments `a` and `b`. The result of this calculation is stored in the variable `result`.
   * Example: `calculate_sum(3, 5)` which returns the sum `8`.
4. **Return Value:** The function returns the value of the `result` variable.
   * Example: Returning `8` from `add_numbers(3, 5)`.

<explanation>
**Imports:**

- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator.py` residing in the `src/utils/` directory within the `hypotez` project.  This suggests the `hypotez` project has a modular structure, with `utils` containing supporting modules like `calculator`.

**Function `add_numbers`:**

- **Purpose:** The `add_numbers` function simply adds two numbers together. It encapsulates this functionality by leveraging the pre-existing `calculate_sum` function, which is assumed to handle the actual arithmetic calculation.
- **Arguments:**
    - `a`: The first number to be added.
    - `b`: The second number to be added.
- **Return Value:** The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

**Relationship with Other Packages:**

- The `add_numbers` function relies on the `src.utils.calculator` module to perform the core addition logic. The exact implementation of `calculate_sum` within that module is not visible in the provided snippet, but this structure implies a well-defined separation of concerns. The `utils` package likely contains various utility functions, improving code organization and reusability.


**Variables:**

- `result`:  A variable of an unspecified type (likely an integer) that stores the sum returned by `calculate_sum`.


**Potential Improvements:**

- **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) would enhance code readability and maintainability, improving early detection of type-related errors.
- **Error Handling:** The `calculate_sum` function is not shown, so it's unknown if it handles potential errors (e.g., non-numeric inputs). Adding error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) would make the code more robust.


**Further Analysis (hypothetical):**

- It's possible `calculate_sum` performs input validation. If it does, `add_numbers` implicitly benefits from this validation. Without the implementation of `calculate_sum`, this is a conjecture.  Examining `src/utils/calculator.py` would reveal the precise implementation details, including error handling.

- The relationship with other parts of the project is limited to the dependency on `calculate_sum`.  To understand broader interactions, more code from other modules would be necessary.
