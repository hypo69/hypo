# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/ai/gemini/header.py`

This file sets up essential environment variables, loads configuration data, and defines metadata for the project. It's crucial for the operation of the project, acting as a foundational piece.

## Key Functions and Variables

### `set_project_root(marker_files=...)`

This function finds the root directory of the project. It starts from the current file's directory and recursively searches upward until it finds a directory containing any of the specified `marker_files`.  These files are typically project-defining files like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`.

**Arguments:**

*   `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names to search for within parent directories.  Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Return Value:**

*   `Path`: The path to the project root directory, or the current directory if no matching root is found. The path is also added to `sys.path`, making modules within the project importable.

**Example Usage (not in the code, but illustrative):**

```python
project_root = set_project_root()
print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
```


### `config`

This variable is a dictionary containing project configuration loaded from `src/config.json`.

**Loading:**

The script tries to load this JSON file. If successful, it populates the `config` variable.  If the file is not found or not valid JSON, `config` remains `None`.


### `__root__`

A `Path` object representing the project root directory. It's populated by the `set_project_root` function.


### `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__coffee__`

These variables store project metadata. They're initialized from the `config` dictionary (if available) or default values. They're designed for use in documentation, versioning, and project metadata.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions when reading `config.json` and `README.MD`.  This is crucial for robustness.
*   **`gs.path.root`:** The code leverages a `gs.path` object.  The `gs.path` module is likely responsible for manipulating paths related to the project's structure (e.g., project root). You should refer to documentation for the module `gs`.  It appears to contain utility functions for working with paths within the project.
*   **`MODE`:** The `MODE` variable, set to 'dev', suggests different behaviors might be triggered depending on this mode.


## How to Use

1.  **Project Structure:** Ensure your project directory structure matches the expected paths (e.g., `src/config.json`, `src/README.MD`).
2.  **Configuration:** Populate `src/config.json` with relevant project information (project name, version, author, etc.).
3.  **Import and Use:** Import the `header.py` file in your other Python modules. The metadata (e.g., `__project_name__`, `__version__`) will be available for use.
