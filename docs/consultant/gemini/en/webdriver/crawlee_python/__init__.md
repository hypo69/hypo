# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
This module provides initialization and access to the CrawleePython class.
"""
MODE = 'development'

from src.webdriver.crawlee_python.crawlee_python import CrawleePython
#from .crawlee_python import CrawleePython # Original import, removed for clarity and consistency with other files.


```

**Changes Made**

- **Import Correction:** Corrected the import statement from `from .crawlee_python import CrawleePython` to `from src.webdriver.crawlee_python.crawlee_python import CrawleePython`. This makes the import more explicit and follows the naming convention used in other files.  The original import was relative, which is not ideal for maintainability.
- **Module Documentation Enhancement:** Added a docstring to the module to better describe its purpose.  This follows RST standards for Sphinx documentation generation.
