How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a variable `MODE` with the string value 'dev'.  It's likely part of a larger Discord bot project and sets a mode (e.g., development, production) that can be used elsewhere in the code to control various behaviours or configurations.  The use of comments `"""Docstring"""` suggests that this file is part of a larger project with well-documented components.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a single variable named `MODE`.
2. The variable `MODE` is assigned the string value 'dev'.
3. Several multiline strings (docstrings) are included, providing information about the module and its context. The content of these docstrings is not used by the code itself in this example. The content may be used in documentation tools.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Accessing the mode in another part of the code
    import hypotez.src.bots.discord as discord_bot

    current_mode = discord_bot.MODE
    print(f"Current mode: {current_mode}")
