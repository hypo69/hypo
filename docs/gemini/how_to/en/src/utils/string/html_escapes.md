This Python file, `html_escapes.py`, defines a dictionary mapping UTF-8 characters to their corresponding HTML entity escapes.  It's designed to be used for converting special characters into their HTML representations, preventing display issues in web pages.

**How to use `html_escapes`:**

1. **Import the module:**

```python
import html_escapes
```

2. **Access the dictionary:**

```python
html_entities = html_escapes.html_escapes
```

This gives you a dictionary where keys are the UTF-8 characters and values are their HTML entity equivalents.

3. **Convert a character to its HTML entity:**

```python
character_to_escape = '©'
html_entity = html_entities.get(character_to_escape)

if html_entity:
  print(f"The HTML entity for '{character_to_escape}' is: {html_entity}")
else:
  print(f"'{character_to_escape}' not found in the mapping.")
```

This example retrieves the HTML entity for the copyright symbol (©) and prints it.

4. **Converting a string:**

To convert an entire string, iterate through the characters and replace them using `.get()`:

```python
input_string = "This string contains © and < characters."
output_string = ""
for char in input_string:
    escaped_char = html_entities.get(char)
    output_string += escaped_char if escaped_char else char
print(output_string)
```

This code iterates through each character in `input_string`.  If a corresponding HTML entity is found, it's used; otherwise, the original character is kept.  This way you can convert the whole string without losing any characters that don't have mappings.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `.get()` method is crucial.  It returns `None` if a character isn't in the `html_escapes` dictionary. The example code handles this by checking for `None`. This prevents your script from crashing if you try to convert a character not present in the dictionary.

* **Efficiency:** For large strings, consider using a `str.translate()` for efficiency, although the `for` loop example is generally more readable for understanding the process.

* **Character Sets:** Make sure the characters in your strings are correctly encoded in UTF-8 to avoid issues when accessing them and converting them.
