How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines variables related to a project's configuration, likely for a package or application named "hypotez." It attempts to load configuration data from a `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory.  If the file is not found or the JSON is invalid, it defaults to using placeholder values. The code retrieves values for project name, version, documentation, details, author, copyright, and a coffee link, all potentially from the loaded settings.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports the `json` library for handling JSON files.
2. **Initialize `settings` dictionary:** A variable `settings` is initialized as `None`.
3. **Attempt to load settings from `settings.json`:** The code tries to open and load the `settings.json` file using `json.load()`.
   - If the file exists and contains valid JSON, it populates the `settings` dictionary with the loaded data.
   - If the file is not found or the JSON is invalid, it handles the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions with an empty `...` block.  This means no error is raised; the code simply proceeds without loading any settings.
4. **Retrieve configuration values:** The code uses the `settings.get()` method to retrieve values from the `settings` dictionary, providing default values if the key is not found.
   - If `settings` is not `None` (i.e., it was successfully loaded): `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`, are assigned values from `settings`.
   - If `settings` is `None` (no valid settings file): Default values are used for all these variables.
5. **Define `__doc__` and `__details__`:**  These variables are assigned empty strings.
6. **Return configuration variables:** The code implicitly returns the defined variables for the project.



Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.ai.helicone.version import __project_name__, __version__

    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Version: {__version__}")
