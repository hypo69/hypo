**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `MockBrowser` to mock the browser interactions. This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the functions being tested from the external browser dependencies.  Crucially, it now correctly handles the case where `executeScript` returns `False`.  This was a major deficiency in the previous response.

2. **Comprehensive Testing:** The examples now include tests for `send_to_active_tab`, `send_to_specified_frame` (with both valid and *invalid* `frameId` cases!), and the `collect_popup_state` function.  The `change_context_visible` tests demonstrate how to correctly mock and test this function.  It also includes a placeholder for a more comprehensive test of `showError`, which was missing before.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_send_to_specified_frame_invalid_frameId` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for and verify that `showError` is called when there's an error.  This wasn't present previously, making the tests incomplete.


4. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific and meaningful (e.g., checking for specific keys in the return value from `tabs_sendMessage`).


5. **Mock Element Access:** The `test_change_context_visible` tests mock the DOM elements and their methods. This is necessary for unit testing as the actual elements are not directly accessible in a testing environment.

**How to Run:**

Install pytest:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_popup.py`) and run them:
```bash
pytest test_popup.py
```

**Important Considerations for Real Implementation:**

* **Actual Browser Interactions:** Replace the `MockBrowser` with a proper browser automation library (like Selenium or Playwright) if you need to test against a real browser.  This will require adjusting the test setup.

* **DOM Interactions:** Mocking DOM elements is vital for unit testing.  If you are using a real browser, you need to use a tool that allows you to interact with the page elements (e.g., Selenium's `find_element`, `send_keys`, etc. for browser-based tests).  This was illustrated in the example tests for `changeContextVisible`.

* **Fixture Structure:** The fixture for `mock_browser` is a good start, but you'll likely want more complex fixtures if the functions being tested depend on multiple pieces of data.

* **`fu` and other Dependencies:** The tests do not currently use the external libraries like `fu`.  For real-world testing you would need to mock or include these dependencies in your tests.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** Many parts of the given code are asynchronous (using Promises).  You'll need to use the appropriate mechanisms (e.g., `asyncio` or using the browser automation library's capabilities for dealing with asynchronous code) in your testing framework to handle the asynchronicity effectively.


By implementing these adjustments, you can write much more robust and reliable tests for your JavaScript code. Remember to adapt these examples to the specific details and structure of your codebase. Remember to include tests for other functions in the codebase as well.
