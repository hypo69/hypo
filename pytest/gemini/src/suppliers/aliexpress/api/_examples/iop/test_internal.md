```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  The test names now explicitly describe the purpose (e.g., `test_iop_client_execute_valid_request`, `test_iop_client_execute_invalid_params`).

2. **Exception Handling:**  The `test_iop_client_execute_invalid_params` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check if the expected exception is raised when passing invalid parameters.  This is crucial for robustness.  The `assert` statement is adjusted to check for the expected error message within the exception.  This is a *better* way to validate exception handling than just checking for `True` or `False`.

3. **Valid Request Test:** `test_iop_client_execute_valid_request` now has assertions to verify that the response object has the expected attributes (type, code, message, request_id, body).  Crucially, it's important to adapt these assertions to the actual structure of your `response` object (what does it *actually* contain?)  This example is now more complete, but needs modification to match your specific data output.

4. **Invalid URL Test:** `test_iop_client_execute_invalid_url` demonstrates how to test if the code handles an invalid URL correctly.  It asserts the *error message* and the cause of the exception.

5. **Missing Fixtures:** No fixtures were needed for the supplied code, so they are not included.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as `test_internal.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `internal.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_internal.py` from your terminal.

**Important Considerations for Further Tests:**

*   **Response Validation:**  The provided example lacks specifics on the expected `response` structure and content.  You MUST adapt the assertions in `test_iop_client_execute_valid_request` to match the actual data returned by the API call.
*   **Error Handling:** Add tests for different types of API errors (e.g., network errors, API-specific error codes).  Thoroughly test the error handling mechanism of your `IopClient` class.
*   **Input Validation:** Test different types of `itemId`, `authDO` values (e.g., empty strings, incorrect data types, malformed JSON), and various other expected scenarios (e.g. unexpected HTTP status codes, missing required parameters).
*   **Edge Cases:**  Think about edge cases like very large or very small inputs, or unusual characters.

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with concrete assertions based on the expected behavior of the `IopClient` and `IopRequest` classes and the actual API response you are testing.  These tests should be expanded to thoroughly cover the different possibilities for the API call.
