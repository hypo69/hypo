# Critical Improvement: Check for None/empty strings
if __version__ is None or __version__ == '':
  __version__ = '0.0.0'  # Set a default version

# Improved Error Handling: Return meaningful error message
if __root__ is None:
  raise RuntimeError("Failed to find project root.")
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is a `RuntimeError` if `get_project_root` cannot find a suitable root.  This is essential for robust code; the previous code silently fell back to defaults.  This prevents the script from continuing if it's unable to function correctly.
* **`encoding='utf-8'`:**  Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function.  This is vital in case your `settings.json` file contains non-ASCII characters. Without this, you might encounter encoding errors.
* **Default Version:** Sets a default version `__version__ = '0.0.0'` if `settings.get("version", '')` is `None` or an empty string.  This is critical for preventing errors later in the code.
* **Clearer Error Message:**  The `try...except` block now provides information about why `settings.json` might not have been read successfully,  improving debugging.
* **Explicit `None` Check:** Changed `__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''` to `__version__ = settings.get("version", "")`.  This is more clear and idiomatic Python.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `__version__` instead of `__version__:` for consistency.
* **Docstrings:**  Small improvements to the docstring of the `get_project_root` function to be more descriptive about potential errors.
* **Remove Unnecessary `if settings` Checks:**  Removed redundant checks for `settings` (e.g., in `__project_name__` assignment) as these are now handled by `settings.get()`.

These improvements make the code more robust, maintainable, and informative in case of issues.  Always prioritize good error handling and validation to prevent unexpected behavior. Remember to install the `pathlib` package, but it's likely already included with Python 3.4 or later.


This revised solution is significantly more robust and provides a much more appropriate and proactive approach to error handling and default values.  It prevents the script from proceeding in an undefined state if essential data is missing. Remember to test this thoroughly in various scenarios, including those with incorrect or missing configuration files.
