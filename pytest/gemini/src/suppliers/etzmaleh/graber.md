**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Explicitly import necessary modules, including `unittest.mock` for mocking the `Driver` and `logger` objects, and `pytest`.

2. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the `MockDriver` class now mocks the `execute_locator` method.  This is essential because the original code interacts with the web driver, which you can't directly test. Mocking isolates the test from external dependencies.

3. **Fixtures:**  The `mock_driver` and `graber` fixtures correctly create and provide the necessary mock objects to the tests.

4. **Clearer Test Structure:** The test functions are more focused, demonstrating different use cases with better test names.

5. **Mocking `logger`:** The `mock_logger` fixture mocks the `logger` object, allowing tests to verify logging actions without actually writing to a file or console. This is often necessary for testing code that interacts with external logging libraries or components.

6. **`test_close_popup_decorator`:**  This test, while dealing with a partially commented out decorator, demonstrates the approach to testing a decorator.  You need to replace the mocked driver and logger statements with appropriate assertions.


**To make these tests more comprehensive:**

* **Add Tests for Missing Function:** The placeholder comments in the example highlight where to add tests for other functions that would likely exist inside the `Graber` class but are not included in the given code.
* **Test with Invalid Inputs:** If functions have validation checks or error handling, add test cases that verify their responses to invalid or unexpected inputs.
* **Edge/Boundary Cases:** Identify and test boundary conditions, such as empty lists, extreme values, or very large data sets if applicable.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The provided `@close_pop_up` decorator includes error handling with a `try...except` block.  You should add assertions to test that the error handling works as expected (e.g., verifying if the logger was called in the `except` block).
* **Real Driver:**  For production-quality tests, you wouldn't want to rely on mocks. You might use a dedicated testing framework (e.g., `pytest-selenium`) to run tests against a real browser/webdriver instance in a controlled environment.  This would be crucial for testing the actual interaction with a web browser.


This revised solution addresses the issues and provides a more robust structure for testing the `Graber` class, taking into account the need for mocking dependencies to isolate the tests. Remember to adapt these tests to the actual functions and methods in the `Graber` class that you want to test. Remember to install the necessary libraries (e.g., `pytest`, `pytest-selenium` if you want to use a real driver), using `pip install pytest pytest-selenium`.
