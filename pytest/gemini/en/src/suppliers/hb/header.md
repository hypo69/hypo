**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Robust Testing:** Includes tests for valid inputs, missing marker files, and cases where marker files aren't found, improving test coverage.
* **Error Handling:** Added tests checking that the function handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` appropriately, verifying the error cases.
* **Mocking `gs`:** Added a `@patch` to mock the `gs` module for testing the `settings` loading function, making the tests more isolated and reliable, particularly removing the hardcoding of file paths.
* **Temporary Files:** Uses temporary directories and files to avoid modifying the actual project structure. This is crucial for avoiding unintended side effects and making tests more independent.
* **Fixture for `mock_settings_file`:** A fixture is used to create and manage the temporary settings file, making the testing process cleaner and more organized. It's also critical to remove the mock file after the test to avoid file system pollution.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Improved assertions to check specific values or conditions related to the function's expected behavior.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover a wider range of scenarios, including boundary conditions and potential errors.
* **Clean-up:** Added `shutil.rmtree` to clean up the temporary directory after the tests to avoid file system pollution.

**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

Remember to replace `"./temp_project"` and any other placeholder paths with the actual paths if needed.  Also, install the `packaging` library if you don't have it:
```bash
pip install packaging
```
