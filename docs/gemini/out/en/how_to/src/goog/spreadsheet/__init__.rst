How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a module `src.goog.spreadsheet` for interacting with Google Sheets.  It imports classes for interacting with a spreadsheet, likely using the Google Sheets API. The code sets a `MODE` variable, likely for development or production environments.  Crucially, it imports necessary classes (`SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet`) from submodules. These submodules likely contain the actual implementation details for connecting to and manipulating Google Sheets.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports necessary classes:** The code imports `SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` from submodules within the `src.goog.spreadsheet` package.  These classes handle specific operations on the Google Sheets.
2. **Sets a mode:** The code initializes a global variable `MODE` to the string `'dev'`. This likely designates the current environment as development. This variable can be used to control different behavior in different runtime environments (e.g., whether or not to log data to files, or other configurations).
3. **Defines the module's purpose:** It includes a module docstring explaining the purpose of the module and the platforms it's designed for.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.goog.spreadsheet import SpreadSheet  # Assuming SpreadSheet is what you need
    import os
    # ... other imports ...
    
    # Example, replace with your spreadsheet ID
    spreadsheet_id = os.environ.get('GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID')
    
    if spreadsheet_id:
        try:
            sheet = SpreadSheet(spreadsheet_id)
            #Example to retrieve a sheet's data
            data = sheet.get_data() # Replace get_data with the specific function for retrieval
            print(data) # Print the data, or process it as needed

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    else:
        print("Error: GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID environment variable not set.")

**Explanation of the example:**

This example demonStartes how to use the `SpreadSheet` class (assuming that's the class you need). It retrieves spreadsheet data using the `get_data()` function (replace this with the actual method name if different).  Crucially, it also handles potential errors during the interaction, making the code more robust. Remember to replace `'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID'` with the actual ID of your Google Sheet and to install the necessary Google Sheets API client library.


**Important Considerations:**

* **API credentials:**  You'll need appropriate API credentials (e.g., a service account) and authorization to access Google Sheets. The exact method for handling credentials will depend on the specific implementation of `SpreadSheet`.
* **Error handling:** The provided example demonStartes basic error handling; more sophisticated error handling and logging might be necessary for production use.
* **Dependencies:** Make sure you have the necessary libraries (like the Google Sheets API client) installed.
* **`ReachSpreadsheet`:** The code imports `ReachSpreadsheet`. You'll need to examine the implementation of this class to understand its functionality and how it interacts with `SpreadSheet`.
