```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs`:**  The original code directly imports `gs`, which is likely a module you have defined elsewhere.  To test the `settings` loading part in isolation, we now mock the `gs` module. This is crucial for testing the code without needing a real `gs` module or any files.
* **`settings_file` Fixture:** This fixture now creates a temporary `settings.json` file, making the tests significantly more robust and reusable.
* **`temp_project_root` Fixture:** Similarly, a temporary project root is created, allowing for consistent and controlled test environments.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately apparent.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover more cases, including missing files and edge cases in `set_project_root`.
* **`pytest.raises`:** The code uses `pytest.raises` as requested in the prompt for appropriate exception handling.
* **`tmp_path` from `pytest`: `tmp_path` is correctly imported and utilized for creating temporary directories, conforming to `pytest` fixture naming conventions and ensuring appropriate resource management.**

**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the code above (tests and the header code) in separate Python files (e.g., `test_header.py` and `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/header.py`).

3.  Run pytest from your project's root directory:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```


This revised solution provides a much more robust and testable approach to verifying the `header.py` code. Remember to adapt the `gs` mocking to match your specific `gs` module implementation.  Also, consider adding more complex test cases for `settings_file` loading if you have various JSON structure possibilities.
