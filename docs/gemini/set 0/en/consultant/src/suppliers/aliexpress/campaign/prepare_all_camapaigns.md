Module for preparing AliExpress campaigns.
=========================================================================================

## Changes Made

- Added missing `sys` import.
- Added missing `j_loads` and `logger` imports from appropriate modules.
- Removed unnecessary `header` import as it's not standard or used.
- Corrected the `prepare_all_campaigns()` function name to align with file name.
- Added a docstring to the `prepare_all_campaigns()` function following RST conventions.
- Added `try-except` block with `logger.error` to handle exceptions during campaign preparation, improving error handling.
- Added example usage and `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to allow direct execution.
- Improved module docstring, added synopsis for clarity, and added example usage section.
- Added missing type hints and return type to `prepare_all_campaigns()`.
- Replaced comments with RST format docstrings.
- Changed function name from `process_all_campaigns` to `prepare_all_campaigns` for better consistency.
