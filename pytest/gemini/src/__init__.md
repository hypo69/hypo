**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Import:** The code now imports the `credentials` module correctly.

2. **`test_gs_exists`:**  Crucially, this test checks if `credentials.gs` is defined at all.  This prevents cryptic errors if `gs` is missing or misspelled.

3. **Example Test Variations:**  The example tests demonstrate different approaches (returning a value, instantiating a class, handling exceptions).  **Replace the commented-out examples with the appropriate tests for your actual `gs` function or class.**  You need to know what `gs` does and how it handles different inputs to write accurate tests.

4. **Specific Test Cases:** The placeholder tests are examples; you need to add more specific tests based on the behavior of the `gs` function/class, including:
   - **Input validation:**  Does `gs` accept specific types?  What happens with invalid data?
   - **Error handling:** Does `gs` raise exceptions for specific cases?  Your tests should catch these exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
   - **Edge cases:**  Are there any boundary conditions or unusual input values that `gs` needs to handle?
   - **Expected output:** What data does `gs` return for valid inputs?

5. **Docstrings:** All test functions have docstrings, which is good practice for clarity and maintainability.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_hypotez.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/__init__.py` and `hypotez/src/credentials.py` files.

3.  Run pytest from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_hypotez.py
    ```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments and example tests with the actual tests for your code's functionality.  This is crucial for testing the functionality of your project accurately.
