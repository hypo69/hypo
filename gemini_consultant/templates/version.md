    #  Better to handle this exception gracefully.  Don't just let it silently fail.


__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''

```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the script doesn't crash.  It prints a warning message, which is significantly better than silently failing.  This is essential for production code.

* **Variable Naming:** Python style guides generally prefer lowercase with underscores for variables (e.g., `__version__`).

* **`copyright` Correction:** Fixed a typo in the `__copyright__` variable name from `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.

* **Readability (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary, adding a `print` statement to the `except` block further improves the debugging experience.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "MyAwesomeProject",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, My Company",
  "cofee": "https://www.example.com/donate"
}
```

**How to use:**

This `version.py` file can now be imported into other Python modules in your project:

```python
from hypotez.src.templates import version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
```

This will print the values from the `settings.json` file (if it exists and is valid) or the default values if it's not.   This makes your project's versioning and metadata much more robust and maintainable.

By handling potential errors, the code becomes far more reliable in a real-world scenario. This is a key aspect of robust software development. Remember to place the `settings.json` file in the correct directory relative to `version.py`.
