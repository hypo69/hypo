**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Tests:** The provided tests now directly target the functionality of `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`.
2. **Type Checking:** Tests include checks for the expected data types of the variables.
3. **Edge Case Handling:** Tests for `__doc__` check for an empty string, which is a potential edge case. Tests for `__details__` check that it's not an empty dictionary.
4. **Format Validation:**  A crucial check is added for `__version__` to ensure it's a valid `Version` object using `packaging.version`.  Without this, the test might fail silently in an unexpected way if the `__version__` variable is not properly formatted. 

5. **Example Placeholder:**  Placeholders are included for `test_function_with_valid_input`, etc.  These should be replaced by tests for *actual functions* that are present in the code block you omitted. 


**To use these tests:**

1. **Ensure the code you want to test is in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/__init__.py` and import the necessary modules.**
2. **Replace the example placeholder tests with tests for the functions you need to verify in that file.**
3. **Run `pytest` from your terminal in the directory where you saved the tests.**

**Crucial Note:**  The original code snippet only provided the start of a file.  The provided test suite is significantly improved and now addresses potential problems like `__version__` validation but is incomplete. Without the full code, testing the functions within the file won't be possible; tests are now correctly targeting the provided variables. Add more test functions for any other functions/classes from the full code.
