**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_mode_exists`:** Checks if the `MODE` variable is defined and not None.  Crucially, it checks the *type* of `MODE` to ensure it's a string. This is important for type safety.

2. **`test_mode_is_development`:** Directly asserts that the value of `MODE` is 'development'.

3. **`test_mode_type`:**  Asserts the *type* of `MODE` to be `str`, adding an important level of validation.


4. **`test_mode_not_defined` (commented out):** This test was added to show *how* to test for the *absence* of a variable, but it's not strictly needed in this context because the code *does* define `MODE`.  In a production environment, it's not good practice to rely on the absence of a variable; a more robust approach is to define defaults.

**How to Run the Tests:**

Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_fast_api.py`).  Then, run the tests from your terminal using pytest:

```bash
pytest test_fast_api.py
```

This improved test suite is more robust and comprehensive, ensuring that the `MODE` variable behaves as expected.  It's important to add tests for other file/variable contents as the codebase grows.


**Important Note:**  The `` and similar lines at the top of the input file are shebangs and are related to how the file is executed, but they don't affect the Python *code* that you are testing.  The tests only focus on the Python variables and functions within the `hypotez/src/fast_api/__init__.py` file.
