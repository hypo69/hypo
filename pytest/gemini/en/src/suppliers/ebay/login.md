**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Comments:** The provided code has no actual function definitions, so the test cases are placeholders.  **Crucially, replace these placeholder comments with the actual functions from `login.py`.** This is the step that makes the tests meaningful.

2. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (ValueError in this case).  This is vital for testing robust code.

3. **Descriptive Test Names:** The test names clearly describe the scenario being tested.

4. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The tests now include scenarios like missing username/password, empty strings, and usernames longer than expected, making the test suite more thorough.

5. **Clear Assertions:** The `assert` statements are now more precise, indicating what the test is expecting.  Crucially, it checks if the actual `result` of the function matches the expected `True` or `False` for success/failure.

6. **Specific Error Messages:** The `assert` statement now includes the username and password for better debugging if an unexpected result occurs.  Crucially, the `pytest.raises` captures and verifies the *exact* error message.

**How to Use These Tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Substitute the placeholder comments (`# Assume login returns True or False`) with the actual `login` function from your `hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/login.py` file.

2. **Run the Tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_login.py`) in the same directory as your `login.py` file and run `pytest test_login.py` in your terminal.

3. **Adapt and Extend:** The example tests cover basic scenarios.  Add more tests as needed to cover different valid and invalid inputs, expected exceptions, edge cases, and error conditions within the `login` function.  Look for potential exceptions that the code should handle.  For example, if the `login` function connects to a database, you might have network connection errors to consider.


This improved response provides a much more robust and practical way to test your `login` function using `pytest`. Remember to adapt the tests to the actual structure and functionality of your `login.py` file. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
