**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Uses `pytest.fixture` to create temporary directories and files (`tmp_path`) for more controlled and isolated tests.  This is crucial for testing file interactions.  Fixtures `dummy_settings_json` and `dummy_readme` provide controlled data.  Fixtures `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` are used to ensure that the files exist in the specified location.
* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:** Covers various scenarios, including files in different locations (nested folders, parent directory), multiple marker files, cases where the marker files are not present, and paths already in `sys.path`.
* **Robust Settings Loading Tests:** Tests loading success, file not found, and invalid JSON scenarios (using the `tmp_path` fixture). Includes tests using `mock_settings_file`. The tests now check for `None` (the default behaviour when a file is not found).
* **README Loading Tests:** Tests loading success and file not found scenarios for README.MD (using `mock_readme_file`).
* **Clear Assertions:** Uses assertions to validate the expected results (e.g., `assert root_path == tmp_path`).
* **Error Handling:** Correctly handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during file loading. Tests for `None` values as appropriate.
* **Docstrings:**  Added clear docstrings to tests to explain their purpose and inputs.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.  This will automatically find and run all tests within the `test_header.py` file.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive set of tests, crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the `header.py` code. Remember to replace placeholders like `"settings.json"` and `"README.MD"` with the actual file names in your project.  If you need to simulate specific error conditions during the json decode, you can use more tailored JSON files. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`) if you don't have them:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
