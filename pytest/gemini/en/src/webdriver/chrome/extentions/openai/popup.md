# Example test for ng-model interaction (requires more context about the AngularJS code)

# Important Note:  Testing AngularJS code with pytest requires a way to run the AngularJS code and interact with its data model.  
#  The above tests only cover the JavaScript functions; to fully test the interaction between the HTML and JavaScript,
# you would need to use a testing framework like Selenium (or similar) to control the browser and interact with the page elements.
#  Additionally, you would need to have a realistic implementation of the data model and AJAX interactions.


```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **JavaScript Conversion:** The code now uses `js2py` to convert the JavaScript code to Python for testing. This is a crucial step as testing JavaScript directly within pytest is not straightforward.  However, the example above only covers a very simple Javascript.

2. **Realistic Placeholders:** The `popup_js_code` is a placeholder. You need to replace it with the actual JavaScript code from your `popup.js` file.


3. **Testing Assumptions:** The provided HTML snippet only shows basic functions.  Real-world JavaScript is far more complex, involving interactions with a browser and potentially an API.

4. **Data Models:**  Important for realistic testing. To truly test data binding and UI updates, you'll need to use an AngularJS or general JavaScript testing framework.

5. **Selenium or Similar:** To fully test the HTML and the way Angular handles the UI (changing the displayed content), you need to use a browser automation tool like Selenium. You'll need Selenium to interact with the DOM, select elements, input data, and validate the results shown on the page.

**Crucially:** The provided HTML is AngularJS, requiring additional steps and tools to interact with the AngularJS components.  This example demonstrates basic testing of JavaScript functions; you will need a much more robust testing approach for a full-featured AngularJS application.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Install `pytest` and `js2py`:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest js2py
   ```

2. **Replace Placeholder:** Substitute the `popup_js_code` with the actual JavaScript from your `popup.js` file.


3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


This revised solution addresses the limitations and provides a more appropriate and complete test framework. Remember to adjust the tests to accurately reflect the actual functionality of your JavaScript code.  Real AngularJS or JavaScript applications are more complex and will need considerably more sophisticated testing frameworks and strategies, potentially involving UI interaction or browser automation. Remember to also account for the specifics of AJAX calls or API interactions, where needed.
