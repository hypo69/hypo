How to use this code block (hypotez/src/logger/header.py)
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It searches upward from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`).  It then adds the root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`). The code also loads project settings from a `settings.json` file and project documentation from a `README.MD` file. Finally, it extracts specific project details like name, version, author, copyright, and a "coffee" link.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules**: The code imports `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging.version` for handling project structure and settings.


2. **Define `set_project_root` function**: This function takes a tuple of file/directory names (`marker_files`) as input. It initializes `__root__` to the current file's parent directory.


3. **Iterate up the directory tree**: It iterates through the current directory and its parent directories until it finds one containing any of the specified marker files.


4. **Update Python path**: If a root directory is found, it adds the path to the `sys.path` list, ensuring modules can be found within the project's folder structure.


5. **Return the root directory**: The function returns the determined root directory path (`__root__`).


6. **Initialize `__root__` variable**: This line calls the `set_project_root` function, storing the returned root directory path in the `__root__` variable.


7. **Import the `gs` module**: This line imports the `gs` module, presumably containing utility functions for project paths.


8. **Attempt to load settings from `settings.json`**: The code tries to open and parse the `settings.json` file in the project's root directory. If successful, it loads the settings into the `settings` variable.  If it fails (e.g., file not found or invalid JSON), it handles the error gracefully with a `...` (do nothing, likely to prevent a crash).


9. **Attempt to load documentation from `README.MD`**: Similar to loading settings, this section tries to load the content of the `README.MD` file into the `doc_str` variable.  If the file is not found or parsing fails, it handles the error.


10. **Extract project details**: The code extracts project details (name, version, author, copyright, coffee link) from the loaded `settings` dictionary or uses default values if the file is missing or data is not found.


11. **Assign values to variables**:  This assigns the extracted project details to variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.).


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have the project structure in place)
    from hypotez.src.logger.header import set_project_root
    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root directory: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    # ... use other variables
