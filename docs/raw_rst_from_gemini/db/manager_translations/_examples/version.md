This module contains version information for the manager_translations/_examples submodule.

- `__version__`: The version string of the module.
- `__name__`: The name of the module.  This will be "__main__" if run directly.
- `__doc__`: The module's docstring.
- `__details__`: Additional details regarding the version or the module.
- `__annotations__`:  (Type) annotations for variables and functions.  Currently empty.
- `__author__`: The author(s) of the module.

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **`__name__`:** The original code had `__name__:str`.  This is incorrect.  `__name__` is a string.  The corrected code sets it to `__name__ = __name__`. This is a placeholder, and is not necessary to maintain the documentation.  It does correctly define the variable.
* **`__doc__`:**  The original docstring was just a comment. The corrected code now provides a meaningful docstring that explains the purpose of the module.
* **`__annotations__`:**  Explicitly defining `__annotations__` as an empty dictionary is good practice, as it clearly indicates the variable is intended to hold type annotations.
* **Docstring Clarity:** The docstring is more informative and clearly explains the purpose of the variables within the module.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** The formatting adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines, including using `__name__ = __name__` for clarity in the corrected code.  The use of Python's built-in `__name__` within the docstrings provides more context to the variables.



This revised code is more robust and informative, making it easier to understand the purpose of the module and the variables it defines.  It also complies with Python best practices (especially PEP 8) and handles the specific aspects of the code as described in the prompt. Remember that in most cases, `__name__` is simply a reference to the currently executing module's name which would be assigned by the Python interpreter.   If you were to call this directly via `python version.py`, then `__name__` would indeed be `"__main__"`.  In a typical import scenario, it is the module's name (e.g., `__main__`, `hypotez.src.db.manager_translations._examples.version`).  If this script is imported, then the variable defined will be the value of `__name__` for that imported module.
