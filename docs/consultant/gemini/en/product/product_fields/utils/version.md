**Changes Made**

- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Added `get_version` function to allow retrieving the version string.
- Added comprehensive RST documentation for the module and `get_version` function.
- Replaced `__version__` variable assignment to `__version__ = 'v1.1'` in compliance with RST guidelines.
- Corrected variable names to be more descriptive.
- Removed unnecessary `#!` directives.
- Added `-> str` type hints for the `get_version` function's return type for better code clarity and maintainability, which is a common practice in modern Python code.
