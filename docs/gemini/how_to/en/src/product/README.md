# How to Use the `product` Module

This guide describes how to use the `product` module for managing product data within the application.

## Overview

The `product` module handles all aspects of product data management, including processing, validation, and field management.  It comprises two key components:

* **`product.py`**: This module manages the core logic for product records, providing methods for creating, updating, and deleting products.  It also enforces business rules to ensure data integrity.

* **`product_fields.py`**: This module focuses on product fields, handling validation, formatting, and management to maintain data consistency.


## Using `product.py`

The `product.py` module provides functions for interacting with product records.  A typical workflow might involve the following steps:

1. **Import necessary functions:**

   ```python
   from product import create_product, update_product, delete_product
   ```

2. **Create a new product:**

   ```python
   new_product_data = {
       'name': 'Example Product',
       'description': 'A description of the product',
       'price': 99.99
   }

   created_product = create_product(new_product_data)

   # Check if the product was created successfully (e.g., check the return value)
   if created_product:
       print(f"Product '{created_product['name']}' created successfully.")
   else:
       print("Error creating product.")
   ```


3. **Update an existing product:**

   ```python
   product_id = 123
   updated_data = {
       'description': 'Updated description'
   }
   
   updated_product = update_product(product_id, updated_data)
   # Handle the updated_product result as above.
   ```

4. **Delete a product:**

   ```python
   product_id = 123
   deleted = delete_product(product_id)
   
   # Check for successful deletion.
   if deleted:
       print(f"Product with id {product_id} deleted.")
   else:
       print(f"Error deleting product with id {product_id}.")
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Always check the return values of functions to handle potential errors (e.g., invalid input, database issues).  The `product.py` functions should ideally return appropriate error messages or codes.
*   **Data Validation:** The `product.py` module is responsible for enforcing business rules. Ensure that the data you provide for creation and updates adheres to these rules.
*   **Data Types:** Ensure that you provide data in the correct format (e.g., numbers for prices, strings for names).  `product_fields.py` will handle validation on these fields.

## Using `product_fields.py`

The `product_fields.py` module should contain the logic for validating, formatting, and managing specific product fields.  Direct interactions with this module might involve functions like `validate_price(price)` or `format_description(description)`.

**Example (Illustrative - actual implementation details depend on your code):**

```python
from product_fields import validate_price

price = 10.99
if validate_price(price):
    print(f"Price '{price}' is valid.")
else:
    print("Invalid price format.")
```


**Note:** This guide assumes a basic structure for the module.  Detailed implementation would require reviewing the actual code of `product.py` and `product_fields.py`.  Error handling and input validation should be included in the real implementation.
