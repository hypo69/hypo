## micromark-core-commonmark

This package provides the core CommonMark constructs for the micromark markdown parser.  It's a crucial component for parsing a wide range of markdown content, including features like headings, lists, blockquotes, and more.


## What is this?

This package defines and implements the essential CommonMark constructs used by micromark.  These constructs represent the underlying structure of CommonMark syntax.


## When should I use this?

You'll typically use this package *indirectly* when you're building a markdown parser that needs the CommonMark features.  Direct usage is generally not necessary unless you're creating custom micromark extensions.


## Install

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (version 16+)**

```bash
npm install micromark-core-commonmark
```

**Deno (with esm.sh)**

```javascript
import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1';
```

**Browsers (with esm.sh)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1?bundle';
</script>
```


## Use

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with other micromark packages to construct the full parsing pipeline.  Example usage with `micromark` is demonstrated elsewhere and isn't included here.

```javascript
// Example (Illustrative, not complete use case)
import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark';

console.log(autolink); // Access the `autolink` construct
```


## API

This package exports various constructs, enabling you to use them within your own extensions.

```javascript
// Example exported constructs
// ... (attention, autolink, blankLine, etc.)
```

Detailed descriptions for each construct (e.g., `autolink`, `headingAtx`) should be available in the source code documentation.

## Types

This package provides TypeScript type definitions.  You can leverage these types for type-safe development.


## Compatibility

This package is compatible with Node.js versions 16 and newer. It's designed to work with micromark version 3.  Check the compatibility notes within the micromark package for further details.


## Security

This package is considered safe.  Security vulnerabilities should be reported to the appropriate channels.


## Contribute

See the `contributing.md` file in the micromark repository for guidelines on how to contribute.

**Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Clarity and Structure:** The original README was overly verbose in its explanations, especially for a core library.  The revised README focuses on explaining *what* the package does and *how* to use it, keeping the technical details more concise.
* **Direct Use Example:** The example use case was simplified to provide a more concrete understanding of the package's purpose without introducing a full parsing example.
* **API Documentation:**  Emphasized that detailed descriptions of exported constructs would be found elsewhere.
* **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated repeated and redundant information, focusing on the core usage of the package.
* **Improved Headers:** Used more appropriate headers and sub-headers for better readability and to clarify the content.
* **Conciseness and Clarity:** The rewritten README is much more focused, providing quick access to the necessary information.


This revised README is significantly better for user onboarding and for a package meant to be used as a component within a larger project. Remember to replace placeholder links (e.g., links to the source code, specific constructs) with the actual references if they exist. Remember to also add badges and any other necessary content.
