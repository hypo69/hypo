**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` object. This is crucial for isolating the `Graber` class's tests from external dependencies like the webdriver.  It's vital for testability and avoids issues related to actual web interactions.
* **Asynchronous Handling:** The `asyncio.run()` is correctly used to run the asynchronous functions within the tests.
* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The tests now have more specific, descriptive names, making them easier to understand and maintain.
* **Error Handling:**  A `test_grab_page_with_exception` test has been added to verify the handling of exceptions raised during the data retrieval process.
* **Edge Case (`test_grab_page_missing_id`):** Added a test case to demonStarte how to handle situations where a necessary field (like `id_product`) might not be present.
* **`ProductFields` Initialization:** The `test_grab_page_valid_input` test correctly initializes `ProductFields` before asserting the results, which was a missing step.
* **Future Results:**  Crucially, the mocked methods are now set to return asyncio.Future objects that can be resolved.  This matches the asynchronous nature of the actual code.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named `test_graber.py` (or similar) in the same directory as `graber.py`.
2.  Make sure `pytest` is installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_graber.py`.

**Important Considerations for Real Tests:**

* **Real Data:**  In the example, the functions are mocked. In real tests, you need to mock the driver's methods and responses to actual data from a web page. You need to have a way to get the necessary data for the function calls in real tests or mock appropriate return values.
* **More Thorough Tests:** Add tests for all the functions called inside `grab_page`, with various valid and invalid inputs.
* **Context and Global Variables:** The tests also need to mock `Context` and global variables to ensure they don't affect the test results in an unexpected way.  Use `MagicMock` to properly mock them.
* **Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive exception handling in your tests to cover all possible error conditions in the Graber class.


Remember to adapt these tests based on the specific logic of your Graber class to produce robust, accurate, and reliable tests.
