**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Direct Import:** Imports `get_relative_path` directly from the specified module, making the tests more robust.

2. **Mock `hypotez` Directory:**  Creates a temporary `hypotez` directory for testing, which ensures that the function works correctly with a directory that exists, rather than relying on `hypotez` directory existing which isn't always guaranteed. Crucial for avoiding false positives.


3. **Exception Handling:** Includes tests for `ValueError` for situations like when the target directory is invalid or nonexistent, and `TypeError` for incorrect input types.  The `pytest.raises` context manager is used correctly to check for the expected exception type and message.

4. **Edge Case:**  Tests the case where the `current_file` and the `target` are the same path. The previous approach could potentially lead to unexpected output and was not clearly tested.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more explicit, confirming both that the returned relative path is correct and that its resolved path points to the expected location.


6. **Cleanup:** The `teardown_module` function is added to remove the temporary `hypotez` directory after the tests are run to prevent problems with subsequent tests or leaving temporary files behind.


7. **`not_absolute` Test**: Added a test case that handles cases where `current_file` is not absolute, verifying error handling in that scenario.


This revised solution addresses potential issues, makes the tests more comprehensive, and improves code clarity and robustness. Remember to run `pytest` in your terminal to execute these tests.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_get_relative_path.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_get_relative_path.py` from your terminal.


This enhanced structure ensures more thorough and reliable testing of the `get_relative_path` function. Remember to adapt the `current_file` path in the tests if the source file location changes.
