Example:
- Input data: `a = 3`, `b = 5`
- `calculate_sum(3, 5)`: Calculates `3 + 5 = 8`
- Output: `8`


<explanation>
**Imports**:
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `src.utils` directory.  This implies that a `calculator` module (likely containing other mathematical utility functions) is part of the project's utility package.

**Function `add_numbers`**:
- **Purpose**: This function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input, calculates their sum using the `calculate_sum` function, and returns the result.
- **Arguments**:
    - `a`: The first number.
    - `b`: The second number. Both are expected to be numeric types, though the `calculator` module might have validation built in.
- **Return Value**: The sum of `a` and `b`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # result will be 8
print(result)
```

**Classes (if any)**:
No classes are defined in the example code.

**Variables**:
- `result`: This variable stores the result of the `calculate_sum` function, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.  Its type depends on the type of return value from `calculate_sum`.  If `calculate_sum` returns an `int`, then `result` will also be an `int`.


**Relationship with other packages**:
The code demonstrates a dependency on the `src.utils.calculator` module.  The function `calculate_sum` is a critical component of how `add_numbers` performs its task.  Understanding the `calculate_sum` function's implementation and potential error handling would complete the understanding of the code's functionality.


**Potential Improvements**:
- **Type Hinting**:  Adding type hints to `add_numbers` (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) would improve code readability and enable static analysis tools to catch potential type-related errors.
- **Error Handling**:  The `calculator` module might need more robust error handling if `calculate_sum` is not able to handle potential inputs.  Consider checking input types and potentially raising exceptions to signal unexpected data.
- **Docstrings**: Adding docstrings to both `add_numbers` and `calculate_sum` (within the `calculator` module) will explain their usage, arguments, and return values, increasing the code's clarity and maintainability.


**Further Analysis Considerations**:
To fully understand the code's context and implications, further analysis of the `src.utils.calculator` module would be required. This might include analyzing the `calculate_sum` function, and any related functions it calls. This will clarify the purpose of the `src.utils` package, and possibly reveal the overall project architecture or system.
