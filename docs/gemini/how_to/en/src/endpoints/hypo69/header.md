How to use the `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/header.py` file

This file sets up the project environment, loads project settings, and defines key metadata for the Hypotez project.  It's crucial for initializing the application.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Project Root:** The script dynamically determines the project's root directory by searching upwards from the current file's location for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  This is essential for correctly resolving relative paths and module imports.
* **Settings File:** Loads settings from `src/settings.json`. This file likely contains configuration parameters for the project.
* **Documentation:** Attempts to load project documentation from `src/README.MD`.  This improves user understanding and accessibility.
* **Metadata:** Extracts project name, version, author, copyright, and optional documentation strings from the settings file, ensuring these values are accessible throughout the project. A default value is provided if the setting file is missing or the parameter is not found.
* **System Path:** Adds the project root to `sys.path`. This allows Python to locate modules within the project's directory structure.

**Usage Steps:**

1. **Ensure `settings.json` and `README.MD` Exist:** Create a `settings.json` file within the `src` folder. The structure of the settings.json file should match the example provided in the output documentation.  If the project documentation is desired, ensure a `README.MD` file exists in the `src` directory.

2. **Import and Use:**  The file can be imported into other modules within the project, and then the project's details will be available via the following variables:
    ```python
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.header import __root__, __project_name__, __version__, __doc__, __details__, __author__, __copyright__, __cofee__

    print(__project_name__)
    ```
   This will print the project's name. You can similarly access other metadata variables.

3. **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors like `FileNotFoundError` (if `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing) and `json.JSONDecodeError` (if `settings.json` is not valid JSON). This prevents the script from crashing if these files are unavailable or corrupted.

**Important Considerations:**

* **`__root__` variable:**  This variable now stores the project's root directory, not just a string. This is safer for use with paths.
* **`set_project_root` function:** This function is crucial for dynamic project root detection.
* **Dependency `packaging`:**  Ensure you have the `packaging` library installed (`pip install packaging`).

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://support.myproject.com/donate"
}
```


This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage the `header.py` file for initializing and accessing project metadata. Remember to adapt the `settings.json` structure and `marker_files` in `set_project_root` to align with your project's specific setup.
