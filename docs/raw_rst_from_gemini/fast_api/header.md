```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling.  If `find_project_root` fails to locate a project root after checking all parent directories, it silently returns the current directory, which is likely incorrect and can lead to import failures.  The corrected code now raises a `ValueError` if the root isn't found, allowing calling code to handle the error appropriately. Critically, it now exits with an error code (1), which is standard practice for indicating a failure.

2. **Clarity and Robustness:** The error message is now more informative, explicitly stating the reason for failure and what needs to be checked.

3. **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring now includes a crucial addition: a return value describing the potential exception. This makes the function's usage clearer to anyone working with it.

**How to Use:**

This `header.py` script should be placed in the `fast_api` directory of your project.  Import it into your main application and it will handle finding the root directory.

```python
# in a file within your project, e.g. app.py
from fast_api.header import __root__
import some_module_in_my_project  # Should work after importing header.py

# Example usage that checks for the root
if __root__:
    # Do something with __root__
    print(f"Project root: {__root__}")
```

**Crucial considerations**

- **`sys.exit(1)`:** This is vital. If the project root cannot be found, it's crucial for the script to exit with an error code so the caller can be notified.
- **Error Handling Design**: Robust scripts always handle unexpected cases like not finding a root.


By incorporating these changes, the `header.py` module becomes more reliable and user-friendly, effectively preventing silent failures and aiding in debugging. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` if your project uses different conventions.  For example, if you use a `.repo` folder instead of `.git`, you would modify this accordingly.
