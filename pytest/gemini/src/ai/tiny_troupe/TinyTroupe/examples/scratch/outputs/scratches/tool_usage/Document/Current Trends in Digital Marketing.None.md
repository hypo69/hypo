**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Functions:**  The original code had no functions to test.  I've created placeholder functions (`analyze_marketing_trends` and `calculate_roi`) that mimic potential logic from the input text.  Replace these with your actual functions if you have them.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive.

3. **Edge Cases and Exception Handling:** Tests now include cases for empty input, invalid input types, and handling `ZeroDivisionError` in the `calculate_roi` function.

4. **`pytest.raises`:**  The `pytest.raises` context manager is used correctly to test for exceptions.

5. **Fixtures (Not Needed):**  No fixtures are needed for these simple functions, so I haven't included them.

6. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover valid inputs, empty inputs, and various exception scenarios, demonstrating better test coverage.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  If you have your actual functions, replace the dummy functions in the test code with your functions.
2. **Run Tests:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_marketing.py`) and run `pytest test_marketing.py` from your terminal.


**Crucial Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **Robust Input Validation:**  Real functions should always have robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure data integrity.
* **Meaningful Test Data:**  For more realistic testing, generate various types of input data, including edge cases, empty values, invalid formats, and potentially even large datasets for performance testing if appropriate.
* **Detailed Error Messages:**  Thoroughly test error messages returned from the functions being tested and ensure they are helpful and informative.
* **External Dependencies (if any):**  If your functions use external libraries or files, include tests that verify correct interaction with those dependencies.
