```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Modules:** Imports `pytest` and the necessary modules (`Path`, `json`, etc.) from the `hypotez` project.


2. **Clear Test Function Names:** Test function names are descriptive (`test_set_project_root_valid_path`, `test_set_project_root_invalid_path`, etc.).


3. **Test Cases:**
   - `test_set_project_root_valid_path`: Creates a temporary directory and files to mimic a valid project structure and asserts that the function correctly identifies the root directory.  **Crucially**, it cleans up the temporary directory to prevent test failures.
   - `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`: Checks if the function returns the correct path when no matching marker files are found (which is an important edge case).  
   - `test_set_project_root_file_not_found`: Simulates a situation where the marker files are not found in the path.
   - `test_set_project_root_root_already_in_path`: Tests the condition where the root directory is already present in `sys.path`.


4. **Using `pytest.raises` (Not Needed Here):**  The provided code doesn't raise exceptions under normal conditions, so `pytest.raises` is not necessary in these tests.


5. **Fixtures (Not Needed Here):** No fixtures are needed for these tests, as they are self-contained and don't require shared data.


6. **Comments:** The code includes comments to explain the logic of each test case.


7. **Error Handling:**  The original code had `try...except` blocks. The tests don't need these, as the tests aren't testing the handling of file errors; the code *should* properly handle file errors itself.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/header.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest` from your terminal.


This improved test suite provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adapt the file paths to your actual project structure if necessary.
