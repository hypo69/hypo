# Changes Made

*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for consistent logging.
*   Added RST docstrings to all functions, methods, and classes, following Sphinx conventions.
*   Removed unnecessary `...` placeholders.
*   Improved error handling. Errors are now logged using `logger.error` instead of `try-except` blocks where possible.  Specific error messages are added.
*   Replaced redundant comments with more concise and descriptive RST docstrings.
*   Corrected variable names for better readability.
*   Added type hints for better code clarity and maintainability.
*   Improved formatting and consistency in the code style.
*   Removed unnecessary comments and clarified logic.
*   Added missing `from typing import Any, Union, List`.
