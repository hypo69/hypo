**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:**  Crucially, the tests now mock `os.getcwd` using `monkeypatch` (or a similar approach). This allows us to control the path returned by `os.getcwd` during testing, which is essential for verifying different scenarios.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test names (`test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`, `test_root_path_calculation_empty_path`) are much more descriptive, indicating the specific condition being tested.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** The tests now explicitly cover the cases where "hypotez" is not found in the path and where the path is empty, making the test suite more robust.

4. **Error Handling (Important):**  The original code lacked error handling.  The tests now properly handle these cases.  The example now demonstrates how to verify that the `append` operation behaves correctly.


5. **Restoration of original state:** The tests now reset the `sys.path` to its initial state after each test run to prevent unintended side effects between test cases (especially important for `sys.path`).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., as `test_header.py`).
2. Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
3. Run the tests: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution provides more comprehensive and reliable tests for the provided code. Remember to replace `/path/to/hypotez` with the actual path to your `hypotez` directory if needed.  Using `monkeypatch` is the preferred way to manipulate the `getcwd` function in pytest.
