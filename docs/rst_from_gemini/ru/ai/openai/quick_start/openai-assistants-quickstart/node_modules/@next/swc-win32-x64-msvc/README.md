# @next/swc-win32-x64-msvc

This is the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc binary for `@next/swc`, version [Version Number].

**Location:** `C:\Users\user\Documents\repos\hypotez\src\ai\openai\quick_start\openai-assistants-quickstart\node_modules\@next\swc-win32-x64-msvc\README.md`

**Role:** doc_creator

**Description:**

This pre-built binary provides the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc architecture of the `@next/swc` compiler.  It's intended for use in Node.js projects requiring this specific compiler architecture for transpilation.

**Usage:**

This binary is typically used automatically by package managers like npm or yarn. You don't directly interact with it.  It should be automatically included as part of the project's build process.


**Dependencies:**

This binary requires Node.js and the `@next/swc` package to function correctly.


**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter problems, ensure you've installed all required packages and that the project's configuration for SWC is correct.  Verify the correctness of the installation steps according to your project's documentation.
