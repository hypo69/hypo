    Represents an affiliate link from AliExpress.

    Attributes:
        promotion_link (str): The actual affiliate link to be used for tracking.
        source_value (str):  Likely a value identifying the source of the affiliate link, e.g., a campaign ID or referral code.
                             This is often crucial for tracking purposes and analyzing marketing effectiveness.

**Usage Guide:**

This code defines a simple class `AffiliateLink` to represent affiliate links from AliExpress.  It's crucial for storing and working with data related to affiliate marketing on AliExpress.  Here's how to use it:

**1. Creating an Affiliate Link Object:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.models.affiliate_link import AffiliateLink

# Example Usage:
affiliate_link = AffiliateLink()
affiliate_link.promotion_link = "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/xyz123.html?aff_id=123"
affiliate_link.source_value = "summer_sale_2024"
```

**Explanation:**

*   The code imports the `AffiliateLink` class from its defined file.
*   A new `AffiliateLink` object is instantiated.
*   The `promotion_link` attribute is set to the actual affiliate link.  **Crucially, this should be a complete, valid URL.**
*   The `source_value` attribute is assigned a value that helps identify the marketing campaign or source of the link. This could be a campaign ID, a referral code, or any other relevant identifier.


**2. Accessing Attributes:**

```python
print(affiliate_link.promotion_link)  # Output: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/xyz123.html?aff_id=123
print(affiliate_link.source_value)    # Output: summer_sale_2024
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Validation:**  In a real-world application, you should add validation to ensure the `promotion_link` is a valid URL and that `source_value` is in a suitable format.  This prevents unexpected errors.
*   **Data Persistence:**  For storing and retrieving affiliate link data, consider using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a suitable data serialization format (e.g., JSON).
*   **Error Handling:**  Add error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to catch potential issues (e.g., invalid URLs).
*   **Context:** This class is best understood within the larger context of your application.  How do you intend to use this information?  Storing data for later analysis?  Sending to an external service?  Understanding the intended use cases will help in defining appropriate attributes and methods.
