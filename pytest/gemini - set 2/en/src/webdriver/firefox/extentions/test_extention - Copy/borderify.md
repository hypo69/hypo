**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **WebDriver Fixture:** The code now includes a `driver` fixture using `pytest.fixture`. This is absolutely crucial for Selenium tests. It creates a Firefox driver, runs the tests, and then quits the driver.  This ensures each test runs in its own clean environment.  The `scope="module"` means the driver is created only once per test suite.

2. **`about:blank`:** The driver now loads `about:blank`.  This is essential.  If the code modifies the page itself (the HTML, not just style), then you have to load a page from which the script can operate.  Running `about:blank` provides an empty page on which the Javascript can operate.

3. **Explicit Exception Handling:** The `test_borderify_alerts_user` function now includes a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential `NoSuchAlertException` if the alert isn't present.  This is more robust than just assuming the alert is there.

4. **Edge Case Testing (`test_borderify_no_script_execution`):**  This vital test checks the case where the provided script is empty. This avoids the possibility of silently failing when the script isn't correct.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager geckodriver
    ```

2.  Make sure you have `geckodriver` installed and in your PATH.  You can download it from the GeckoDriver website.

3.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_borderify.py`).

4.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_borderify.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The provided JavaScript code doesn't have error handling.  Tests should check for errors.
* **Context:** These tests assume the JavaScript code is intended to be used in a context where a browser page is available via the WebDriver.
* **Real-World Scenarios:**  In a real application, the JavaScript code might interact with elements on the page, potentially requiring waits for elements to be available. The provided tests do not address this.  More realistic tests might involve finding elements on the page, taking actions on them, and verifying the results.


This improved solution provides a more robust and realistic test suite. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific requirements and functionality of the actual JavaScript code you are testing. Remember to install the necessary packages and have the driver available in your environment.  The structure is much better for a real-world test scenario.
