How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  It then initializes the `sys.path` to include this root directory, making modules importable from the project's subdirectories.  It also attempts to load settings from `settings.json` and project documentation from `README.MD`.  Finally, it assigns project-related metadata (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a coffee link) to constants.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a function `set_project_root` that takes a tuple of marker files as input.
2. It starts from the directory containing the current file (`__file__`).
3. It iteratively checks each parent directory for the existence of any marker file specified in the input tuple.
4. If a directory contains at least one of the marker files, the function updates `__root__` with the path of the parent directory.
5. It ensures that the root directory is added to the `sys.path` to make modules accessible.
6. It returns the found root directory.
7. The code calls `set_project_root()` to find the project root, storing the result in the `__root__` variable.
8. It tries to load settings from the `settings.json` file located in the project's `src` directory. If the file is not found or the JSON is invalid, it handles the exception.
9. It tries to load documentation from the `README.MD` file located in the project's `src` directory. If the file is not found or is not correctly formatted, it handles the exception.
10. Finally, it assigns project metadata (project name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and coffee link) to constants.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.logger.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage - this assumes you have pyproject.toml in the project root.
    root_directory = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root directory: {root_directory}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
    # ... access other metadata
