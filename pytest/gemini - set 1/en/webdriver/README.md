**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`@pytest.fixture` for WebDriver:** The `driver_instance` fixture now correctly creates and quits the webdriver instance *per test*.  This is crucial for avoiding issues where tests interfere with each other.


2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Added `pytest.raises` for testing `NoSuchElementException` (and other potential exceptions) to ensure the code handles these conditions correctly.


3. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are now more specific and descriptive, checking not just for the success of the method, but also the expected result. For example, `test_get_url` now verifies that the current URL actually matches the intended URL.


4. **Error Handling:** The tests are designed to gracefully handle potential errors and exceptions.


5. **Appropriate Imports:** Added necessary `from src.webdriver import Driver, Chrome`.


6. **`implicitly_wait`:** Added an `implicitly_wait` to the driver initialization to provide some time for elements to load.  This is *crucial* for your tests to work reliably.  Adjust the wait time (10 seconds in this example) as needed to suit your test environment.


7. **Realistic Test Cases:** Included tests for both valid and invalid URLs, which is necessary for a comprehensive test suite.  Crucially, these tests include the expected behavior of an error.


8. **Example test for `find_element`:** DemonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to test for a `NoSuchElementException`.



**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Place your `src/webdriver.py` (containing the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes) in the same directory as the test file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest -v test_webdriver.py  # Or the name of your test file
    ```

Remember to replace `"https://www.example.com"` with a real or mock URL during testing.  If your real application has dynamic content, you may need to adjust the tests to make them reliable.  This includes checking for elements that are loaded later in the page lifecycle.  Also, add more tests for the more complex functionality that is part of your system.
