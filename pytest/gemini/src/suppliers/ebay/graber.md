**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `Driver` object.  This is crucial for isolating the `Graber` class's behavior from the actual WebDriver.  Crucially, the `execute_locator` method is mocked and checked.


* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.


* **Error Handling:** The `test_execute_locator_mock` function now demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions raised by the `execute_locator` method.


* **Comprehensive Testing:** The `test_graber_init` function now tests the expected initial values of attributes and the absence of `Context.locator`.  Crucially the `test_graber_init_with_locator_set` checks if locator isn't set by accident.


* **Missing Method Test:** The `test_missing_method` function now tests whether an AttributeError is raised if a method doesn't exist, which is critical for robust testing.


* **Fixture for Driver:** A `@pytest.fixture` for `mock_driver` provides a more organized and reusable way to create the mock `Driver`.


* **Fixture for Graber:**  A `@pytest.fixture` for `graber` combines the mock driver with the `Graber` class instance, making test setup more concise.


* **Context Handling:** Added tests to check the initial value of the `Context.locator_for_decorator` to ensure that the global Context is properly handled


This improved solution addresses the edge cases, uses `pytest.raises` correctly, and provides a more robust and organized set of tests for the `Graber` class. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`).  You'll also need the `unittest.mock` module which is part of the standard Python library. Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual path to your file, if necessary.
