```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Attribute Checking:**  Tests now explicitly check for the type of each attribute (`__version__`, `__name__`, etc.) to ensure they are of the expected type (e.g., `str`, `dict`). This is important for robustness.

3. **Docstring Checks:** The code now verifies that the docstrings (`__doc__`, `__details__`) are not empty strings.  This provides more reliable validation.

4. **Missing Attribute Handling:** The `test_missing_attributes` function is a crucial addition. It iterates through a list of expected attributes and raises a `pytest.fail` if any are missing. This prevents subtle errors from slipping through.

5. **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):**  While the prompt suggests its use, `pytest.raises` isn't necessary for these tests.  They simply test the existence and type of variables.

6. **Edge Case Consideration (MODE):** The `test_mode` test is added to verify the `MODE` constant.

7. **Type checking:**  The `test_version_type` function is added to check the type of the `__version__` attribute for additional safety.

8. **Empty String Check:** Checks are added for empty strings for the documentation and the author strings.

9. **Robustness:** The addition of `test_missing_attributes` greatly enhances the test suite's robustness.


This revised solution is more thorough, robust, and likely to catch issues that might otherwise go unnoticed, even if the module code appears to be well-formed. Remember to run `pytest` from the directory containing your test file.  The crucial addition of the `test_missing_attributes` function substantially improves test coverage and reliability. Remember to place this test file in a location where `pytest` can find it. This revised solution is more robust in catching potential problems. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/_examples/version.py"` with the correct file path if it's different.
