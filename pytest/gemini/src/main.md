**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `main`:** The code now correctly imports the `main` module.
2. **Testing `script1` and `script2`:** The tests for `script1` and `script2` now are more robust. Instead of trying to check *internal* actions, they verify that calling the functions doesn't raise errors. This is appropriate given the template nature of the code provided.  **Crucially**, if you *do* have specific functionality within `script1` and `script2` (e.g., file operations, calculations), *those* must be tested!  The current template code isn't sufficient for more complex testing.
3. **`show_help` Testing:** The `test_show_help` now uses `StringIO` and `sys.stdout` to capture and assert the help output, making the test much more effective.
4. **Interactive Menu Testing (Important):**  The most critical tests are for `interactive_menu`.  Mocking `input` using `patch` is used so your tests don't require user input to execute. This allows for systematic testing of different user input scenarios.  The tests now cover valid input ("1", "2"), invalid input, and the "exit" command.  Error handling for invalid input is tested properly.
5. **Error Handling:** The `test_interactive_menu_invalid_input` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to verify that the `logger.error` message is displayed as expected when the user enters invalid input.
6. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**   The tests are outside this block to avoid running them accidentally when you import the `main` module directly.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_main.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_main.py` from your terminal.


**Critical Considerations:**

* **Missing Functionality:**  The example code is a template.  Actual testing will depend significantly on what `script1` and `script2` actually do.
* **Mocking `logger`:**  If the logger actually writes to a file or console, you will need to mock the `logger` object (from `src.logger`) as well for thorough testing.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments in `script1` and `script2` with the real logic. This enhanced test suite will provide a much more comprehensive and reliable test coverage.
