```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.webdriver.firefox._pytest.test_firefox import MODE

# Tests for the global MODE variable
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks if the MODE variable is correctly set."""
    assert MODE == 'dev'


# Note: Without further code from the file, it's impossible to write
# meaningful tests for functions. The provided code only defines a
# constant variable.  If there were actual functions or methods in the
# `test_firefox.py` file, we would write tests here.  The tests above
# at least provide a minimal test suite for the present code, which
# verifies that the MODE value is set correctly.


# Example of a test if there were a function (replace with your code)
# def test_example_function(example_data):
#     """Tests a hypothetical function."""
#     # Replace with the function call and assertions
#     result = example_function(example_data)  # Example function
#     assert result == expected_result  # Example assertion
#     # ... more assertions and test cases ...
