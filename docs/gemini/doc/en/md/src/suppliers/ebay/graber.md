# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for grabbing product fields from eBay. It extends the `Grbr` class and provides asynchronous methods for extracting various product details.  It utilizes the `Driver` and `Context` objects for browser interaction and global configuration, respectively.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: The `Graber` class is a subclass of `Grbr` and handles the specific operations of gathering product information from eBay.

**Attributes**:
- `supplier_prefix`: A string representing the supplier, set to 'ebay'.

**Methods**:
- `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`:  Initializes the `Graber` object. Sets the `supplier_prefix` and initializes the parent `Grbr` class. It also sets `Context.locator` to `None`.


- `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`:
    **Description**: Asynchronous function to gather product fields.
    **Parameters**:
      - `driver` (Driver): The driver instance used for browser interaction.
    **Returns**:
      - `ProductFields`: The collected product fields.
    **Implementation Details:**
    - Sets global variable `d` to the input `driver` and to `self.d`.
    - Contains asynchronous nested functions (`fetch_all_data`) to fetch individual product data fields.  Each field is fetched conditionally using `kwards.get()`.  This allows for selective data retrieval. The function calls are commented out, showing the full range of possible data to gather.
    - Returns the `self.fields` object containing the extracted product data.


## Functions


## Global Variables
- `MODE`: A global string variable set to 'dev' for specifying a mode.
- `d`: A global variable intended to store the driver object, and initialized in the `grab_page` method. This is a global variable.

## Notes
The file includes extensive commented-out code blocks showcasing potential data fields that can be extracted. The intended functionality is to allow flexible and selective gathering of product details.  The `@close_pop_up` decorator is not currently used.  The `Context` class has been commented out and its `locator` and `driver` attributes are set within the `Graber` class.
