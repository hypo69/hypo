```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`PROJECT_ROOT` Constant:** The code now uses a `PROJECT_ROOT` constant to represent the path to the project root. This is crucial for making the tests portable; you can easily change the project's location without needing to change the tests.

2. **Mocking `gs.path.root`:** The tests for `settings` loading now use `@patch` to mock the `gs.path.root` to avoid relying on the actual file system for the root path.  **This is critical for unit testing;** you should never directly interact with the file system in your unit tests!

3. **Clearer Exception Handling:** The exception tests now correctly raise the expected exceptions and verify that the code handles them as intended.

4. **File Creation and Removal:** The tests now create temporary files for testing and then remove them to avoid cluttering the file system.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests now cover more aspects, including cases where the marker files aren't found, and cases where the marker file is in a parent directory.

6. **Import Error Handling:** Added a crucial import statement at the top of the file to address potential import issues.

**Important Considerations (and why these aren't included):**

* **`gs` Module:** The tests don't directly test the `gs` module (which is not shown in your provided code).  To test functions using `gs`, you'll need to mock `gs` or use a different approach, like having `gs` imported and mocked in the test file.

* **`sys.path` modification:**  Testing `sys.path` modification is hard because changes made in one test could affect another. If `set_project_root` is crucial to your tests, you might want to modify its implementation to return a path and then have an explicit function to test whether that path was added to `sys.path`.   A simpler test, as shown, is to make sure the function call finishes successfully without errors.

* **Version Checking:** The `packaging.version` import is fine, but if there are tests relying on `Version`, the `Version` object needs to be mocked in those tests to make the tests independent of the version number of the package.

To run these tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Place this test file in a directory that can import the `header.py` file and run it from your terminal using `pytest`.



Remember to adapt the paths (`PROJECT_ROOT`) and import statements if your project structure differs.  This revised answer significantly improves the robustness and maintainability of your tests, and it's the best way to ensure your code works as intended in different scenarios.
