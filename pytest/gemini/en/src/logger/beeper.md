**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names now explicitly indicate the input type (e.g., `test_beep_valid_level_enum`).

2. **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used to test multiple scenarios for various input levels (including invalid ones).

3. **Exception Handling:**  Tests now include checks for `KeyError` (invalid level) and general `Exception` (unspecified errors during sound playback).  Critically, the tests now look for `Exception` rather than relying on a specific error message, which is more robust.

4. **Edge Cases (Duration/Frequency):** Added tests for negative or zero durations and frequencies, testing the exception handling for these invalid inputs.

5. **Import Fixes:** Fixed import statements to directly import from the specified module.

6. **Valid Success Test:** Added a `test_beep_success_level` to ensure the "success" level works correctly.

7. **Mocking (Optional):** For more complex scenarios involving external libraries or system calls, mocking might be necessary to isolate tests.  For this example, it's not needed but the example shows how you would add a mock.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_beeper.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_beeper.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations (and potential improvements):**

*   **Mocking `winsound`:**  For more robust testing, consider mocking the `winsound.Beep` function. This prevents your tests from relying on the operating system's sound capabilities.

*   **Error Handling:** The existing `try...except` block is good, but consider specific error types to make the testing and debugging more precise.

*   **Complete Coverage:**  You should add more tests to cover all levels and possible input types. Consider error cases where you might have issues with missing keys or other inputs in the dictionary, and handle those cases gracefully.


This improved test suite is more thorough and helps ensure the robustness of your code. Remember to run these tests regularly as you develop the `beeper` module. Remember to install the `pytest` package if you haven't already:  `pip install pytest`.
