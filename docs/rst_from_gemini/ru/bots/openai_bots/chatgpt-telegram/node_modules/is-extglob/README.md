This is a good README.md file for the `is-extglob` package.  Here are some suggestions for improvement:

**Improvements:**

* **More concise description:**  The current description ("Returns true if a string has an extglob") is a bit literal.  Try something more user-friendly, like:  "Quickly determine if a string contains an extglob (glob-like pattern) character."

* **Clearer Example Structure:**  Group examples better.  The current "True" and "False" sections are a little confusing.  Separate the examples by the *type* of pattern being tested (e.g., escaped extglobs, basic globs, various extglobs).  Use more descriptive titles or comments within the examples.

* **Expand on "Escaped Extglobs":**  The explanation for escaped extglobs is brief.  Mention *why* escaping is important (e.g., to prevent the extglob from being interpreted).  Show examples of both escaped and unescaped versions for comparison.  It's good to show the difference.

* **Example with empty string**: Consider including an example where the input string is empty. This is important because it often needs to be handled differently in real-world applications.


* **Highlight Key Use Cases:**  Suggest a few common use cases beyond simple checking (e.g., filtering files, handling user-provided input that might contain glob patterns).  This helps users see the practical value.

* **Improved Syntax Highlighting:** While the code blocks are correct,  consider using a more sophisticated syntax highlighter like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) for cleaner visual presentation.


* **Modernize "About" section:** The way the related projects are listed in the "About" section can be slightly improved for better clarity and readability.  For instance, list the projects in a way that highlights their relation to `is-extglob` (e.g., "Related Modules" and a bulleted list with short descriptions for each link).


**Revised Example Structure (Example):**

```js
## Usage

```js
var isExtglob = require('is-extglob');
```

**Basic Extglobs:**

```js
// Returns true for extglob patterns
console.log(isExtglob('?(abc)'));  // Matches a string containing 'abc'
console.log(isExtglob('@(abc)'));  // Matches a string containing 'abc'
console.log(isExtglob('!(abc)'));  // Matches a string not containing 'abc'
console.log(isExtglob('*(abc)'));  // Matches zero or more occurrences of 'abc'
console.log(isExtglob('+(abc)'));  // Matches one or more occurrences of 'abc'
```

**Escaped Extglobs:**

```js
// Returns false for escaped extglob patterns
console.log(isExtglob('\\?(abc)'));  // This now returns false
console.log(isExtglob('\\@(abc)'));  // This now returns false
console.log(isExtglob('\\!(abc)'));  // This now returns false
console.log(isExtglob('\\*(abc)'));  // This now returns false
console.log(isExtglob('\\+(abc)'));  // This now returns false

// Explanation:  The backslash escapes the special characters, preventing them from being interpreted as extglob operators.
```

**Standard Globs (NOT extglobs):**

```js
// Returns false for standard glob patterns (not extglobs)
console.log(isExtglob('foo.js'));
console.log(isExtglob('!foo.js'));
console.log(isExtglob('*.js'));
```


**Additional suggestions:**

* **Error handling:**  Consider adding examples for testing the handling of invalid input (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, non-string values).

* **Comprehensive test suite:**  The quality of the documentation is strongly tied to the test coverage of the library.  Ensure the tests thoroughly cover all edge cases.

By implementing these suggestions, you'll create a more helpful and user-friendly README.  Remember to keep the tone clear, concise, and focused on practical application.
