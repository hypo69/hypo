**Changes Made**:

- Added RST-style docstrings to functions (`spinning_cursor`, `show_spinner`). This includes detailed descriptions, parameters, return types, and examples.
- Added a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during the spinner operation, like KeyboardInterrupt (if the user presses Ctrl+C) and other exceptions.  This is crucial for robustness.
- Improved error handling. The `except` block now catches potential exceptions and prints a user-friendly error message, preventing the program from crashing.
- Added a more informative `sys.exit(1)` statement within the `except` block, which signals an error condition to the calling process.
- Improved example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to be more concise and self-explanatory.  The docstrings clarify the function.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and follows best practices for error handling and docstrings, making it more maintainable. Importantly, the `try...except` block makes the spinner more user-friendly and prevents unexpected termination.
