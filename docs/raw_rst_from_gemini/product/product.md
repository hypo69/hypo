**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Docstring Enhancements:**  Added more informative docstrings.  Specifically:
    * **`get_parent_categories`:** Now includes parameters, return values, and potential errors (using `@raises`).  This makes the function's purpose and usage much clearer.  Critically, it documents the expected data type for `id_category` and raises a `TypeError` if it's not an integer.  Empty list return if input validation fails.
    * **`Product`:**  Added a description of how the class extends functionality of `ProductFields` and `Prestashop`.
* **`__init__`  Placeholder:** Added a placeholder comment in `__init__` to remind you to add initialization logic for your product (e.g., getting product IDs, URLs).  This is crucial for a complete class.
* **Static Method Correctness:** The `@staticmethod` decorator is used correctly, ensuring `get_parent_categories` doesn't need an instance of `Product` to be called.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `TypeError` for `id_category` in `get_parent_categories`.  This is critical for robust code.  Returning an empty list for invalid input prevents unexpected crashes.


**Important considerations:**

* **`gs` and `logger`:** You should define these in your `__init__.py` or elsewhere in your project.
* **`ProductFields` and `Prestashop`:**  Make sure these classes are defined and work correctly.
* **`Category.get_parents`:**  You should also ensure this function exists and handles potential errors appropriately.
* **`kwargs`:** The code now correctly uses `kwargs` in the `__init__` method. This allows the caller to pass additional arguments to the `Product` constructor.

By following these changes, your code is significantly more readable, robust, and maintainable, fulfilling the requirements of a well-documented and usable Python class. Remember to thoroughly test your improved code to ensure all functionalities work as expected. Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the `__init__` method with your specific initialization logic.
