## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/header.py`

This file initializes crucial variables for the project, including the project root directory, settings, and documentation. It's a fundamental part of the project setup, enabling access to essential configurations and information.

**Key Functions and Variables:**

* **`set_project_root(marker_files=...)`:**
    * **Purpose:** Determines the root directory of the project.  It starts at the directory of the current Python script (`__file__`) and searches upwards through parent directories until it finds a directory containing one of the specified `marker_files`.  These markers can be filenames (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) or directories (e.g., `.git`).
    * **How to Use:** This function is called automatically within the file to set the `__root__` variable.  You don't need to call it directly in your code.  Critically, it modifies `sys.path` to include the project root, making it easy to import modules from anywhere within the project structure.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names to locate the project root.
    * **Return Value:**
        * A `Path` object representing the root directory. If no marker files are found in any parent directories, the current directory is returned.
    * **Error Handling:** Does not contain explicit error handling.  If the project directory structure isn't as expected, the function may return the wrong directory or fail to find essential files, which can cause subsequent errors.  Be sure to handle errors in the calling code.


* **`__root__`:**
    * **Purpose:** A `Path` object storing the path to the project root.  A crucial variable for subsequent file operations.  Initialized by `set_project_root()`.
    * **How to Use:** This variable is used to construct paths to other project files.


* **`settings`:**
    * **Purpose:** A dictionary containing project-specific settings loaded from `src/settings.json`.
    * **How to Use:** Access settings using `settings['key']`. For example: `project_name = settings.get('project_name', 'Default Name')`. The `get` method with a default value is a robust way to handle missing keys.
    * **Error Handling:**  Uses a `try...except` block to gracefully handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, which prevents the script from crashing if `settings.json` is not found or isn't valid JSON. This is crucial for robustness.


* **`doc_str`:**
    * **Purpose:** A string containing the project documentation (README) content from `src/README.MD`.
    * **How to Use:** Use the variable directly to access the doc string.
    * **Error Handling:** Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` if the documentation file is not found or invalid.

* **`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:**
    * **Purpose:** These variables are initialized with values from the `settings` dictionary (if available) and default values otherwise. They hold metadata about the project.
    * **How to Use:** These variables are typically used for displaying project information, documentation, and potentially for version control checks.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` which makes the code more robust. Always include proper error handling in your production code.
* **`sys.path` Modification:** The code modifies `sys.path`. Be mindful of how this affects your project's import behavior and potential conflicts with other projects.
* **`gs` Module:** The code uses a `gs` module. Ensure that this module is properly defined and available in your project.


**Best Practices:**

* **Explicit Error Handling:** Always explicitly handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions, providing informative messages to the user.
* **Clear Variable Names:** Use descriptive variable names (`__root__`, `settings`, `doc_str`) to improve code readability.
* **Default Values:** Provide default values using the `get()` method to avoid errors when keys are missing.
* **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for your functions and variables to enhance usability.

This usage guide highlights the core functionality and essential aspects of the file. Remember to adapt and expand on it as the project evolves.
