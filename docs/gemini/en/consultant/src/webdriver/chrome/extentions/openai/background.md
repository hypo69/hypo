# Received Code

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed');
});
```

# Improved Code

```javascript
# Module for OpenAI Model Extension background script.
"""
Background script for the OpenAI Model Interface extension.

This script handles the extension's installation event,
logging a message to the console.
"""

import logging
from src.logger import logger

# Handles the installation event of the extension.
# Logs a message to the console.
# This event occurs when the extension is first installed.
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    # Log the installation event to the console.
    logger.info('OpenAI Model Interface Extension Installed')
});
```

# Changes Made

*   Added a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format to describe the script's purpose.
*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger` to use for logging.
*   Replaced `console.log` with `logger.info` for better logging practices and maintainability.  
*   Added informative comments in RST style to explain the purpose of the code blocks.
