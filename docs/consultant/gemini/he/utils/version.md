# TODO: Consider adding a function to retrieve version details
```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module-level docstring in RST format.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error handling.
- Removed unnecessary shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python`).  These are often not needed in Python modules and might cause issues.
- Added `TODO` for potential future feature improvements.
