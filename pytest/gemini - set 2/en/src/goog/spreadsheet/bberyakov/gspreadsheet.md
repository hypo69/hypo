```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mock Classes:** Introduced `MockSpreadsheet` to mock the `Spreadsheet` class and its methods.  This is crucial for testing `GSpreadsheet` without needing a real Google Sheets connection.  The `MockSpreadsheet` handles creating and returning a list of mocked spreadsheets.

* **`@patch` Decorator:** Used `@patch` to mock the `service_account` function from `gspread`. This isolates the tests from the actual Google Sheets API calls and makes them faster.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test names to better reflect the conditions being tested.

* **Exception Handling:** Added tests for `test_get_by_id_invalid_id` to verify the exception handling for invalid spreadsheet IDs, a critical aspect of real-world code.

* **Empty List Check:** Added `test_get_all_spreadsheets_for_current_account_empty` to explicitly check for an empty list of spreadsheets, demonstrating a complete case.

* **Mocking `print`:** Used `@patch` with `mock_print` to capture and assert that the print statement is actually happening, which is useful because the tests can now be run without any side effects outside of the test suite.

* **`get_project_spreadsheets_dict` test:** Creates a temporary `spreadsheets.json` file for the test to work correctly.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`global_settingspread.py`:**  You need the `Spreadsheet` and `service_account` classes defined in `global_settingspread.py` for this code to work correctly.  Make sure that file exists and contains the correct implementations of those classes.

* **`goog\\spreadsheets.json`:** The `test_get_project_spreadsheets_dict` test requires a dummy `goog\\spreadsheets.json` file in the same directory as your test file.  You'll need to create a file with the necessary JSON structure for this to pass successfully.


This improved solution is more robust and comprehensive, testing edge cases and error conditions effectively without relying on a real Google Sheets account. Remember to install the necessary libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest gspread
```
