How to use the `hypotez/src/ai/openai/__init__.py` module

This module provides access to OpenAI models and translation functionality.

**File:** `hypotez/src/ai/openai/__init__.py`

**Description:**

This Python module initializes the OpenAI functionality. It defines a `MODE` constant and imports necessary classes and functions from submodules.  The shebang lines (`#!`) specify the executable used to run Python scripts, which is useful for setting up environments with specific interpreters.  The docstring provides module-level documentation, including platform support and a synopsis.

**Key components:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely controls the mode of operation, in this case, 'dev'. This variable might be used for conditional logic or to switch between different configurations (like production vs. development).

* **`from .translator import translate`:** Imports the `translate` function from the `translator` submodule.  This function is likely responsible for translating text.

* **`from .model import OpenAIModel`:** Imports the `OpenAIModel` class from the `model` submodule. This class likely handles interactions with OpenAI models.


**How to use:**

To use the `translate` function, you would do the following:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.openai import translate

# Example translation. Replace 'source_text' and 'target_language' with your values.
translated_text = translate('source_text', 'target_language')
print(translated_text)
```

To use the `OpenAIModel` class, you would do the following (assuming you have an API key set up appropriately):

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.openai import OpenAIModel

# Initialize the OpenAI model
model = OpenAIModel()

# Example usage.  Replace 'prompt' with your prompt
response = model.generate_text(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Important considerations:**

* **API Keys:**  The `OpenAIModel` class likely requires an OpenAI API key to function. Make sure you have an API key configured properly in your environment (likely through environment variables or a config file) for the `OpenAIModel` class to work correctly.


* **Error Handling:**  The example code lacks error handling. Robust applications should include `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid API keys) and provide informative error messages to the user.

* **Submodule Structure:** The `translator` and `model` submodules are responsible for the implementation details of translation and model interactions.  You should consult their individual docstrings for usage information if available, or the source code directly.
