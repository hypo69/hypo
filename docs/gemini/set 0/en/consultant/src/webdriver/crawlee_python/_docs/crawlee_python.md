```python

# Changes Made

- Added missing imports: `asyncio`, `List`, `Dict`, `sync_playwright`, `json`, `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`, `logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings for the class, methods, and functions.
- Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks.
- Improved logging messages to provide more context.
- Corrected the import path for `logger`.
- Improved code clarity and formatting.
- Added placeholder data extraction logic in `process_request` to demonstrate how to populate `self.data`.
- Corrected typos and inconsistencies in comments and variable names.

This final code block now includes the complete, improved code, ready to be copied and pasted.  The `...` placeholders are left untouched as stop points for further development or modification.  Crucially, error handling is now robust, logging errors effectively. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`playwright`, `crawlee`, and the `src.utils.jjson` module).
