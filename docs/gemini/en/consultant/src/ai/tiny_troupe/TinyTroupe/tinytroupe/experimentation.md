# Changes Made

*   Added missing `from src.logger import logger` import for error logging.
*   Added `from tinytroupe.world import TinyWorld` import to `Intervention` class.
*   Modified `Intervention` constructor to handle `None` values and to use a list if necessary.
*   Corrected error handling in `check_precondition` and `apply` using `logger.error`.
*   Added a helper function `_get_original_name` in `ABRandomizer` to avoid code duplication.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings in RST format for both classes.  Corrected some typos in the RST docstrings.
*   Added `if i in self.choices` check to `derandomize` and `derandomize_name` methods to prevent `KeyError` when accessing non-existing keys.
*   Ensured that the parameter `blind_name` in the `derandomize_name` method is correctly named in the function signature and docstring.
*   Added detailed error handling using `logger.error` in `Intervention` class for more informative error reporting.
