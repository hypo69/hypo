**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `pytest.mock` (specifically `unittest.mock` which `pytest` uses) to mock dependencies. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing them from interacting with external resources (like the Facebook API or the file system) which are difficult and unreliable to test directly.  For example, `mock_openai_model` mocks the OpenAIModel.

2. **Clearer Fixture:** The `mock_file_structure` fixture now properly sets up the directory structure, significantly improving the testability of `describe_images`.

3. **More Robust Test Cases:** The test cases now have better coverage by mocking file reading and other crucial elements.

4. **Error Handling:** `test_describe_images_invalid_image_path` demonstrates how to test for exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).

5. **Specific Assertions:**  Replace the placeholder comments with assertions that verify the expected behavior (e.g., checking if the correct files were created, if the correct parameters were passed to the `post_message` function). This is where you would write specific checks to see if `describe_images` functions correctly based on the mocked data.

6. **`promote_to_facebook`:**  The test for `promote_to_facebook` is incomplete but demonstrates how to mock the `Driver` and `post_message` classes.

7. **`upload_to_PrestaShop`:**  Added a placeholder test for `upload_to_PrestaShop`.  Crucially, this needs more sophisticated mocking; you need to mock PrestaShop and the product objects, for example, and then write assertions to test the interactions between them.

**How to Run:**

1.  Install pytest:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as `test_emil_design.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as `emil_design.py`.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_emil_design.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Mock `gs` and other external libraries**:  Modify the tests to mock `gs` and other external modules (like the Facebook API or the Google Drive module) so you can control the input and output from your tests.
* **Realistic Mocks**: Try to make your mocks as close as possible to the real objects in your project.  Simulate realistic behavior as closely as you can.
* **Edge Cases**: The most important tests are those that focus on difficult situations, error cases, and boundary conditions (like empty image directories or very large lists of images).
* **Data-Driven Testing**:  Consider using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to create tests with various data inputs and different scenarios.

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual assertions and update the mocks to match the real implementation of the external dependencies and libraries.  Critically, the testing strategy should reflect the code's complexity and the potential ways it might fail or behave unexpectedly.
