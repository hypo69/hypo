**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`js2py`:** The most important change is the use of `js2py`.  This allows you to evaluate the JavaScript code within a Python environment, crucial for testing JavaScript functions with the Python `pytest` framework.  Without this, your tests are meaningless since Python doesn't know how to work with the JavaScript code.

2. **Mocking:** The code now includes a `mock_updateDetailsTable` and `mock_onError` to handle the parts of the JavaScript that would interact with other parts of the `tryxpath` library, which aren't provided by the original prompt or easily possible to test without a real browser environment.   Critically, this allows you to test the specific logic and side-effects within `showAllResults` without relying on external components (which are unavailable in the Python testing environment).

3. **Robust Assertions:**  The assertions now directly target the expected behavior of `showAllResults` (e.g., checking element text content). This is vital.   Just testing that the function didn't raise an exception isn't enough.  You must test the actual effects of calling the function in the specific cases you care about.


4. **Edge Case (`no_context`):** Added a test specifically for the case where `results.context` is `None` to validate proper error handling.

5. **Error Handling:** The test now includes a test for when `updateDetailsTable` might throw an error, catching the exception and ensuring that the mock `onError` handler is used.

6. **`mock_results` Fixture:** Creates a reusable fixture containing mock results to simplify testing.

7. **`makeTextDownloadUrl` and Other Functions:** These functions are not tested directly in this response. The scope of this test focuses on the core functionality of the `showAllResults` function.


**Further Considerations:**

* **More Realistic Mocks:** The mock functions (`mock_updateDetailsTable`, `mock_onError`) are simplified placeholders.  Replace these with more realistic mocks (or better, use `unittest.mock`) to simulate the real behavior of `tryxpath.functions.updateDetailsTable` and `tryxpath.functions.onError`.

* **`makeInfoText` and `makeConvertedInfoText` Testing:**  These functions should also be tested with appropriate assertions to verify the generated text string's content.


This improved solution addresses the critical issues, providing a much more comprehensive and practical approach to testing the JavaScript code using `pytest` and `js2py`. Remember to adapt the assertions to match the specifics of your expected output based on the details contained in the `tryxpath` module. Remember to use more meaningful assertions.
