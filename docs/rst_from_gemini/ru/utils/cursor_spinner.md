    Shows a spinning cursor in the console for a specified duration.

    Args:
        duration (float): The duration (in seconds) for which the spinner should run. Defaults to 5.0 seconds.
        delay (float): The delay (in seconds) between each spin. Defaults to 0.1 seconds.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to `spinning_cursor` and `show_spinner`, explaining parameters, return values, and including useful examples.  Crucially, included a *type hint* for `duration` and `delay` and a `TypeError` for non-numeric input, which is good practice.  The examples in the docstrings are now more useful.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `TypeError` to `show_spinner` to handle cases where `duration` or `delay` are not numeric, preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Default Values:**  Improved the `show_spinner` function to utilize default values for better flexibility.
* **Clarity:** Made the code more readable and understandable, especially with respect to what the function is doing.
* **Example Usage:** Now shows how to use with default values directly, demonstrating the function's intended use and showing how `duration` can be just `1` in the example.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Fixed indentation to match Python style guide and formatted with consistent indentation.
* **Import `sys`:** Explicit import of `sys` is necessary for controlling standard output.

This revised solution is more robust, readable, and follows best practices for Python code.  Remember to save this code as `cursor_spinner.py` in the specified directory.


To use this spinner in your other scripts, you'll import it as you would any other module:

```python
import cursor_spinner

cursor_spinner.show_spinner(duration=2) # Run for 2 seconds
```
