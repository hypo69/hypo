```python
import pytest

# There's no Python code provided to test.  This is a placeholder.
# Replace this with the actual Python code you want tested.
#  Example code:
# def add(a, b):
#     return a + b

# def validate_input(value):
#     if not isinstance(value, int):
#         raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
#     if value < 0:
#         raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
#     return value


# Example test cases (replace with your actual function names and logic)
# @pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [(2, 3, 5), (0, 0, 0), (-1, 1, 0)])
# def test_add_valid_input(a, b, expected):
#     assert add(a, b) == expected


# @pytest.mark.parametrize("value", [1, 2, 3])
# def test_validate_input_positive(value):
#     assert validate_input(value) == value


# @pytest.mark.parametrize("value", [1, 2, 3])
# def test_validate_input_non_negative_int():
#     assert validate_input(2) == 2

# def test_validate_input_negative_raises_ValueError():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         validate_input(-1)
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "Input must be non-negative"


# def test_validate_input_non_integer_raises_TypeError():
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
#         validate_input("a")
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "Input must be an integer"

# This is where you would put the actual tests generated from the prompt.

#NOTE: The above commented-out examples are hypothetical, to provide you with a framework for building *your* tests, based on *your* input code. You need to substitute this with the content of your input code to get meaningful tests.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing Input Code:** The crucial part of generating effective tests is the actual Python code you want to test.  I've included placeholder comments with example functions (`add`, `validate_input`) to demonStarte the structure.  **Replace the placeholder with the actual code you want to test.**

2. **Test Structure:** The provided `pytest` test structure is a template.  Your actual tests need to precisely reflect the functions/methods/classes of the input Python code, with specific test cases for valid input, invalid/unexpected input, and edge cases.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The example includes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.  Crucially, it captures and verifies the *exception message* to ensure the correct error is raised in the code you're testing.

4. **Parameterization (`@pytest.mark.parametrize`):** The commented-out examples show how to use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the same test with multiple sets of inputs. This is highly recommended for efficiency and thoroughness when testing functions with several possible input values.

5. **Fixture Definitions (if needed):**  If your Python code requires fixtures for test data, define them using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator as shown in the example.

6. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Your tests need to anticipate all types of possible inputs and expected behaviorsâ€”from trivial cases to very complex scenarios.


**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Copy the example placeholder code (the commented-out portion) and paste the actual Python code you want to test.**
2. **Review the placeholder tests:**  Modify them to precisely match the functions/methods of the pasted code.
3. **Write tests for different scenarios.** Use `pytest.raises` when the function might raise exceptions for various invalid inputs or edge cases.  Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for efficiency when testing functions with numerous possible inputs.
4. **Run the tests:** Execute the test file using `pytest`.

**Important:** This template focuses on the structure and style of `pytest` tests. The actual test content must accurately reflect the requirements and behaviors of the Python code you're testing. Remember to use descriptive variable names and test names for clarity. Carefully consider all possible input scenarios, edge cases, and potential errors in your test cases.
