```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create temporary project directories (`temp_project_dir`, `valid_project_dir`, `empty_project_dir`).  This isolates the tests and avoids issues where tests modify the global state.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better reflect the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid`).
* **Edge Cases:** Tests now include cases where marker files are not found, when the project directory is empty (only `pyproject.toml`), and when marker files are in nested folders. This is very important for robust testing.
* **Error Handling:** The tests include cases where `settings.json` might be missing or contain invalid JSON.
* **`assert` statements:** The tests use more explicit `assert` statements to verify expected results.
* **System Path Restoration:** Added a crucial step to restore the original `sys.path` after the test. This prevents problems caused by side effects of the function modifying the global state.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added a test for the case where the project root is already present in `sys.path`.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger.py`

This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests that cover various aspects of the `set_project_root` function, addressing potential issues and edge cases. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` with the actual file path if necessary. Remember to adapt the file paths to your project structure. Remember to use a more descriptive name for your test file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
