# hypotez/src/utils/powershell/examples/pprint/header.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/utils/powershell/examples/pprint/header.py`, appears to be a configuration or utility file, likely for use within a larger project related to PowerShell examples and pretty printing.  It defines a global variable `MODE` and imports necessary modules for potential path manipulation and system interactions.

## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A global variable, likely controlling operating modes (e.g., development, production).  Its value is currently set to 'dev'.

## Imports

### `sys`, `os`

**Description**: Standard Python modules for system-level operations, likely including access to system paths and environment variables.

### `pathlib.Path`

**Description**:  Allows for more object-oriented path handling.


## Constants and Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**:  A constant representing the absolute path to the root directory of the project. Calculated from the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`). It's likely used to locate resources or modules within the project.

## Functionality

This file primarily appears to be setup or configuration code, rather than containing complex logic, based on the large number of docstrings which seem to indicate the intention of this file to be used for setting global parameters or paths rather than implementing functionallity.

## Usage Notes

The use of `sys.path.append(__root__)` suggests that the script intends to import modules located relative to the project's root directory.  The script likely needs to be executed from a location within the project's directory structure for the import to work correctly.
