This module contains tools for interacting with the AliExpress API.
Currently, it exposes a function for retrieving product IDs.

**Explanation of Improvements and Rationale:**

* **Docstring Structure:** The previous docstring was just a single line comment.  A proper module docstring using triple quotes (`"""Docstring goes here"""`) is crucial for clarity and maintainability.  The improved docstring describes the module's purpose and what functions/classes it contains.

* **Module Description:** The docstring clearly states that the module is for AliExpress API tools.  This is important context for understanding its role.

* **Function/Class References:** The improved docstring mentions `get_product_id`, indicating that the module offers this functionality. This is vital for someone reading the file to understand what they can use.

* **Readability and Clarity:** The new docstring is significantly more informative and adheres to Python's docstring conventions.


**Example Usage (Hypothetical):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.tools import get_product_id

product_id = get_product_id("some_product_search_term")
print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **`__init__.py` Purpose:** The `__init__.py` file is crucial for making the `tools` directory a Python package. It should import any submodules that the package should export.
* **Docstrings for Functions/Classes:**  You should add docstrings to the `get_product_id` function itself to explain its parameters, return values, and expected behavior. This is essential for comprehensive documentation.

By following these best practices, the `__init__.py` file and the module will become more robust, readable, and helpful for other developers (and yourself in the future!). Remember to also add docstrings to the functions/methods within the `get_product_id.py` file.
