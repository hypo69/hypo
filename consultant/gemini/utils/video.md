Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.

Examples:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')

    >>> get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Key Improvements:**

* **Timeout:** Added a crucial `timeout` parameter to `aiohttp.ClientSession.get`. This prevents the script from hanging indefinitely if the download fails or the server is unresponsive.  Set it to 60 seconds (adjust as needed).
* **Robust Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks now catch more specific exceptions (`aiohttp.ClientError`) to provide better error messages and handle potential HTTP errors during the download.
* **Empty File Check and Deletion:** The code now checks if the downloaded file is empty (`save_path.stat().st_size == 0`) and deletes the empty file if it is, preventing incorrect data from being used later.  This is *critical* to avoid unexpected problems.
* **Return `None` on Failure:**  The function now returns `None` if the download or file operations fail.  This makes the function's usage more explicit about success/failure.
* **Clearer Logging:** The error messages are improved for better debugging.

**How to Run (Important):**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp aiofiles
   ```

2. **Replace Placeholder:** Update the `url` in the `main()` function to the actual video URL you want to download.

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

This revised code is significantly more robust and reliable for handling video downloads and potential issues.  It's crucial to have error handling and checks to prevent unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with network requests and file operations. Remember to install `aiohttp` and `aiofiles`. Remember to replace `"https://example.com/video.mp4"` with a valid video URL.  If there is no valid URL, the code should now produce a more informative error message.
