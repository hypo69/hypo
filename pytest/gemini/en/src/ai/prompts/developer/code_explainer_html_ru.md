**Explanation of the added tests:**

1. **`calculate_sum` tests:**
   - Cover valid integer and float inputs.
   - Include a test case with zero input.
   - Critically, include tests for *invalid* input (non-numbers) using `pytest.raises` to ensure the `TypeError` is caught and handled correctly.

2. **`add_numbers` tests:**
   - Covers valid integer and float inputs.
   - Covers zero input, negative input.
   - Includes tests with *invalid* input,  ensuring the `TypeError` is correctly raised and caught by the `try...except` block within `add_numbers`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  The provided example code for the original Python program was very basic.  If your actual input code is more complex, you'll need to adapt these tests to cover more specific cases (e.g., edge cases, exception handling related to the actual logic of your code).


* **Error Handling:**  The tests now robustly handle cases where `calculate_sum` raises `TypeError`, which is crucial for testing real-world code.


* **Meaningful Assertions:** Replace placeholders (`...`) in the example test cases with appropriate assertions that verify the expected output for each scenario.


This revised solution provides a more comprehensive set of test cases for the given function, covering various inputs, including edge cases and error handling. Remember to replace the example `calculate_sum` and `add_numbers` with your actual code for complete testing. Always use `pytest.raises` when you expect a specific exception. Remember to thoroughly understand the logic of your function before writing comprehensive tests.
