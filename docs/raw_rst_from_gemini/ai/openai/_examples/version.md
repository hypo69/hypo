"""
This module provides version information and documentation for the `src.ai.openai._examples` namespace.

- `__version__`: Holds the version number of the module.
- `__name__`:  The name of the module.  Will be `"__main__"` if run directly.
- `__doc__`: The module's docstring.
- `__details__`:  Provides additional details about the module's version or purpose.  The exact content is unclear from the provided code snippet.
- `__annotations__`:  Contains type annotations for variables and functions.  The content is not defined in the example.
- `__author__`: The author(s) of the module.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **`__name__` Assignment:** The original code lacked an assignment for `__name__`. This is crucial.  If the script were run directly, without importing it, `__name__` would correctly take the value `"__main__"`. Now, it's set to `"version"` for clarity and consistency.
* **`__doc__` Clarification:** The docstring for the module (`__doc__`) is now more informative and complete. It describes the module's purpose.
* **`__details__` Explanation:** The docstring now explains that `__details__` is intended to capture additional information about the module version, not just for the version.
* **`__annotations__` Handling:** Since annotations weren't defined in the example, an empty dictionary (`__annotations__ = {}`) was added for completeness and correctness.
* **Docstring Style:**  Used a more standard multiline docstring format, which is good practice for readability.
* **File Naming:** The code is now suitable for a Python module/file, as it defines a namespace properly and makes it clear for documentation generation.

**How to Use This Module (in a separate script):**

```python
import hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version.__version__)  
print(hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version.__doc__)
```

This will print the version and the docstring, demonstrating the functionality of the `version.py` module.  Remember to adjust the import path if your project structure is different.


This revised version provides a more robust and usable module for version management and documentation within your project. Remember to update the import path in the calling code if the file structure changes.
