**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures to mock the settings.json and README.md files, allowing for controlled tests without relying on actual files in the filesystem.  This is crucial for testing the *loading* portion.
* **Mocking:**  Crucially, used `@patch` to mock the file handling (`open`) function. This allows us to test cases where the files might not be found or have errors without creating real files every time.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better describe the specific scenario being tested (e.g., `test_get_project_root_valid_input`).
* **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where a marker file isn't present, the marker file is in a parent directory, and the function starts in the root directory.
* **File Existence:**  Used `Path.exists()` mocking within `test_readme_loading_success`.  Crucially, the test now verifies that the file *exists* before attempting to open it.
* **Error Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` that check that the code doesn't crash when such errors occur.  Mocking the `open` function makes this easier.
* **`tmp_path`:**  This fixture from pytest is used to create temporary directories for testing file paths more reliably. This is necessary for the `test_get_project_root_*` tests.
* **`Path.cwd()` Mocking:** The `test_settings_loading_*` and `test_readme_loading_*` tests now use `Path.cwd()` mocking to isolate the test.
* **Comprehensive:** The tests cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, missing files, errors in the JSON format, and edge cases in finding the project root.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved test suite is more robust and provides greater confidence that the `get_project_root` and loading functions will behave correctly in different situations. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.webdriver.chrome.header` with the actual path if your code is located elsewhere. Remember to install the necessary `packaging` library (`pip install packaging`).
