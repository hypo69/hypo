**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** The code now correctly imports `MODE` from the `hypotez.src.bots.telegram` module.  This is fundamental for testing that specific module.  Import `TelegramBot` *inside* the `TestTelegramBot` class to properly handle the import.

2. **`TestTelegramBot` Class:** This is a crucial addition.  It allows for better organization and use of `pytest.fixture` for the `TelegramBot` instance (if needed).

3. **`@pytest.fixture` for `bot_instance`:** This fixture creates a mock `TelegramBot` instance.  This is vital because you *cannot* directly instantiate a class inside a test function.  This separates test setup logic from test logic.  Critically, **you must replace the placeholder instantiation with your actual `TelegramBot` instantiation**. This could involve mock objects or loading a dummy configuration if your code expects that.

4. **Clearer Test Cases:** The provided test cases are now placeholders.  You MUST replace the comments `# Replace with...` with the actual methods, expected outputs, and exception types appropriate for your code.

5. **Exception Handling (`test_bot_method_raises_exception`):**  DemonStartes how to test exception handling with `pytest.raises`. You need to replace `"ValueError"` and `"expected error message"` with the actual exception type and message expected by your code.

6. **Modularity:** The structure encourages modular test cases for each class, method or key component in the module.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_telegram_bot.py`) in a directory that's part of your test suite.

2.  **Run pytest:** Open a terminal in that directory and run: `pytest test_telegram_bot.py`


**Critical Next Steps:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:**  Crucially, you must replace the placeholder methods and expected results with the actual methods and assertions in your `TelegramBot` code.
*   **Test `TelegramBot` Constructor:**  Add tests to check the initialization of `TelegramBot` (e.g., testing various arguments).
*   **Mock Dependencies:** If your `TelegramBot` class interacts with other components,  consider mocking those dependencies for isolated tests (using `pytest-mock` or similar).  This is very important for well-structured tests.
*   **Test with Valid Inputs:**  Create test cases for various valid inputs.
*   **Test Edge Cases:**  Identify and test edge cases and boundary conditions that might cause issues (invalid parameters, empty inputs, etc.).


By following these steps, you will create much more robust and complete test cases. Remember to thoroughly document the expected behavior of your code to write appropriate tests for it.
