**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive `MODE` Tests:** The tests now cover both valid and invalid `MODE` values.  Critically, it now uses `pytest.raises` to test for the expected `TypeError` when attempting to assign a non-string value to `MODE`.  This is crucial for robustness.

2. **`pytest.mark.parametrize`:**  Using `parametrize` allows testing multiple inputs in a single function, making tests more concise and efficient.

3. **Graber Class Tests (Example):** Added a `TestGraber` class with a basic example of testing `Graber` instantiation.   **Crucially,** placeholder tests for `test_graber_fetch_data` and `test_graber_handle_error` are included. *You need to replace these placeholders with the actual method tests for the Graber class if it exists and has methods.*

4. **Import Test:** Added a test to verify that the `Graber` class is imported successfully.

5. **Exception Handling (Example):** Added an example of how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions. *Replace the placeholder with your actual exception-handling logic.*


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Fill in the example tests for `Graber` methods and any other functions in your file.
2. **Run Tests:**  Save the test file (e.g., `test_kualastyle.py`) in the same directory as your `kualastyle/__init__.py` file.  Then run `pytest test_kualastyle.py` from your terminal.

This improved example provides a more comprehensive and robust test suite for your `kualastyle` module. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual functions and classes in your code. Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the code with your actual methods and expected behaviors. This enhanced solution is designed to catch potential errors and ensure the code's correctness and reliability. Remember to adapt these tests to fit the specifics of your `Graber` class.
