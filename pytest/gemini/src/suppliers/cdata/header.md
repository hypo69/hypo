```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more precisely describe the scenario being tested.
* **Dummy Data:** The tests now create temporary dummy files ("pyproject.toml," "requirements.txt", ".git") within a new directory to avoid side effects on the real project structure and ensure that the test environment isn't altered. 
* **Error Handling:** Added tests that check for situations where the marker files are not found, thus properly testing edge cases and handling missing files.
* **Independent Tests:**  Each test now creates its own temporary directory. This crucial step ensures that tests are truly isolated and don't interfere with each other's setup.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover various scenarios, including when marker files are present in the current directory, the parent directory, or not present at all,  and with multiple marker files. 
* **Cleanup:**  The code now properly removes the created dummy files after each test, preventing the build-up of files and potential issues. This is crucial for maintainability and prevents tests from interfering with each other.
* **Fixture (NOT NEEDED IN THIS CASE):**  While the example structure mentioned fixtures, the provided code doesn't require them.  Thus, fixtures have been removed in the provided solution.


This revised solution is more robust and demonstrates better test design principles.  Remember to adapt the `__file__` references if you're using this code in a different context. Importantly, the tests now thoroughly handle different file locations, ensuring more comprehensive coverage.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`
