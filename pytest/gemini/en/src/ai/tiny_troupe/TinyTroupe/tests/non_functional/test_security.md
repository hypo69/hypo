```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `openai_utils`:** The original code relied on the actual `openai_utils` module, which isn't suitable for testing. This solution mocks the `openai_utils.client()` method with `MockOpenAIClient`.  This is crucial for isolating the tests.


2. **Fixtures for Mocking:** The `mock_openai_client` fixture now correctly sets up the mock client, so we can control its response in each test case. This is more flexible.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The code now includes test cases for:
   - **Valid response:**  `test_default_llmm_api_valid_response` covers a typical scenario with a properly structured response.
   - **Empty response:** `test_default_llmm_api_empty_response` tests an empty response dict.
   - **`None` response:** `test_default_llmm_api_none_response` tests for a `None` response, demonstrating exception handling.
   - **Invalid response type:** `test_default_llmm_api_invalid_response_type` tests handling of unexpected data types returned by the API.


4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more specific and descriptive.  Crucially, instead of just asserting `next_message is not None`, we now add more specific checks, like `assert "content" in next_message`, to verify the structure of the response.

5. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_default_llmm_api_none_response` and  `test_default_llmm_api_invalid_response_type` cases use `pytest.raises` to properly test for exceptions.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and effective set of tests that can validate the core functionality of the `test_default_llmm_api` function without relying on external APIs. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`. Also, ensure that the `testing_utils` module is properly set up.


Now, running `pytest` will execute these tests against the mocked `openai_utils` and provide more thorough coverage.
