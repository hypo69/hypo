# <algorithm>

The algorithm for generating PNG images from text lines involves several steps:

1. **Initialization:** The `TextToImageGenerator` class initializes default values for output directory, canvas size, padding, colors, and logging level.

2. **Input Handling:** The `generate_images` method receives a list of text lines (`lines`) and optional parameters for customization (output directory, font, size, etc.). It determines the output directory and configures logging based on the provided log level.


3. **Image Generation Loop:**
   - For each line in the `lines`:
     - It creates a path for the output PNG image (`img_path`).
     - It checks if the file already exists. If it does and `clobber` is False, it logs a warning and skips the line.
     - It calls the `generate_png` method to create the image for the current line.
     - It saves the generated image to the determined path.
     - Appends the generated image path to the `generated_images` list.


4. **Image Creation (`generate_png`):**
   - Creates a new image (`img`) with the specified `canvas_size` and `background_color`.
   - Creates a drawing object (`draw`).
   - Determines the font size using the `get_font_size` method.
   - Calculates the center position for the text using the `center_text_position` method.
   - Draws the text on the image at the calculated position using the specified `text_color` and `font`.
   - Returns the generated image (`img`).


5. **Text Positioning (`center_text_position`):**
   - Calculates the width and height of the text using the provided font.
   - Determines the coordinates to center the text on the canvas.
   - Returns the calculated position (x, y).


6. **File Conversion (webp2png):** The `webp2png` function converts a WEBP image to PNG format.


**Example Data Flow:**

Input: `lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2"]`, `output_dir = "./output"`
   - The generate_images method iterates. For "Line 1" it creates `./output/Line 1.png` and saves.
   - Same for "Line 2" creating `./output/Line 2.png`

**Dependencies:**

- `pathlib`: Used for working with file paths.
- `typing`: For type hinting.
- `PIL (Pillow)`:  For image manipulation (creating, drawing, saving).
- `src.logger`: For logging messages, likely using a custom logger.


# <explanation>

- **Imports:**
    - `pathlib`: Provides object-oriented way of working with filesystem paths. This module is beneficial for working with paths and is commonly used for handling file operations.
    - `typing`: Allows type hinting, making the code more readable and maintainable by specifying the types of variables and function parameters.
    - `PIL (Pillow)`:  A Python Imaging Library for image processing. It's crucial for the image generation functionality within this code, providing essential methods for creating, manipulating, and saving images.
    - `src.logger`:  A custom logger likely defined elsewhere in the `src` package for handling logging operations. This custom logger is used for more specific logging purposes than the standard `logging` module.


- **Classes:**
    - `TextToImageGenerator`:  This class encapsulates the logic for generating PNG images from text. It contains methods for handling image creation, output paths, text centering, and basic image manipulation tasks.

- **Functions:**
    - `generate_images`: Takes text lines and options to create and save PNG images. It handles file existence checks, output directory management, and generates a list of saved image paths.
    - `generate_png`: Creates a single PNG image from the provided text. It takes the text, size, colors, and font as arguments.
    - `center_text_position`: Calculates the position to center text within the image.
    - `webp2png`: Converts a WEBP image to PNG format.


- **Variables:**
    - `MODE`: A string variable that likely defines the current mode of the application. 
    - Various class variables (`default_output_dir`, `default_canvas_size`, etc.) represent default settings for image generation.

- **Possible Errors/Improvements:**
    - Error handling in `generate_images` could be more robust, e.g. catching `FileNotFoundError` if the input file doesn't exist.  Error handling could be expanded in `webp2png` to catch any exceptions that might occur during the image conversion process.
    - The code is slightly verbose; in some places, intermediate variable assignment could be minimized by reducing redundant operations.


- **Relationships with other parts of the project:** The code interacts with `src.logger` for logging, suggesting a modular design for managing logging across different parts of the project. The fact that `src.logger` is imported suggests there is a logging module in the `src` package with a specific structure for logging (or a related logging library).  The use of `Path` objects implies a potential relationship with other parts of the project that may also use this standardized approach to file handling.  The output is saved as PNG images, potentially indicating downstream usage of these images in other modules or applications.
