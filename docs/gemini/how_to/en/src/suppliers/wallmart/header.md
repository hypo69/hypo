How to use the `header.py` file

This file, `header.py`, is a crucial initialization script for your project.  It sets up the project's root directory, loads settings from a JSON file, and defines various project-related variables.  Let's break down how to use it:

**1. Project Structure:**

The file assumes a specific project structure.  Crucially, it looks for `settings.json` and `README.MD` files within a `src` directory at the project root.  It also relies on a `gs` module (likely a custom module) that provides a `gs.path` object to navigate the file system.  Ensure your project directory is organized as follows (adjust as needed):

```
project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── README.MD
│   └── ... (other source files)
├── requirements.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── .git/
└── ...
```


**2. `set_project_root` Function:**

This function is responsible for locating the project root directory. It starts from the current file's location and searches upward for any of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  This is essential for correctly referencing files and modules within the project.

   * **`marker_files` Argument:** This tuple specifies the files to search for when locating the root.  Modify this if your project uses different markers.

   * **`sys.path`:** The function adds the found root directory to `sys.path`. This makes it possible for Python to import modules from within the project.  This is important for importing modules located in the `src` directory (or other subdirectories) once the project root is determined.

**3. Loading Project Settings:**

The code attempts to load settings from `settings.json` located at the project root within `src/settings.json`. It handles potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`.  If the file does not exist, or the JSON is invalid, it sets `settings` to `None`.

```python
try:
    with open(gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    ...
```

**4. Loading Project Documentation:**

Similarly, the file tries to load documentation from `README.MD` file within `src/`. It handles possible errors.


**5. Defining Project Variables:**

The code defines several project variables, including `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__`.  These variables are populated from the `settings` dictionary (if available) or defaults.


**How to Use in Your Code:**

Once you've run `header.py`, the following variables will be available in any subsequent Python file within your project (e.g. a `main.py` file):

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.wallmart.header import __root__, __project_name__, __version__
# ... your code ...
print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs` Module:**  The code depends on the `gs` module. Ensure it's properly installed and available within your Python environment.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is critical.  The `try...except` blocks are crucial to prevent the script from crashing if the `settings.json` or `README.MD` files are missing or corrupted.
* **`MODE` Variable:** The `MODE` variable ('dev') appears to be for different project modes (e.g., development, production).  Consider how you'll use it and potentially alter the file loading paths in the different modes.
* **`requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`:** Using `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` is a good practice for dependency management.  Ensuring they are in the same directory as `header.py` will make setting the root directory work reliably.


This detailed guide provides a thorough understanding of how the `header.py` file functions and its intended use within a project. Remember to adapt the code according to your specific project structure and requirements.
