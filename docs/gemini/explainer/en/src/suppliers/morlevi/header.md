1. **Find Project Root:**
   - Input: current file path (`__file__`) and a tuple of marker files (`marker_files`).
   - Operation: Resolves the current file path to an absolute path. Starts from the current directory and iterates through its parent directories until it finds a directory containing one of the marker files.
   - Output: Path to the project root directory (`__root__`).
   - Example: If `__file__` points to `hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/header.py`, and the project root contains `pyproject.toml`, the function returns the path to the `hypotez` directory.

2. **Add Project Root to `sys.path`:**
   - Input: The project root path (`__root__`).
   - Operation: Adds the project root path to the `sys.path` list if it's not already present. This allows Python to import modules from the project's src directory.
   - Output: None.
   - Example: If `__root__` is `/path/to/hypotez`, it's added to `sys.path`.

3. **Load Project Settings:**
   - Input: Project root path (`__root__`).
   - Operation: Attempts to open and parse the `settings.json` file located within the `src` directory of the project root. Uses `json.load()` to parse the JSON data.
   - Output: The loaded project settings as a dictionary (`settings`).
   - Example: If `settings.json` exists and contains `{ "project_name": "MyProject", "version": "1.0.0" }`, `settings` will be `{"project_name": "MyProject", "version": "1.0.0"}`.

4. **Load Project Documentation:**
   - Input: Project root path (`__root__`).
   - Operation: Attempts to open and read the `README.MD` file from within the `src` directory of the project root.
   - Output: Project documentation string (`doc_str`) or None if not found or error occurs.
   - Example: If `README.MD` exists, its contents are read and assigned to `doc_str`.

5. **Extract Project Metadata:**
   - Input: Project settings (`settings`) and the documentation string (`doc_str`).
   - Operation: Extracts project name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and coffee support details from the settings, using `settings.get()` to handle missing keys with default values.
   - Output: Project metadata variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`).
   - Example: If `settings` contains the project name, and `README.MD` exists,  the extracted metadata is used to fill the metadata variables.

<explanation>

**Imports:**

- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, particularly used here for modifying the Python path.
- `json`: Used for encoding and decoding JSON data.
- `packaging.version`: Used for handling and comparing software version numbers.  Not directly used in this code but useful for version control and management.
- `pathlib`: Used to work with file paths in an object-oriented way, providing methods for handling file paths and resolving absolute paths.

**Classes:**

- No classes are defined in this file.

**Functions:**

- `set_project_root(marker_files=(\'pyproject.toml\', \'requirements.txt\', \'.git\')) -> Path`:
    - Args: A tuple of files/directories that can be used to locate the project root folder. Defaults to common project markers.
    - Return: The path to the root directory of the project.
    - Functionality: Recursively searches up the file system from the current file to find the first directory containing at least one of the specified marker files.  If found, it adds the root directory to the Python path, allowing modules in the project to be imported. This is crucial for a modular structure.
    - Example: If the script is in `hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/header.py`, and `pyproject.toml` exists in `hypotez`, it returns `hypotez`.
- No other functions are defined.

**Variables:**

- `MODE = \'dev\'`: A string specifying the application mode (likely for different configurations).
- `__root__`: Stores the project's root directory path. This is a crucial variable for accessing resources within the project.
- `settings`: A dictionary to store the project settings, retrieved from `settings.json`.
- `doc_str`: A string containing project documentation.
- `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:  Variables to store project metadata, obtained from `settings.json`.  They are initialized with defaults if `settings` is not loaded.

**Error Handling:**

- The code uses `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  This is good practice, as files might be missing during development or in certain circumstances.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Robustness:** The use of `if settings` in multiple places can be condensed into a `if settings is not None:` check.  This is stylistically preferred and removes unnecessary condition checks.  The initial use of a default value (`'hypotez'`) is better.
- **Type Hinting:** While type hints are used, it could be beneficial to specify types more rigorously throughout.
- **Logging:** Adding logging would allow for more details and debugging if something goes wrong.
- **Explicit Error Handling:** Instead of `...`, provide specific handling for each potential error or warn the user about the error.

**Relationships:**

- This file relies on `gs.path.root` (from `src.gs`) to locate project resources. This suggests that `gs` (likely a `globals` or `global_settings` module) provides a way to access the project root path.
