the `requests` library for HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing,

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clearer Docstrings:**  The docstrings are now much more informative, describing the purpose of each function and the expected return values in detail.  This is critical for maintainability.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The code now includes more comprehensive error handling. It checks for missing elements, invalid data formats (like non-integer prices), and HTTP errors.  Crucially, it logs *where* the errors occurred.  This is vital for debugging.
* **Explicit Return `False` on Failure:** Instead of returning multiple `False` values, the function now clearly returns `False` to signal that the extraction failed. This makes the calling code easier to handle.
* **Logging Enhancements:** Uses more informative log messages, including the URL, status code (if available), and any error details.
* **Data Validation:** Includes `try...except` blocks to catch `ValueError` if the price parsing fails.
* **`strip=True`:** Added `strip=True` to `get_text()`. This removes leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text.  This is crucial for robustness since extra spaces could cause parsing problems.
* **`maxsplit`:** Uses `maxsplit=1` in the `split()` method to correctly split the data into price and name, even if there's only one part.
* **`gs.now` fallback:** The `mexiron_name` now uses `gs.now` as a default if the split data doesn't have a name component, avoiding a crash. This handles cases where the format of the page is not entirely consistent.

**How to Use:**

```python
price, name, urls = fetch_target_urls_onetab("your_onetab_url")

if price:
  print(f"Price: {price}, Name: {name}, URLs: {urls}")
else:
  print("Failed to parse the page.") 
```


This revised solution is significantly more robust and reliable in handling various potential issues during the parsing process, and is crucial for production-level code. Remember to replace `"your_onetab_url"` with the actual URL you want to parse.  Also, make sure your logging setup is correctly configured.
