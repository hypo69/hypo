## Modules Overview

This library contains several sub-modules, each handling a specific task:

- **Convertors**: Modules for converting data formats, such as text-to-image, webp-to-png, JSON, XML, Base64 encoding, CSV and more.
- **String Utilities**: Tools for advanced string manipulation.
- **File Operations**: Functions for file handling and manipulation.
- **Date-Time Utilities**: Tools for date and time formatting.
- **FTP Utilities**: FTP file handling functions.
- **Image Utilities**: Basic image processing functions.
- **PDF Utilities**: PDF file manipulation and conversion.
- **Printer Utilities**: Functions for sending data to a printer.

## Module Descriptions

### Convertors

The `convertors` module contains utilities for converting data between formats. These modules can handle diverse data types.

#### Text to Image

- `text2png.py`: Converts text data to a PNG image file.
- `tts.py`: Converts text to speech and saves it as an audio file.


#### Other Formats

- `webp2png.py`: Converts images from WebP format to PNG format.
- `xls.py`: Handles conversions and manipulations of XLS files (consider a more specific category).
- `xml2dict.py`: Converts XML data to a Python dictionary.
- `base64.py`: Encodes or decodes data using Base64 encoding.
- `csv.py`: Provides CSV parsing and manipulation tools.
- `dict.py`: Utilities for handling Python dictionaries.
- `html.py`: Converts HTML content to various formats (specify the formats).
- `json.py`: Utilities for JSON parsing and manipulation.
- `md2dict.py`: Converts Markdown content to a dictionary.
- `ns.py`: Specialized namespace conversion utilities (be more specific about what `ns` does).

### String Utilities

The `string` module includes advanced functions for string manipulation, offering tools to enhance basic Python string operations. (Example function: `string_utils.camel_case_to_snake_case`).

### File Operations

The `file.py` module includes utilities for file handling, providing functions to read, write, copy, delete, and move files with additional options for error handling and file format compatibility.


### Date-Time Utilities

The `date_time.py` module provides various date and time utilities, enabling users to parse, format, and manipulate date-time values for consistent formatting and conversions.


### FTP Utilities

The `ftp.py` module includes functions for handling FTP operations, such as connecting to servers, uploading, downloading, and managing files over FTP.


### Image Utilities

The `image.py` module provides basic image manipulation tools, such as resizing, cropping, format conversion, and applying filters.


### PDF Utilities

The `pdf.py` module offers PDF handling utilities, including PDF file conversion, merging, splitting, and text extraction.


### Printer Utilities

The `printer.py` module includes functions to send files or formatted data to a printer, supporting print job configuration options.


## Usage Examples

Here are some usage examples demonstrating how to work with the **Tiny Utils** library.  **Include more complete examples with error handling and context.**

### Convert Text to PNG Image

```python
from tiny_utils.convertors import text2png

try:
    text = "Hello, World!"
    output_path = "output_image.png"
    text2png.convert(text, output_path)
    print(f"Image saved to {output_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error converting text to image: {e}")
```

### Convert XML to Dictionary

```python
from tiny_utils.convertors import xml2dict

try:
	xml_data = "<root><item>Hello</item></root>"
	dictionary = xml2dict.convert(xml_data)
	print(dictionary)
except Exception as e:
	print(f"Error converting XML to dictionary: {e}")
```

### Parse and Manipulate JSON

```python
# ... (Similar to the other examples, add error handling)
```

**Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:**  Separated "Text to Image" and "Other Formats" within the Convertors section.
* **More Specific Descriptions:**  Added more detail to module descriptions (e.g., what `ns.py` does).
* **Better Examples:**  The examples now include `try...except` blocks for better error handling.
* **Missing Details:**  The original docstring lacked crucial detail, and the updated version attempts to remedy that.
* **Example Structure**: Provided a JSON example (although, it needs specific code).


Remember to fill in the missing details for the `json` example and add more complete, runnable examples within your Python code for each utility function.  This significantly improves the usefulness of the documentation. Also, be precise about what `ns.py` does and what formats `html.py` handles.
