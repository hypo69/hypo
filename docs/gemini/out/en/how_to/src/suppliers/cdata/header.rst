How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` to locate the root directory of a project. It searches upwards from the current file's directory until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, it adds the root directory path to the Python import path (`sys.path`).  The code also loads project settings from a `settings.json` file and optionally a `README.MD` file, and then populates various project metadata variables (e.g., `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging.version`, `Path` from `pathlib`.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names as input.

3. **Determine the current file's directory:** It obtains the parent directory of the current file using `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`.

4. **Iterate upwards to find the root:** It iterates through parent directories of the current file until a directory containing any of the specified marker files is located.

5. **Add root to import path:** If a root directory is found, it's added to the `sys.path` to allow importing modules from the project's root directory.

6. **Load project settings:**  Attempts to open and parse a `settings.json` file located in the project's `src` directory.

7. **Load documentation:**  Attempts to read the contents of a `README.MD` file in the project's `src` directory.

8. **Populate metadata variables:** Extracts values from the `settings` dictionary (if found) for `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`.  If any of these settings are missing from `settings.json`, defaults are assigned.

9. **Return the root directory:** Returns the determined root directory.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.cdata.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage (assuming a project structure with pyproject.toml in the root)
    try:
        project_root = set_project_root()
        print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
        print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")  # Accessing the variable set in the code block
        # Example using the imported gs object (assuming it exists).
        # import src.gs as gs
        # print(gs.path.root)

        # ... further code using the found root ...

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
