**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** The provided code was extremely minimal. The example tests now use placeholder comments (`# from ... import ...`) where you should replace with your actual imports.  **Crucially**, you MUST import the `MODE` variable into your test file for the first test to run.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases (Example):**  The example tests are now more realistic and show how to handle different scenarios:
   - `test_mode_is_dev`: Checks if the `MODE` variable is initialized correctly, a fundamental test.
   - `test_non_existent_function`:  DemonStartes how to test for exceptions when dealing with non-existent functions.
   - `test_function_with_exception`: DemonStartes a test for exception handling. You would replace the `raise ValueError` with your actual function that might raise exceptions.
   - `test_function_edge_case`, `test_function_valid_input`, `test_function_invalid_input`:  These are placeholders to guide you in writing tests for your functions (replace with actual function calls, inputs, and expected outputs).

3. **`pytest.raises`:** The code now correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.

4. **Clear Comments:** The comments clearly indicate the purpose of each test function and the scenarios being tested.

5. **Missing Function Tests:**  The tests are now highly generic, providing a structure to build on.  The code you provided was too basic to create specific tests, so the examples provide a flexible framework.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder comments with actual imports from your `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/__init__.py` file, and replace the example function calls with your actual function calls.  Fill in the valid/invalid/edge-case inputs and the corresponding expected outputs.

2. **Run Tests:** Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_hypo69.py`) and run it using pytest from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_hypo69.py
   ```

This revised example gives a much better structure to create the tests for your code.  Remember to adapt these examples to the specific functions and behavior of the code you want to test.  The `pytest` framework helps significantly in organizing and running tests on different parts of your project. Remember to make the `test` functions start with the `test` keyword.
