**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Critically, the code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `Path.exists()` method. This is essential because `set_project_root` relies on file existence checks and `Path(__file__).resolve()`'s use in the original tests could create inconsistencies when run in different environments.  This isolates the test from external file system dependencies.

2. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories for the tests. This ensures that tests don't affect each other or the system's file structure.

3. **Mock Files:**  Fixtures `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` create temporary `settings.json` and `README.MD` files with pre-defined content.  This lets you test different scenarios without altering the actual file system.

4. **Comprehensive Tests:** Tests are added for various scenarios, including valid inputs, missing files, invalid JSON, and cases where the marker files are in different parent directories.

5. **Error Handling:**  The test `test_project_settings_invalid_json` demonstrates how to test the `try...except` block that handles potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`.


6. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive, making the tests easier to understand.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution is much more robust and thoroughly tests the code, handling edge cases and potential errors effectively. Remember to adapt the test fixture data to match the specific structure and data in the actual files that you want to test. Remember to adjust import statements to match your project structure if it differs.
