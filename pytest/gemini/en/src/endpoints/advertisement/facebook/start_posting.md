**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Objects:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to create mock objects for `Driver`, `Chrome`, and `FacebookPromoter`. This is crucial for testing the `FacebookPromoter` class without actually interacting with the Facebook API.


2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The provided test cases were rudimentary. The added tests cover more aspects, including:
   - `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_valid_input`: Checks if `run_campaigns` is called correctly.
   - `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_empty_input`: Tests for robustness with empty input.
   - `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_no_video`: Specifically tests the `no_video` attribute.
   - `test_facebook_promoter_while_loop_keyboard_interrupt`: Addresses the `KeyboardInterrupt` handling within the `while` loop, a crucial edge case.


3. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  The test for `KeyboardInterrupt` now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected exception.


4. **Fixtures:** Fixtures (`mock_driver`, `mock_promoter`) are defined to set up the testing environment.


5. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately clear.


6. **Placeholder Comments:** Comments are added to guide further test development for specific functions and methods within the `src` module (that are missing from the sample code).  You need to fill in those with tests based on the actual logic within `src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook`.


7. **Robustness:** Added a test for empty input lists.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Actual `src` Code:** To fully test the given code, you need the actual implementations of the classes and functions in `src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook`, `src.webdriver`, and `src.logger`. The provided example mocks those components.


- **Facebook API Interaction:**  If your code interacts with the Facebook API, you will need to adjust the mocks and testing strategy to handle API calls and responses.


- **External Dependencies:** If your code depends on other external resources (e.g., files, databases), you need to mock or isolate those dependencies in your tests.


- **Specific Tests:** Add tests for each function in `src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook` that perform actions, retrieve data, etc. These tests should cover various inputs to ensure proper handling of valid and invalid data.



Replace the placeholder comments with actual test cases for the methods and functions you need to test. Remember to use `pytest.raises` where relevant for checking expected exceptions, and use fixtures to avoid code duplication. This improved structure will allow you to test the given and the missing parts of the codebase efficiently.
