How to use the `hypotez/src/endpoints/emil/__init__.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/endpoints/emil/__init__.py`, initializes the Emil endpoint functionality.  It's part of a larger system likely handling Emil-related requests.  The current version sets a global `MODE` variable to 'dev', which is likely a configuration setting for the development environment.

**Key Functionality:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:**  This line sets a global variable named `MODE` to the string 'dev'.  This suggests a configuration switch between development (`dev`), testing (`test`), production (`prod`), or other modes. This mode setting is likely used by subsequent code to determine how the Emil endpoint should behave (e.g., logging level, database connection, API keys).

* **`from .emil_design import EmilDesign`:** This imports the `EmilDesign` class from the `emil_design.py` module within the `endpoints/emil` directory.  This is the core class responsible for handling Emil-related logic. The `. notation indicates a relative import.

**How to use it:**

This module itself likely isn't directly used by the application. Instead, its primary role is to initialize the necessary components for Emil interaction. To use the functionality, you should interact with the classes and functions exposed by the `emil_design.py` file, which will be imported from this file.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.emil import EmilDesign  # Import from the init file

# Instantiate the EmilDesign class
emil_instance = EmilDesign()

# Example of how you might interact with the design object
# ... (e.g., emil_instance.create_record(...), emil_instance.get_data(...))

# ... Your code to use EmilDesign
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`emil_design.py`:**  You'll need the `emil_design.py` file to understand and work with Emil functionalities. This file defines the class(es) and methods required for Emil interactions.
* **Configuration:** The `MODE` variable and related configuration options might be adjusted for different environments (dev, test, prod). The environment will heavily determine how the `EmilDesign` class operates.
* **Documentation:** Complete documentation in the `emil_design.py` file (using docstrings) will provide a detailed guide on the methods and parameters required for using the Emil endpoint.


**To further understand the usage:**

1. **Inspect `emil_design.py`:** Explore the implementation details of the `EmilDesign` class to learn how to utilize its functionalities.
2. **Consult any associated documentation:** There might be other files or documentation (comments, external guides) that clarify the intended functionality and usage scenarios.


This guide provides a high-level overview.  A more concrete example of usage will require the contents of `emil_design.py`.
