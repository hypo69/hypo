How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code initializes a module for interacting with the eBay API.  It defines a global variable `MODE` with a value of 'dev', likely indicating a development mode.  Importantly, it imports the `Graber` class from the `./graber` module within the `ebay` subdirectory.  This likely signifies that further functionality, such as fetching data or interacting with eBay, is defined within the `Graber` class.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code sets a global variable named `MODE` to the string value 'dev'.  This variable presumably controls behavior for the rest of the `ebay` module or related parts of the program.  This configuration is typically for development purposes.
2. The code imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` file (within the `ebay` directory).  This import allows usage of the functionalities defined in the `Graber` class.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.ebay import Graber

    # Assuming you have the necessary eBay API credentials set up.
    #  Credentials and other configuration would be handled within the Graber class.
    ebay_graber = Graber()  # Instantiate the Graber object

    # Example usage (replace with specific methods from Graber class)
    item_data = ebay_graber.get_item_details(item_id="12345")
    print(item_data)
