**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** The provided code didn't use any data, so I removed the unnecessary fixtures.

2. **`test_dir_root_calculation_with_no_hypotez()`:** This is a crucial test to handle the edge case where "hypotez" might not be present in the current working directory, preventing an `IndexError`.  It correctly returns the current working directory in that case. The `finally` block ensures that the original working directory is restored.

3. **`test_syspath_append_correct()` and `test_syspath_append_not_duplicate()`:** These tests check if the directories are added to `sys.path` correctly.
   - `test_syspath_append_correct()` verifies if both directories are added.
   - `test_syspath_append_not_duplicate()` verifies that the directories are not added multiple times (important for avoiding issues with repeated imports).  The `finally` block is added to restore the original state of `sys.path`.


4. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific and descriptive, making the tests easier to understand.

5. **Robustness:** The tests now handle the case where "hypotez" might not be found in the path, ensuring the code doesn't crash due to unexpected input.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved set of tests provides comprehensive coverage for the provided header file, validating the logic and handling potential edge cases, especially crucial for the dynamic path construction. Remember to adapt the tests if the code in the header file changes. Remember to place `test_header.py` in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_examples` folder, or adjust the import paths accordingly.
