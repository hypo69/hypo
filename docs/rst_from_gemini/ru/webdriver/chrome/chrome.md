# `chrome.py` - Chrome WebDriver Implementation

**File:** `hypotez/src/webdriver/chrome/chrome.py`

**Role:** `doc_creator` (Creating documentation)

**Description:**

This Python file implements a Chrome WebDriver class, designed for use in the `hypotez` project. It leverages the `selenium` library and provides a way to interact with the Chrome browser.  Critically, it focuses on managing a single instance of the WebDriver, handling potential errors during initialization and providing tools for interaction with the browser's page content.

**Key Features:**

* **Singleton Pattern:** The `Chrome` class is implemented as a singleton, ensuring only one instance of the WebDriver is created. This is important for resource management and preventing conflicts. The `__new__` method and `_instance` attribute handle this.  Crucially, the `window_open()` method is called if an instance already exists to support multi-tab operation.
* **Configuration from JSON:**  It loads configuration settings from a `chrome.json` file (located in `hypotez/src/webdriver/chrome`). This allows for externalizing WebDriver settings (like executable path, options, and user data directories).
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling (using `try...except` blocks) to catch potential issues during WebDriver initialization and execution. Logging is used to report errors effectively.  This prevents the script from crashing due to minor configuration issues.
* **User Agent:**  Supports setting a custom user agent for simulating different browsers, potentially improving compatibility or privacy (defaulting to a randomly generated agent).
* **Page Interaction Tools:** The `_payload` method dynamically initializes helpers (`JavaScript`, `ExecuteLocator`) to provide methods for common browser tasks like JavaScript execution, locating elements, handling screenshots and attribute retrieval.  It improves code organization and readability by consolidating these helpers.
* **Environment Variable Handling:** The `normilize_path` function elegantly deals with environment variables within paths, making the configuration more adaptable to different operating systems and development environments.


**Class Structure and Functionality:**

The `Chrome` class inherits from `webdriver.Chrome`.

* `__new__`:  Ensures only one instance.
* `__init__`:  Initializes the WebDriver with options and profile (from `chrome.json`).
* `_payload`:  Sets up JavaScript and `ExecuteLocator` instances for complex page interactions.
* `window_open`:  Opens a new tab in the current browser window and switches to it (essential for multi-tab handling).


**Example Usage (Conceptual):**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.chrome import Chrome

# Initialize the Chrome WebDriver (the singleton pattern does this)
driver = Chrome(user_agent='mycustom-useragent')

# Perform actions on the browser
# ...

driver.quit()
```


**Critical Considerations:**

* **`chrome.json` Structure:** The `chrome.json` file should be structured to follow the expected format, ideally validated to prevent runtime errors. Example:
```json
{
  "options": {
    "headless": true,  
    "window-size": "1920x1080",
  },
  "executable_path": {
    "default": "path/to/chromedriver"
  },
  "profile_directory": {
    "default": "%LOCALAPPDATA%/MyChromeProfile"
  },
  "headers": { 
    "accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8"
  }
}
```
* **Error Reporting:** The extensive use of logging (`logger.error`, `logger.critical`) is crucial for debugging issues, particularly in a large project.
* **Path Normalization:** The `normilize_path` function significantly improves portability and reduces potential problems with inconsistent paths.
