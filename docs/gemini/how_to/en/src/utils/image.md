This guide explains how to use the `hypotez/src/utils/image.py` module for downloading, saving, and retrieving image data asynchronously.

**Module Overview:**

The `image.py` module provides functions for handling image operations, specifically focusing on asynchronous tasks.  It uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests, `aiofiles` for asynchronous file operations, and `PIL` (Pillow) for image manipulation.  Crucially, it incorporates logging (`logger`) for error handling and `pprint` for debugging (though the latter is unused in the provided examples).

**Key Functions:**

* **`save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None`:** Downloads an image from a given URL, saves it as a PNG file, and returns the file path if successful.  It handles errors during the download process.


* **`save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None`:** Takes binary image data and saves it as a PNG file at the specified location. This function is crucial for saving images from various sources (e.g., from an API).  It creates any necessary parent directories, verifies that the file was successfully created, and further validates the file size to ensure it's not empty.


* **`get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None`:** Reads the binary data of a file if it exists, and returns the data if successful.  It returns `None` if the file is not found or there's an error during reading.


**How to Use:**

**1. Downloading an Image from a URL:**

```python
import asyncio
from hypotez.src.utils.image import save_png_from_url

async def main():
    url = "https://example.com/image.png"  # Replace with the actual URL
    filename = "downloaded_image.png"
    file_path = await save_png_from_url(url, filename)
    if file_path:
        print(f"Image downloaded to: {file_path}")
    else:
        print("Failed to download image.")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**2. Saving Image Data:**

```python
import asyncio
from hypotez.src.utils.image import save_png
import io

async def main():
    # Replace with actual image data
    with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
        image_data = f.read()
    filename = "saved_image.png"
    file_path = await save_png(image_data, filename)
    if file_path:
        print(f"Image saved to: {file_path}")
    else:
        print("Failed to save image.")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**3. Retrieving Image Data:**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.image import get_image_data

def main():
    filename = "saved_image.png"
    image_bytes = get_image_data(filename)
    if image_bytes:
        print(f"Image data: {image_bytes[:20]}...")  # Show first 20 bytes
    else:
        print("Failed to retrieve image data.")

main()
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The functions include robust error handling using `try...except` blocks and logging.  Examine the logs for specific error details if a function call fails.

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Use `asyncio.run()` to run the asynchronous functions, as shown in the examples.

* **File Existence Checks:**  The `get_image_data` function explicitly checks if the file exists before attempting to read it, and other functions implicitly do so within their `try` blocks.

* **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`aiohttp`, `aiofiles`, `Pillow`).  You might need to install them using `pip install aiohttp aiofiles Pillow`.

* **Context Managers:** The use of `async with aiofiles.open(...)` ensures proper resource management during file operations.


This comprehensive guide provides clear instructions and examples for effectively using the `image.py` module, addressing potential errors and emphasizing good programming practices. Remember to replace placeholder values (e.g., URLs, filenames) with your actual data.
