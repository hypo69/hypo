```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now use `js2py` to evaluate the JavaScript code within a Python environment. This is crucial because we can't directly interact with a browser's DOM within a pytest test.  We mock the necessary parts of the JavaScript environment (`document`, `chrome`).

2. **Simulating Data:**  We create mock data for `chrome.tabs.query`'s return value, including `active_tab_url`.  This way, we're controlling the input to the JavaScript code.

3. **Clear Assertions:**  We added assertions to verify that the expected alerts are displayed.

4. **Two Test Cases:** The code now includes tests for both success and failure scenarios, making it more robust.

5. **Error Handling (Crucial):**  The original code doesn't handle the case where sending the URL fails.  Our test demonStartes checking for a 'failed' response, ensuring the code has a fallback.

6. **Fixture considerations**:  If `active_tab_url` was frequently used or came from a different source, a fixture would be beneficial.  However, it is not critical for this simplified example.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install `js2py`:
    ```bash
    pip install js2py
    ```

2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_popup.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_popup.py
    ```


This revised solution is significantly more robust and realistic for testing JavaScript code that interacts with browser APIs. Remember that for more complex interactions, using browser automation libraries like Selenium would be even more powerful for testing.  If `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or `chrome.tabs.query` fails (which are likely to be browser-specific), you would need to adjust this example to match the specific browser and test environment.
