# Add more tests as needed, covering various aspects of the code.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `logger`:** The `mock_logger` fixture now properly mocks the logger using `unittest.mock.patch`. This isolates the test from external logging behavior.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more descriptive, clarifying the expected state after each step.

3. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Added `test_scenario_1_no_begin` and `test_scenario_1_begin_twice` to test the scenario where `begin` isn't called and when it is called twice.  These tests use `pytest.raises` to verify the expected exception.  Crucially, these tests highlight the need for error handling in the original code.

4. **Placeholder Assertions (Crucial):** The critical placeholder assertions for file creation (`os.path.exists`) are included. These need to be replaced with actual assertions that verify the existence and contents of the checkpoint files.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The initial test now covers the basic functionality of starting, checkpointing, and ending the simulation, but more tests are *essential* to thoroughly cover the code.  You need to:
   - Test the `create_*` functions to ensure they handle invalid data or edge cases properly.
   - Create tests verifying proper exception handling throughout the code (e.g., if `agent.define()` is called with inappropriate data types).
   - Test how `control.reset()` affects the simulation state.


**To make the tests runnable:**

- **`testing_utils.py`:**  Ensure this module exists and provides the necessary functions that the code under test depends on.  Without this missing part, you won't be able to run the tests.
- **`tinytroupe` module:**  Make sure the `tinytroupe` package's modules (e.g., `agent`, `environment`, `factory`, `extraction`, `control`) are correctly structured and runnable.


Remember, thoroughly testing the `create_*` functions, the `tinytroupe` package modules, and the exception handling is crucial for a complete test suite.  The provided tests are a starting point and require significant expansion to achieve comprehensive test coverage.
