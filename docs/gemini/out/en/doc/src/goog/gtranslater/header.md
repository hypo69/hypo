# hypotez/src/goog/gtranslater/header.py

## Overview

This module defines functions for setting the project root directory and loading project settings. It leverages the `gs` module for path manipulation and `json` for data loading. Error handling is implemented to gracefully manage situations like missing settings files.  The module also handles retrieving and storing project metadata like name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a coffee link.


## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project, starting from the current file's directory, by searching upwards for specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root. Defaults to a tuple containing `'pyproject.toml'`, `'requirements.txt'`, and `.git`.

**Returns**:

- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.

**Raises**:

- No exceptions are explicitly raised, but the function does rely on the existence of the marker files.


### `__root__`

**Description**: (Variable)  Holds the path to the project root directory as determined by the `set_project_root` function.

**Type**: `Path`

**Purpose**:  Stores the determined root path for later use in the module.


## Loading Project Settings and Documentation


**Description:** The code attempts to load project settings from `src/settings.json` and project documentation from `src/README.MD` within the project root.  Error handling mechanisms using `try...except` blocks address potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions in case the files are missing or have an invalid format.


## Project Metadata Retrieval

**Description:** The following code extracts various metadata like project name, version, author, copyright, and a coffee link from the loaded settings (`settings` variable) if available.


**Variables**:

- `__project_name__`: (str): Name of the project. Defaults to "hypotez" if no settings are loaded or "project_name" is missing.
- `__version__`: (str): Version of the project. Defaults to an empty string if no settings are loaded or "version" is missing.
- `__doc__`: (str): Project documentation string. Defaults to an empty string if no documentation is loaded.
- `__details__`: (str): Additional project details. Currently empty.
- `__author__`: (str): Author of the project. Defaults to an empty string if no settings are loaded or "author" is missing.
- `__copyright__`: (str): Copyright information. Defaults to an empty string if no settings are loaded or "copyright" is missing.
- `__coffee__`: (str): Link to treat the developer to coffee. Defaults to a pre-defined link if not found in the settings.
