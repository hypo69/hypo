### Understanding the Problem

First, let's restate the problem to ensure clarity:

- **Checkerboard Setup**: A standard 8x8 checkerboard with 64 squares.
- **Initial Placement**: 48 checkers are placed on the two outside rows (the first and last rows) of the checkerboard.
  
  ```

  • • • • • • • • 
  • • 
  • • 
  • •

  • • • • • • • • 
  • • • • • • • • 
  ```

- **Objective**: Remove as many checkers as possible by making diagonal jumps, similar to standard checkers rules.
  
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: Remove 30 to 39 checkers.
  - **Challenge**: Remove 40 to 44 checkers.
  - **Substantial Feat**: Remove 45 to 47 checkers.

### Initial Observations

1. **Checker Placement**: The checkers are only on the outermost rows, leaving the central area empty. This setup might limit the number of possible jumps initially.
   
2. **Jump Mechanics**: In standard checkers, a jump is made diagonally over an adjacent opponent's piece into a vacant square immediately beyond it. The jumped piece is then removed from the board.

3. **Objective Clarity**: The goal is to maximize the number of checkers removed, not necessarily to clear the board entirely.

### Planning the Approach

To tackle this problem, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Visual Representation**: Create a visual or mental map of the checkerboard to track the positions of the checkers and possible moves.

2. **Identify Possible Jumps**: Look for sequences of jumps that can remove multiple checkers in a single turn.

3. **Maximize Removals**: Aim for moves that remove the most checkers, possibly by creating cascading jumps.

4. **Avoid Deadlocks**: Ensure that the remaining checkers don't get stuck without possible jumps.

5. **Iterative Strategy**: Make a move, reassess the board, and plan the next move accordingly.

### Step 1: Visual Representation

Let's label the rows and columns for easier reference:

```
    A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H
1   •   •   •   •   •   •   •   • 
2   •   •   •   •   •   •   •   • 
3   •   • 
4   •   • 
5   •   • 
6   •   • 
7   •   • 
8   •   • 
9   •   • 
10  •   • 
11  •   •   •   •   •   •   •   • 
12  •   •   •   •   •   •   •   • 
```

*Note: Typically, a checkerboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, labeled 1 to 8. Here, for clarity, I've extended the labeling to accommodate the initial setup.*

### Step 2: Identify Possible Jumps

Given the initial setup, the checkers are only on rows 1, 2, 11, and 12. The central rows (3 to 10) are empty, which means that jumps can only occur towards the center.

Let's consider possible jumps from the outermost rows:

- **From Row 1**: Checkers can jump diagonally forward into rows 3 and 4.
  
- **From Row 2**: Similarly, checkers can jump into rows 3 and 4.

- **From Row 11**: Checkers can jump diagonally backward into rows 9 and 10.
  
- **From Row 12**: Similarly, checkers can jump into rows 9 and 10.

### Step 3: Maximize Removals

To maximize the number of checkers removed, we need to create sequences where one jump leads to another, effectively removing multiple checkers in a chain.

**Example Scenario**:

1. **First Jump**: A checker from A1 jumps over B2 to land on C3. The checker at B2 is removed.

2. **Second Jump**: The checker now at C3 can jump over D4 to land on E5. The checker at D4 is removed.

3. **Third Jump**: The checker at E5 can jump over F6 to land on G7. The checker at F6 is removed.

This sequence removes three checkers in a single turn.

### Step 4: Avoid Deadlocks

It's crucial to plan jumps in such a way that the remaining checkers still have possible moves. If checkers are left without any possible jumps, the game ends prematurely, and we might not achieve the maximum number of removals.

**Potential Deadlock Scenario**:

If all checkers are moved towards the center without leaving any on the edges, future jumps might be limited. Therefore, it's essential to balance the movement towards the center while keeping some checkers on the edges to facilitate further jumps.

### Step 5: Iterative Strategy

Let's attempt to outline a sequence of moves:

**Move 1**:
- **Jump**: A1 jumps over B2 to C3.
- **Removed**: B2.

**Move 2**:
- **Jump**: C3 jumps over D4 to E5.
- **Removed**: D4.

**Move 3**:
- **Jump**: E5 jumps over F6 to G7.
- **Removed**: F6.

**Move 4**:
- **Jump**: G7 jumps over H8 to I9 (assuming the board extends, but since it's an 8x8 board, this jump isn't possible).
  
*Realization*: The board is only 8x8, so jumps beyond row 8 aren't possible. Therefore, the sequence ends here, removing three checkers.

This indicates that our initial approach might not be optimal. Let's reconsider.

### Re-evaluating the Strategy

Perhaps starting from a different position or considering multiple simultaneous jump sequences could yield better results.

**Alternative Approach**:

1. **Simultaneous Jumps**: Look for opportunities where multiple checkers can make jumps in the same turn, leading to more removals.

2. **Central Control**: Focus on controlling the central squares to facilitate more jump opportunities.

**Example**:

- **Move 1**:
  - **Jump 1**: A1 jumps over B2 to C3. Removes B2.
  - **Jump 2**: H1 jumps over G2 to F3. Removes G2.

- **Move 2**:
  - **Jump 1**: C3 jumps over D4 to E5. Removes D4.
  - **Jump 2**: F3 jumps over E4 to D5. Removes E4.

- **Move 3**:
  - **Jump 1**: E5 jumps over F6 to G7. Removes F6.
  - **Jump 2**: D5 jumps over C6 to B7. Removes C6.

This sequence removes six checkers in three moves, which is more efficient.

### Calculating Total Removals

If we can consistently remove two checkers per move, starting from 48 checkers:

- **After 20 moves**: 40 checkers removed (2 per move).
  
- **Remaining Checkers**: 8.

This suggests that removing 40 checkers is achievable with this strategy.

### Exploring Higher Removal Counts

To remove more than 40 checkers, we need to find ways to remove more than two checkers per move or optimize the sequence to leave fewer remaining checkers.

**Potential Strategy**:

- **Cascading Jumps**: Create situations where a single jump leads to multiple subsequent jumps in the same turn.

**Example**:

1. **Move 1**:
   - **Jump 1**: A1 jumps over B2 to C3. Removes B2.
   - **Jump 2**: C3 jumps over D4 to E5. Removes D4.
   - **Jump 3**: E5 jumps over F6 to G7. Removes F6.

   This single move removes three checkers.

2. **Move 2**:
   - **Jump 1**: H1 jumps over G2 to F3. Removes G2.
   - **Jump 2**: F3 jumps over E4 to D5. Removes E4.
   - **Jump 3**: D5 jumps over C6 to B7. Removes C6.

   Another three checkers removed.

Continuing this pattern:

- **Total Moves**: 16 (since 48 checkers / 3 per move = 16 moves).

- **Checkers Removed**: 48.

However, this seems too optimistic, as it suggests removing all checkers, which contradicts the problem statement indicating that removing 45 to 47 is a substantial feat.

### Identifying the Flaw

Upon reflection, the assumption that every move can remove three checkers is unrealistic. The board's constraints and the initial placement likely prevent such a high rate of removal.

### Refining the Strategy

Let's aim for a more balanced approach, targeting the removal of two checkers per move, with occasional opportunities to remove three.

**Revised Plan**:

- **Average Removal Rate**: 2.5 checkers per move.

- **Total Moves**: 48 / 2.5 = ~19 moves.

- **Checkers Removed**: 47.5 (rounded to 47).

This aligns with the problem's indication that removing 45 to 47 checkers is a substantial feat.

### Implementing the Strategy

Let's attempt to outline a sequence that achieves this:

**Move 1**:
- **Jump 1**: A1 jumps over B2 to C3. Removes B2.
- **Jump 2**: H1 jumps over G2 to F3. Removes G2.

**Move 2**:
- **Jump 1**: C3 jumps over D4 to E5. Removes D4.
- **Jump 2**: F3 jumps over E4 to D5. Removes E4.

**Move 3**:
- **Jump 1**: E5 jumps over F6 to G7. Removes F6.
- **Jump 2**: D5 jumps over C6 to B7. Removes C6.

**Move 4**:
- **Jump 1**: G7 jumps over H8 to I9 (invalid, as the board only goes up to row 8).
  
*Adjustment Needed*: Since jumps beyond row 8 aren't possible, we need to find alternative jumps.

**Alternative Jump**:
- **Jump 1**: G7 jumps over F8 to E9 (invalid).

*Realization*: The checker at G7 cannot make a valid jump. Therefore, this move only removes one checker.

**Revised Move 4**:
- **Jump 1**: B7 jumps over A8 to C9 (invalid).

*Another Dead End*: The checker at B7 also cannot make a valid jump.

This indicates that after three moves, we've removed six checkers, but the fourth move is problematic.

### Reassessing the Approach

Given this roadblock, perhaps starting the jumps from different positions or altering the sequence can help maintain the removal rate.

**Alternative Starting Point**:

Instead of starting from the corners, let's begin jumps from the middle of the outer rows.

**Move 1**:
- **Jump 1**: D1 jumps over E2 to F3. Removes E2.
- **Jump 2**: E1 jumps over D2 to C3. Removes D2.

**Move 2**:
- **Jump 1**: F3 jumps over G4 to H5. Removes G4.
- **Jump 2**: C3 jumps over B4 to A5. Removes B4.

**Move 3**:
- **Jump 1**: H5 jumps over G6 to F7. Removes G6.
- **Jump 2**: A5 jumps over B6 to C7. Removes B6.

**Move 4**:
- **Jump 1**: F7 jumps over E8 to D9 (invalid).
  
*Again, a dead end*.

### Conclusion from Attempts

From these attempts, it's evident that maintaining a high removal rate is challenging due to the board's constraints. The initial optimism of removing three checkers per move isn't sustainable, and even removing two checkers per move leads to deadlocks after a few moves.

### Estimating Achievable Removals

Given the constraints:

- **Easy (30-39)**: Achievable with basic jump sequences, removing around 1.5 to 2 checkers per move.

- **Challenge (40-44)**: Requires more optimized sequences, possibly averaging around 2.2 to 2.5 checkers per move.

- **Substantial Feat (45-47)**: Demands highly efficient sequences, approaching the theoretical maximum, with minimal deadlocks.

### Final Strategy

To aim for the higher end of removals (45-47), the strategy should focus on:

1. **Maximizing Simultaneous Jumps**: Plan moves that allow multiple checkers to jump in the same turn.

2. **Central Control**: Keep as many checkers as possible in positions that can facilitate future jumps.

3. **Avoiding Isolation**: Ensure that checkers aren't left in positions where they cannot participate in jumps.

4. **Flexible Planning**: Be prepared to adjust the strategy based on the evolving state of the board.

### Step-by-Step Optimal Removal Sequence

While it's challenging to outline every move without visual aids, here's a conceptual sequence aiming for 45-47 removals:

1. **Initial Moves**: Start by creating multiple jump opportunities from different sections of the outer rows.

2. **Cascade Jumps**: Aim for sequences where one jump enables another, creating a chain reaction.

3. **Centralize Checkers**: Move checkers towards the center to increase jump possibilities.

4. **Balance Edge and Center**: Maintain some checkers on the edges to prevent complete centralization, which could limit future jumps.

5. **Final Moves**: As the number of checkers decreases, focus on removing isolated checkers without leaving others stranded.

### Final Answer

After carefully analyzing the problem and experimenting with different strategies, it's clear that removing 45 to 47 checkers from the initial setup of 48 on a standard checkerboard is indeed a substantial feat. Achieving this requires a highly optimized sequence of diagonal jumps, maximizing simultaneous removals, and carefully managing the positions of the remaining checkers to avoid deadlocks.

While the exact step-by-step moves are complex and would benefit from visual representation or simulation, the key to success lies in:

- **Strategic Planning**: Anticipating future moves and setting up cascading jumps.
  
- **Efficient Use of Space**: Balancing the distribution of checkers between the edges and the center.
  
- **Adaptability**: Being ready to adjust the strategy as the game progresses and the board state changes.

By meticulously applying these principles, one can approach the upper echelons of checker removal, achieving the remarkable feat of eliminating 45 to 47 checkers from the initial 48.

### Rules of the Checkers Puzzle

Before diving into the Python code, let's clearly define the rules and constraints of the puzzle:

1. **Checkerboard Setup**:
   - The board is an 8x8 grid (standard checkerboard).
   - Initially, 48 checkers are placed on the two outermost rows (rows 1 and 8).

2. **Checker Movement**:
   - Checkers can only move diagonally.
   - A checker can "jump" over an adjacent checker diagonally if the landing square is empty.
   - The jumped checker is removed from the board.

3. **Objective**:
   - Remove as many checkers as possible by performing valid jumps.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of checkers removed.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Only one checker can be moved per turn.
   - Jumps must follow the standard checker rules (diagonal jumps over an adjacent checker into an empty square).

5. **Termination**:
   - The game ends when no more valid jumps are possible.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Checkerboard Initialization**:
   - The `Checkerboard` class initializes an 8x8 grid with 48 checkers placed on the outermost rows.

2. **Jump Validation**:
   - The `is_valid_jump` function checks if a jump is valid by ensuring:
     - The landing position is within the board.
     - The landing position is empty.
     - There is a checker to jump over.
     - The jump is diagonal.

3. **Performing Jumps**:
   - The `perform_jump` function moves the checker and removes the jumped checker, updating the board and the count of removed checkers.

4. **Finding Possible Jumps**:
   - The `find_possible_jumps` function scans the board for all valid jumps.

5. **Game Simulation**:
   - The `play` function simulates the game by repeatedly performing valid jumps until no more jumps are possible.

6. **Board Display**:
   - The `display_board` function prints the current state of the board for visualization.

### Notes

- The current implementation performs the first valid jump it finds. To maximize the number of checkers removed, you can optimize the jump selection (e.g., prioritize jumps that open up more opportunities).
- The code can be extended to allow user input for manual play or to implement more advanced strategies for automated play.
