Here's the translated prompt in English:

**Prompt for generating `how to` documentation for code blocks**

1. You need to analyze the current block of code and all previously loaded code blocks in the project. Based on this analysis, you will create a step-by-step instruction that describes what actions need to be taken to execute the given code block.

2. For each code block, you should create a detailed instruction in reStructuredText (RST) format, following these steps:

    - **Description**: Explain what this code block does, for example, what task it solves or what validation it performs.
    - **Execution steps**: Describe the sequence of actions that need to be performed for the code to execute. For each step, explain in detail what happens during the process.
    - **Usage example**: Provide an example of how this code can be used in the project, including possible function or method calls.

3. The structure of the documentation for each code block should be as follows:

```rst
How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block performs [describe the actions of the code block, for example, "a validation check on input data"].

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. [First step, for example, "Retrieve data by calling the `get_data()` function."]\n
2. [Second step, for example, "Validate the data using the `validate_data()` method."]\n
3. [Third step, for example, "If the data is valid, further processing is performed."]\n
4. [Continue as needed...]

Usage example
-------------------------
An example of how to use this code block in a project:

.. code-block:: python

    <example_code_usage>
```

4. When writing documentation, be sure to:

    - If the code block performs a check, describe how it works and what data is being validated.
    - If the code block calls other functions or methods, be sure to specify which functions are called and with what parameters.
    - Use precise wording, avoiding vague terms like "getting" or "doing." Instead, describe what the code specifically does: "the code checks," "the code sends a request," and so on.

5. Example for a code block that performs a variable check:

```rst
How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block performs a validation check on the `value` variable before further processing.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. Retrieve the value of the `value` variable by calling the `get_value()` method.
2. Check if the value is empty or invalid. If so, log an error message and halt execution.
3. If the value is valid, pass it to the next function for further processing.

Usage example
-------------------------
An example of how to use this code block:

.. code-block:: python

    value = get_value()
    if value:
        process_value(value)
    else:
        logger.error('Invalid value')
```

6. Each code block should be documented in this format, with clear and understandable steps explaining what the code does and with an example of how it can be used.

---

This prompt gives you the instructions to create detailed documentation for each code block based on its analysis. You will generate documentation that explains the sequence of actions for executing the code, as well as provide usage examples.
```

**2. <algorithm>**

The code itself is not executable code. It's a description of how to write documentation for other code blocks. The algorithm for generating the documentation is defined by the steps in the prompt.  There's no specific data flow or processing to diagram.

**3. <mermaid>**

    D --> E[Format Documentation (RST)];
    E --> F[Output Documentation];
```

**Explanation:**

This prompt defines a process for generating documentation for code blocks. The process analyzes the code, extracts information (description, execution steps, and usage example), formats it in reStructuredText, and outputs the documentation.  There's no direct data flow between functions, classes or methods in this prompt.  The diagram shows the process steps.

**4. <explanation>**

The provided code is a *prompt* for generating documentation, not actual executable code. It describes the desired structure and content of reStructuredText documentation for Python code blocks.  It directs the creation of documentation.

- **Imports:**  There are no imports in the code as it is a prompt rather than a program.

- **Classes:** There are no classes, only functional instructions to create and structure RST documentation.

- **Functions:** There are no functions or methods called within the prompt itself. The prompt defines a set of instructions and rules for creating the documentation for functions, methods or other code blocks in some language, most likely Python.

- **Variables:**  The prompt mentions `value`, `get_value()`, `process_value()`, `logger`, but these are within the context of an example, not actual variables.

- **Possible Errors/Improvements:**  The prompt is well-defined, but the prompt itself is not prone to errors, as it's a set of instructions.  The real potential for errors is in the implementation of this prompt in an automated documentation generation system.  For example, the system needs to be able to properly parse the given code.


**Relationships to other parts of the project:**

This prompt defines the *format* for documentation generation, not a specific code block itself.  It will be used in a system that analyzes code blocks, generates, and stores the documentation.  It's a specification, not a component of a program itself.
