```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Introduced `mock_settings_file` and `project_root` fixtures for better test organization and isolation.  `tmp_path` is used to create temporary directories for testing without affecting the actual file system.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive, indicating the specific input and expected outcome.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where the marker files aren't found, and the project root is already in `sys.path`, ensuring robustness.
* **Exception Handling:** Included tests (`test_settings_loading_file_not_found`, `test_settings_loading_json_decode_error`) to verify that the code handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` correctly, assigning `None` to `settings` when appropriate.
* **Correct `assert` Statements:** Updated asserts to match the expected outcomes for the loading.
* **Import Fixes:** Added `from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.header import settings` inside the test functions for `settings` to be accessible. 
* **File Existence Check:** The `test_settings_loading_success` now correctly checks that `settings_path` is a Path object, preventing an AttributeError.

This improved solution covers a wider range of scenarios and uses fixtures for better test organization, making the tests more readable, maintainable, and reliable.  Remember to adapt the import paths (`from ...`) to match your actual project structure if it's different. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`). Then, run the tests with `pytest`.
