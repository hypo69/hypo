Changes Made
```

- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (RST format) for both functions, adhering to Python docstring standards.  Included type hints (`:param`, `:type`, `:return`, `:rtype`) and possible exception types for robustness.
- Wrapped `base64_to_tmpfile` and `base64encode` in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions and log errors using the `logger`.
- Improved error handling:  `logger.error` is now used to log exceptions, providing more context for debugging.

- Removed the unused `base64encode` function and the associated code, as it was commented out, which is not helpful in the current code context.
