How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a `CampaignEditor` widget for a graphical user interface (GUI) application.  It allows users to select a JSON file containing campaign data, load it, display relevant fields, and prepare the campaign. The code utilizes PyQt6 for GUI elements, `qasync` for asynchronous operations, and custom functions for setting fixed sizes of widgets. Error handling is implemented to catch and display potential issues during file loading and campaign preparation.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports PyQt6 modules for GUI elements, `asyncio` for asynchronous operations, `pathlib` for file paths, `types` for data types, and custom modules like `jjson` for JSON handling and `AliCampaignEditor`.


2. **Define the `CampaignEditor` class:** This class represents the main widget for editing campaigns.  It holds instance variables for campaign data (`data`), the current campaign file path (`current_campaign_file`), and an editor (`editor`).


3. **`__init__` method:** Initializes the `CampaignEditor` widget, sets up the UI, and establishes connections between UI elements and their actions (e.g., button clicks).


4. **`setup_ui` method:** Sets the window title and size, creates a scroll area for accommodating potential large campaign data, and initializes UI elements such as buttons, input fields for campaign title, description and promotion name.


5. **`open_file` method:** Displays a file dialog for selecting a JSON file containing campaign data. If a file is chosen, it calls `load_file` to process the data.


6. **`load_file` method:** Loads the JSON file using `j_loads_ns` and updates the UI to display the campaign data. It creates text fields and sets their values from the loaded data, removing previously added fields if any.


7. **`create_widgets` method:** Creates and adds input fields (e.g., title, description, promotion name) to the UI based on the loaded data.  Importantly, it removes previously created widgets to prevent duplication.


8. **`prepare_campaign` method (async):** Prepares the campaign asynchronously using the `AliCampaignEditor` instance, which likely contains campaign-specific preparation logic. Displays success or error messages based on the outcome of preparation.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.gui.campaign import CampaignEditor

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app = QApplication(sys.argv)
        main_app = None  # Replace with your main application instance if needed
        campaign_editor = CampaignEditor(main_app=main_app)
        campaign_editor.show()
        sys.exit(app.exec())

This example demonStartes how to create and display the `CampaignEditor` window.  Remember to replace `main_app` with your application instance if using one. This starts the PyQt application, creates an instance of `CampaignEditor` and displays it.
