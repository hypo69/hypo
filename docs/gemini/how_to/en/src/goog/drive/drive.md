**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  Crucially, the `upload_file` method now includes a `try...except` block to catch `HttpError` exceptions that can occur during the upload process.  This prevents the script from crashing and provides informative error messages.  This is essential for production-level code.


* **Folder Handling:** The code now correctly searches for the folder.  It's also important to note that a folder with the *exact* name given in `folder_name` must exist.  If the folder doesn't exist, the upload will fail.


* **Clearer Variable Names:** `creds_file` was changed to a more descriptive name.

* **`main()` Function:** The `main` function is now more concise and demonstrates a better way to use the `GoogleDriveHandler` class.


* **Missing Import:** The import for `MediaIoBaseUpload` and `HttpError` (from `googleapiclient.http`) was added.  This is essential for file uploads.

* **`pprint` and `logger`:** Using `pprint` is a good option for better output; `logger` is essential for recording errors.


**To run this code:**

1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-auth
    ```

2.  **Configure:**
    *   Make sure you have the `hypo69-c32c8736ca62.json` file in the correct location (`gs.path.secrets`).  This file contains your Google Drive API credentials.

3.  **Example Usage:** Replace `/mnt/data/google_extracted/sample_file.txt` and `'My Drive Folder'` with the actual file path and folder name. Replace `/tmp/test.txt` in the `main` function with your actual file.  Run the script.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling within the `upload_file` method.
*   **Folder Creation:** Consider adding functionality to automatically create the folder in Google Drive if it doesn't already exist.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure that the Google Drive API credentials have the necessary permissions to upload files.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Google Drive has rate limits. Implement logic to handle these if you expect large-scale uploads.

This revised code is significantly more robust and useful than the previous example. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual file paths and credentials. Remember to handle errors gracefully in your production code.
