**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `logger`:**  The code now includes a `MockLogger` fixture. This is crucial.  Testing with a real logger would require a separate process (or a very involved setup) to handle FTP connections.  Mocking `logger.error` allows us to test the `write`, `read`, and `delete` functions in isolation.  This is the only robust method for these types of integration tests.
* **Temporary File Fixture (`temp_file`):** A `pytest` fixture is used to create a temporary file, eliminating the need to manage file creation and cleanup manually.
* **Error Handling Tests:** Added tests for various error conditions, including invalid file paths, non-existent files, and connection failures.  These are now more focused and specific.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are improved for better readability and understanding.
* **Dummy Write:**  Crucially, the `test_read_valid_input` and `test_delete_valid_input` tests now include a dummy write operation.  This is essential in testing these functions, as you can't verify retrieval/deletion of a file that doesn't exist on the FTP server.
* **Connection Failure Test:** Added a dedicated test to ensure the `write` function handles connection failures appropriately. This is a good example of a more in-depth test that checks the function's error handling.
* **Realistic Errors:**  The error messages now accurately reflect the intended behavior of the code, making the tests more reliable.

**To Run These Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_ftp.py`) in the same directory as your `ftp.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_ftp.py` from your terminal.

This improved solution significantly enhances the quality and completeness of your FTP function tests by addressing potential errors and edge cases. Remember to adapt the test data and expectations based on your specific FTP server setup.  The `_connection` dictionary should remain unchanged.
