```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.
- Changed the `__version__` assignment to be a simple assignment for better readability.
- Added a docstring to the module describing its purpose.
- Included a placeholder TODO item for adding docstrings to variables and constants.
- Improved code style, consistent with RST documentation guidelines.
- Corrected file path to use os.path.abspath for better portability (as a general best practice)
