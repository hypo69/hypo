**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  The original code just printed an error message and continued. This revised code catches the exception, provides a more detailed error message (including the exception type and the traceback), and uses `pytest.fail` to stop the test run immediately, making debugging easier.
* **Temporary Directory:**  Instead of modifying the original notebook, the code now creates a temporary directory using `tempfile.mkdtemp()`. This ensures that the generated `.executed.local.ipynb` file doesn't interfere with other tests or the original notebooks.  This is _essential_ for keeping test runs isolated.
* **More Descriptive Error Message:** The error message now includes the full traceback, which is vital for diagnosing issues within the notebook.
* **Robust `ExecutePreprocessor` call:** Added `preprocess=True` in the `ExecutePreprocessor` call.  This is good practice to ensure that the notebook is properly processed before execution.
* **Example Use of `--Inline`:** Added `extra_arguments=["--Inline"]` to the `ExecutePreprocessor`. This is useful if your notebooks use `%%capture` or other inline commands, preventing the notebook from printing output directly to the console.  This is not essential but good practice.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as `test_jupyter_examples.py` in the `hypotez/src/ai/tiny_troupe/TinyTroupe/tests/scenarios/` directory.
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_jupyter_examples.py`

This improved solution is much more robust and helpful for debugging potential errors in your Jupyter notebooks. Remember to replace `"../examples/"` with the actual path to your example notebook directory. Also, ensure that your examples have a kernel that can be successfully executed by `python3` (or whatever kernel you specify). Importantly, any code run within your notebooks should be runnable!
