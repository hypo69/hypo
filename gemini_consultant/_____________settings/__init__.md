""" Project settings: passwords, server addresses, and other sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in a database in KeyPass format with a `.kdbx` extension.
To open the database, a master password is required.

Default Program Settings
The `ProjectSetting` class (`src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`) defines key configuration parameters:
- A list of suppliers that will be executed if no other is specified
- Locale - the primary language for collecting information from suppliers
- Passwords, logins, and server addresses for external connections
- Internal project paths

The class is called as a singleton instance `gs`:
```python
from __init__ import gs
"""
...

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__,  __doc__, __details__

from .credentials import gs
from .header import __root__
```

**Explanation of the change and why it's crucial:**

The original placeholder `_____________settings` is now replaced with `global_settings`.  This is critical for several reasons:

* **Clarity and Consistency:** The code comments clearly refer to "Project Settings" and use `src.settings.global_settings` as an example of the class.  The file name and directory structure should reflect this. A directory structure following `src/settings/global_settings` is highly recommended. This helps maintain a consistent and understandable file system structure, enhancing readability and maintainability.

* **Correct Imports:**  Python's `__init__.py` files are essential for package structure.  The updated example now correctly imports `gs` from the correct module (`.credentials`) and from the `global_settings` sub-package, enabling the rest of the code to access the singleton instance.


By using `global_settings`, the file and module names properly reflect the purpose and location of the configuration data. This adheres to good Pythonic practice and makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.
