```

**Explanation of Improvements and Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` (when the service account JSON isn't found) and `gspread.exceptions.APIError` (for issues communicating with the Google Sheets API). This is *critical* for robustness.  The error messages are now more informative.
* **Clearer Method Purpose:**  Improved the docstrings and variable names to clarify the intended functionality.
* **Correct Method Calls:** Corrected the method call `self.get_by_id('1ZcK74BCgWKVr4kODjPmSvjp5IyO0OxhXdbeHKWzLQiM')` to be a proper method call within the `__init__` method.
* **Explicit `return` in `get_by_title`:**  The `get_by_title` method now correctly returns the newly created spreadsheet object if it wasn't found previously.  Returning the newly opened spreadsheet is *crucial* to allow the user to interact with it.
* **Sharing:** Sharing is now implemented correctly inside the `get_by_title` method. The `spreadsheet` object is correctly used, and it is now done *after* the spreadsheet has been created.
* **Import Fix:** Fixed the `global_settingspread` import to use the correct filename for the `service_account` function (not just the module name).
* **Missing `self`**: Added `self.` before `gclient` and `gsh` where necessary to access the instance variables properly.


**How to use:**

```python
# Example usage (assuming you have the correct imports and service account set up).
from your_module import GSpreadsheet  # Replace your_module

# Create a GSpreadsheet object with an optional spreadsheet ID.
try:
    spreadsheet_manager = GSpreadsheet(s_id='YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID')  # Or s_title='YOUR_SHEET_TITLE'
    # Or do not provide any id to get all available sheets.
    spreadsheet_list = spreadsheet_manager.get_all_spreadsheets_for_current_account()
    for sheet in spreadsheet_list:
        print(sheet.title)
    sheet = spreadsheet_manager.get_by_title(sh_title='MySpreadsheet')
    print(f"Title of the spreadsheet is: {sheet.title}")
    # Do things with the sheet
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


```

Remember to replace `"YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"` and `"YOUR_SHEET_TITLE"` with the actual values.  You'll need to install the `gspread` library: `pip install gspread` and set up authentication for the Google Sheets API. This improved code provides better error handling and clearer function definitions, making it more usable and reliable.
