# Therefore, the tests will focus on ensuring the rules are correctly applied.

# Instead, we will test the rules indirectly via examples and by verifying the general structure.
# This structure includes the presence of a global variable `MODE`, docstrings, and comments.

# Fixtures, if needed - none needed for this case
