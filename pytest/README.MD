# Testing Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the testing of the project.

## Structure

Each test set (`set 1`, `set 2`, ...) includes `.md` files that describe the scenarios and logic for the tests. The documentation files are organized according to the project's file structure, making it easy to navigate and understand the test hierarchy.

## Features

- All tests are written using the `pytest` framework.
- The file and directory structure of the documentation mirrors the project's structure to facilitate linking tests to the corresponding parts of the code.

## Usage

- Review the documentation in the corresponding test set before running tests.
- Use `pytest` to validate the functionality and integration of various project components.
