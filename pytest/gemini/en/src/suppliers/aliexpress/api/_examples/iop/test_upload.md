```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses mocking to avoid depending on external APIs or file systems for testing.  `MockIopClient` and `MockIopRequest` simulate the behavior of the actual classes, allowing us to control inputs and outputs. This is crucial for unit testing.

2. **Error Handling:** `test_upload_invalid_input` now correctly demonstrates how to test for an expected exception (`FileNotFoundError`).  The code now specifically handles the case where the file doesn't exist.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_upload_valid_input`, `test_upload_invalid_input`).

4. **Fixture for Request:** A `mock_request` fixture is created to help set up the request object more reliably and to avoid errors related to file paths. It also demonstrates how to handle file content for the `file_bytes` parameter.

5. **File Handling:** The example shows how to use a temporary directory (`tmp_path`) within the fixture so that the file is created and deleted.  Critically, the `open()` call is corrected to `open(mock_request.file_params, "rb").read()` so the file is opened in binary read mode, which is likely correct for the file bytes parameter.

6. **Edge Cases:** `test_upload_invalid_input` now correctly tests the case of an invalid file name.

7. **Robust Error Testing:** `test_upload_error_handling` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`).

8. **Complete Mock:** Added `mock_request` for more comprehensive mocking. This provides a much more complete and maintainable solution.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as `test_upload.py` (or whatever you choose).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_upload.py` in your terminal.

This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a more robust and practical set of tests that cover the most important aspects of the provided code. Remember to replace the placeholder `iop` module with your actual module if it's different. Also, ensure that `iop.IopResponse` is defined, or adjust the mock response accordingly.  The crucial step is to mock out the file operations and API calls to make the tests independent and fast.
