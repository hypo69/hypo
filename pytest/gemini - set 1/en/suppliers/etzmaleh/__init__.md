```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.etzmaleh import MODE, Graber


def test_mode_is_development():
    """Tests that the MODE is correctly set to 'development'."""
    assert MODE == 'development'


def test_graber_exists():
    """Tests that the Graber class is defined."""
    assert Graber is not None

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code was extremely simple, consisting only of a module definition and a constant.  The test cases reflect this, focusing on verifying the existence and value of the `MODE` constant and the presence of the `Graber` class.

**Important Considerations for Future Tests (if the code expands):**

If the `Graber` class had methods or attributes, the test suite would need to be expanded significantly.  For example:

```python
# Example if Graber had a method like fetch_data()
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.etzmaleh import MODE, Graber

# Example fixture (replace with appropriate fixture if needed)
@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}


def test_graber_fetch_data_valid_input(sample_data):
    """Tests that fetch_data works correctly with valid input."""
    graber = Graber()  # Instantiate the Graber object
    # ... (assert that the returned data from fetch_data matches expected behavior)
    assert graber.fetch_data(sample_data) == expected_data


def test_graber_fetch_data_invalid_input():
    """Tests that fetch_data handles invalid input."""
    graber = Graber()
    # ... (assert that fetch_data raises an exception or returns an appropriate error value)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        graber.fetch_data({"invalid": "data"})
    assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid input data"


# Example test for an edge case or boundary condition
def test_graber_fetch_data_empty_input():
    graber = Graber()
    result = graber.fetch_data({})
    assert result is None
```

**Key improvements for future tests:**

* **Fixture:** A fixture (`sample_data`) allows you to pass test data to the tests and keeps your tests cleaner and more organized.
* **Error Handling:**  The `with pytest.raises` context manager is used to test for expected exceptions.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Instead of just `assert graber.fetch_data(...)`, you should have assertions that check the *specific* values or properties of the returned data or the raised exception.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** The examples show how to test for various edge cases (empty input).

Remember to adapt these test examples to the actual methods and functionality of your `Graber` class.  The examples are crucial for understanding the correct way to design tests with `pytest`. Providing the full class definition would be needed to create a complete and meaningful test suite.
