```

**Changes Made**

- Added `pytest` import for testing framework.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error logging.
- Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added a placeholder test function `test_firefox_instance`.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) for the module and the function.
- Added a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions during test execution, logging errors using `logger.error`.
- Added placeholders (TODOs) for future test cases, fixture usage, assertions, and data handling examples.
- Converted all comments to reStructuredText format.
