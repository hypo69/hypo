# Example of how to test for exception handling (if any)
# This example assumes a function called 'my_function' that might raise an exception.

# def test_my_function_raises_exception_on_invalid_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         my_function(invalid_input)
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid input" # or whatever the exception message is.


# Replace these placeholder assertions with actual assertions based on the content of the SUPPORT.md file.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Placeholder Assertions:** The code now includes placeholder assertions (`assert True`) within the test functions.  This is crucial; you *must* replace these with actual assertions that check for specific content in the markdown file using string methods (e.g., `assert "GitHub Issues" in SUPPORT_text`).
* **No Input Code Provided:** The original response had to use placeholders because the necessary Python code wasn't available.  This revised solution highlights that without the actual Python functions to test, you can't write actual test cases.
* **Clear Test Descriptions:** The test function names are descriptive, clearly indicating the aspect of the markdown file being tested.
* **Example Exception Handling (commented out):**  I've included a commented-out example of how to test exception handling with `pytest.raises`.  Adapt this if your actual Python code throws exceptions that you need to handle in your tests.
* **Structure:** The test structure, with fixtures and test function organization, is suitable for integration into a larger testing suite.

**How to Use with Actual Code:**

1. **Replace the Placeholder Text:**  Replace the `# Placeholder for actual assertion.` comments with code that asserts specific things from the `SUPPORT.md` file.  For example, if the markdown says "GitHub Issues" under the heading, you'd check for that string.
2. **Add the Python Code:** Put the actual Python code (functions, classes) that you want to test into the `input_code` section.
3. **Adapt Fixtures:** If you have functions/methods in your Python code that require fixtures (e.g., to provide data), you will need to replace the example fixture with your own.

Only then will you have meaningful tests for the code.  As it stands, this is a template ready for when the Python code is included. Remember to import the markdown text as a string.  For example:

```python
import pytest
import markdown2 # or the module you are using to parse the markdown text.
# ... your other imports


def test_issue_tracking_method(example_data):
    # parse markdown here and get markdown text in a variable called SUPPORT_text
    # ...
    assert "GitHub Issues" in SUPPORT_text
```
