**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The `find_project_root` function now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if no marker files are found, preventing a silent failure.  The code now checks if `gtk_bin_path` exists before setting `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES`.  Crucially, it uses `sys.exit(1)` in error cases, which signals a non-zero exit code to the operating system, indicating an error.
* **`add_bin_paths` Function:** A new function encapsulates adding paths to `sys.path`, improving code organization. This function also prints informative messages when paths are added.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  Improved error messages to help users identify the source of issues (e.g., missing `settings.json`, incorrect paths).
* **Explicit Fallback:**  The code explicitly sets the `project_name` to the folder name if `settings.json` is not found or cannot be parsed, instead of relying on a potentially undefined variable.
* **`sys.exit(1)`:** Added `sys.exit(1)` in error blocks to make it clearer that the script should not continue executing if there are critical problems.


This revised code is more robust and provides better feedback to the user in case of issues. It's vital to handle potential errors in a production environment to prevent unexpected behavior. Remember to adjust `marker_files` if your project uses different markers. Remember to also validate file paths, and add logging if it is a production-level program.
