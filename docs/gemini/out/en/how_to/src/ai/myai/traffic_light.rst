How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a module named `traffic_light.py` within the `myai` package.  The code currently lacks a substantive description of its intended function.  It appears to be a placeholder or a starting point for a project related to traffic light simulation or control, potentially with an AI component.  The presence of `MODE = 'dev'` suggests it's intended for development or testing environments. The code includes numerous multiline strings (docstrings), but these are empty or incomplete. The comments direct users to external documentation (`https://habr.com/ru/articles/849414/`).


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code sets a variable `MODE` to the string `'dev'`.
2. The code contains several docstrings, which are comments used to document the module and its various parts. These docstrings are currently empty.
3. A comment indicates the need for a description of the module's operation, linking to an external article for potential guidance.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a placeholder, as the actual functionality is not defined.
    # To use this module, you would need to add the necessary functions and logic.

    # Example (IlluStartive only - Replace with appropriate import statements):
    import sys
    sys.path.append('path/to/your/hypotez/src/ai/myai')  # Adjust path as needed
    import traffic_light  # Assuming your module is named 'traffic_light'

    # Add your code to interact with the module here, but this will not execute
    # due to missing module implementation.

    print(traffic_light.MODE)  # Example of accessing the MODE variable.
