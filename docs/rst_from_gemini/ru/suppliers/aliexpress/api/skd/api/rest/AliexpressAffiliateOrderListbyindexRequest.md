    Represents a request to the AliExpress Affiliate API for retrieving

    Attributes:
        app_signature (str):  Application signature.
        end_time (str): End time for the order list query.  Format to be specified.
        fields (str): Specific fields to return in the response.  Format to be specified.
        page_size (int): Number of orders per page.
        start_query_index_id (str): Start query index ID.
        start_time (str): Start time for the order list query.  Format to be specified.
        status (str): Order status filter.  Format to be specified.
        domain (str): API domain (default: "api-sg.aliexpress.com").

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the class and methods.  These docstrings explain what the class and methods do, what the parameters are, and provide an example usage (though the example is illustrative and needs to be tailored to the actual API requirements).  This is crucial for maintainability and understanding the code.  It's important to specify the expected formats (e.g., date format) for parameters like `end_time` and `start_time` within the docstrings.  Similarly, specify the expected format of the `fields` parameter.

* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved formatting and structure for better readability.

* **Example Usage (Illustrative):**  Included a placeholder example demonstrating how the class might be used.  Crucially, this is just a template and you need to replace placeholder values with the correct API usage details, including data types and formats.

* **Parameter Information:** Docstrings clearly state the expected type of each parameter and its purpose.


**Next Steps (Crucial):**

* **Replace Placeholders:** Update the example usage and docstrings with the actual expected formats and data types for each parameter based on the AliExpress Affiliate API documentation. This is critical for the class to work correctly.  Be very careful about the datatypes needed, especially date formats, when filling this in.

* **API Documentation:** Carefully review the AliExpress Affiliate API documentation to understand the exact parameters, their expected values, and return structure.  This is absolutely essential for accurate implementation.

* **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully manage potential API errors and exceptions.

* **Response Handling:** Implement the logic to parse the response from the API and return the relevant data in a usable format. The response likely won't be a simple string.  You'll need code to deserialize the data coming back from the API.


This improved version provides much more context and makes the code more maintainable and usable.  Crucially, it emphasizes the need for detailed understanding of the specific API requirements to complete the implementation. Remember to consult the AliExpress Affiliate API documentation for precise implementation details.
