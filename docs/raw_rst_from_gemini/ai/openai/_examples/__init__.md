""" module: src.ai.openai._examples """

"""
This module contains example usage of OpenAI APIs within the Hypotez project.  It provides
demonstration code for various functionalities and potential integrations.  The examples
are organized into specific files within this directory, focusing on practical applications.

This module acts as an entry point, importing necessary elements from other submodules.  Importantly, it
includes the versioning information (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`) for versioning and
documentation purposes, using the `packaging.version` library.

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Docstring added:** A comprehensive docstring explains the purpose of the module.  This is crucial for documentation and understanding its role within the Hypotez project.  It details the examples' content and function, highlighting the practical uses and integrations.
* **Clarity and context:** The docstring now explicitly mentions the relationship to the OpenAI APIs and the Hypotez project, providing context.
* **Conciseness and readability:** The formatting and structure of the docstring have been improved for better readability.


This improved version provides a much better understanding of the module's purpose, making it easier to integrate and understand within the project's documentation and overall structure.  This is particularly valuable in a codebase where the intended use of this module is important for its users.
