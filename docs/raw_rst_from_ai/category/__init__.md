**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:**  The code now includes docstrings for functions (`get_category_version`, `get_category_doc`, `get_category_details`, `get_category_list`). This is crucial for documentation generation tools (like Sphinx) and improves code readability.  The docstring for `get_category_list` is more comprehensive, including parameter description and potential error handling.

* **Error Handling:** The `get_category_list` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions during the `crawl_categories` function call. This prevents the script from crashing if there's a problem with the website or the crawling process. It now prints an informative error message and returns `None` indicating failure.  This is a *vital* addition.

* **Helper functions:** Added `get_category_version`, `get_category_doc`, and `get_category_details`.  These allow users of the module to access the version and other important details without having to look up the module's internals. This is a good best practice.

* **Clearer Purpose:** The docstrings more clearly indicate the purpose of each function and how it is intended to be used.


**How to use this improved code:**

```python
from hypotez.src.category import get_category_list

# Example usage
url = "your_prestashop_url"  # Replace with the actual URL
categories = get_category_list(url)

if categories:
    for category in categories:
        print(category.name)  # Or whatever you want to do with the category object
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve categories.")
```

This revised code is significantly more useful and robust, making it easier to use and integrate into other parts of the project. Remember to replace `"your_prestashop_url"` with the actual URL.  Crucially, it helps prevent issues caused by unexpected errors in `crawl_categories`. Remember to adapt the `print` statements and handling of `categories` (e.g., error handling) to fit the specific requirements of your project. Remember to also add the necessary error handling and data validation to your `crawl_categories` function itself, as this is the function that will be responsible for fetching the data and potentially dealing with errors from the external website. Remember to make these changes as appropriate for your specific needs.
