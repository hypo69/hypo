""" TODO:
- Add more robust error handling for invalid input data in create_user().

```

```
- Added Sphinx-style docstrings to the `process_data` function, including `Args`, `Returns`, and `Example` sections.
- Added a complete example of a Pydantic model (`User`) and its corresponding function (`create_user`) with clear docstrings demonstrating handling Pydantic models.
- Created a `TODO` section at the end of the file to suggest potential future improvements.
- Corrected string literal use in the docstrings to use single quotes.
- Existing comments (if any) are retained with a remark indicating potential redundancy in the comments.
