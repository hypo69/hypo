```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Mock Data:** The `mock_project_root` fixture creates a temporary directory structure mirroring a real project with the necessary files, making tests more reliable. This also eliminates reliance on external files, ensuring the tests run independently.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test names are now more descriptive and explicitly test specific scenarios like valid inputs, missing files, and marker files in parent directories.

3. **Exception Handling:**  The code now includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` using `pytest.raises`. This is crucial for robustness and to check the exception handling in the original code.

4. **`monkeypatch` for Testing `gs`:** The `test_settings_retrieval_file_not_found` test now uses `monkeypatch` to simulate a situation where `gs.path` is not available.

5. **`tmp_path` fixture:** Uses the `tmp_path` fixture for creating temporary directories, which is standard practice for pytest.

6. **File Existence Checks:** Added assertions to verify that the created files actually exist within the temporary directory. This ensures that the fixtures are working as expected.

7. **Import `sys`:** The `sys` module is imported in the test file to allow testing the `sys.path` modification.

8. **Import `gs`:** Imports `gs` from the correct path. The module is imported only in the tests.

9. **Global Variable Tests:** Added tests for the assignment of global variables (__project_name__, __version__, etc.) to check that they are correctly initialized.


This revised solution addresses the prompt's requirements, provides more robust and reliable tests, and demonStartes best practices for writing `pytest` tests. Remember to adjust the import paths if your project structure differs. Remember to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
