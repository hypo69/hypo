**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`proposition_holds` placeholder:**  The original test relied on `proposition_holds` which is not defined in the provided code. The test now includes a crucial check to ensure `proposition_holds` is defined in the `testing_utils` module.  This is *critical* for testing, as if `proposition_holds` doesn't exist, the tests won't run correctly.
* **Explicit Error Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` for `ValueError` and `TypeError` to specifically check for exceptions related to empty or incorrect input types.  The tests now check the exception messages, which is good practice.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_generate_person_valid_spec`).
* **Realistic Input for Edge Cases:** Added a `test_generate_person_long_spec` test to check for handling of very long descriptions.  This is important since a long string could cause problems.

**How to Use:**

1. **`testing_utils`:** Ensure the `testing_utils` module (containing `proposition_holds`) is present and functional.

2. **Run the Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests in the usual way (e.g., `pytest test_factory.py`).

This revised solution addresses critical issues like `proposition_holds` existence and error handling, making it more robust and reliable.  Remember to adapt the `testing_utils` part if your module has different functions/setup.  Critically, if `proposition_holds` doesn't return a Boolean value that indicates the description is valid, the assertion should be adjusted appropriately.
