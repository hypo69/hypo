```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the input and expected outcome (e.g., `test_rai_copyright_infringement_prevention_valid_request_book`).

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover different types of copyrighted material (books, lyrics, recipes, news, WebMD).

3. **Edge Cases:** Added a test for an empty request and an invalid input type (integer) to demonstrate robustness.  This addresses the potential for unexpected user input.

4. **Expected Response Consistency:**  The `expected_response` string is now more consistent across all tests, including clarifying examples (e.g.,  "I cannot violate copyright laws").

5. **Placeholder Function:**  Critically, a placeholder function `rai_copyright_infringement_prevention` is included.  This is **essential** for testing;  replace this with the actual function from your provided code.  The tests now use the placeholder function.

6. **pytest Assertions:**  Uses `assert` statements to check the equality of the function's return value to the expected result.

7. **Error Handling (Crucial):**  The placeholder function now includes a basic check for an empty input request.  In a real-world scenario, you would have more robust error handling and possibly raise exceptions for truly invalid inputs.  This is just a starting point, and a better version would use more sophisticated checking.


**How to use:**

1. Replace the placeholder function `rai_copyright_infringement_prevention` with your actual code.
2. Run the tests using `pytest`.


This improved solution addresses the issues in the original response, providing a more comprehensive and robust set of tests. Remember to adapt the placeholder function and the tests to the specifics of your actual code. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual code and input validation. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
