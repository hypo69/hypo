**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial improvement is mocking the `Driver` class and the functions within `Graber`. This is essential for testing `grab_page` because it's asynchronous and interacts with external resources (the driver).  Mocking avoids actual interactions with the browser, which can be slow and unreliable in testing.

2. **Asynchronous Testing:** `test_grab_page_valid_input` demonstrates how to use `loop.run_until_complete` to properly run asynchronous code within a pytest test.  The `loop.close()` is added for proper cleanup.  This is critical for asynchronous tests.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** The tests now have more descriptive names (e.g., `test_grab_page_missing_function_call`), making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

4. **Edge Cases:** Added `test_grab_page_missing_function_call` and `test_grab_page_empty_input` to test scenarios where functions might not be called properly or return empty data. This is better than just testing with valid inputs.

5. **Robustness:** The tests no longer rely on global variables; instead, the `graber` fixture ensures that each test has its own independent instance of `Graber`.

6. **Exception Handling (Important):**  The example now includes a test that checks for the correct handling of cases where a function inside `grab_page` raises an exception, though this is not explicitly handled in the original code.  You'd want to add error handling into the `graber` methods (e.g., `try...except` blocks) and then test that error handling mechanism.

7. **Comments:**  Clear comments explain the logic of each test case.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Completeness:** The provided example code in the `Graber` class contains many functions. The tests provided cover only a subset of those methods (those specifically tested).   Expand these tests to thoroughly cover all relevant functions, including edge cases and error handling where appropriate.
* **Real Data (If Possible):**  If possible, use a small sample of realistic data in the tests.
* **`ProductFields`:**  Make sure you have a proper definition for the `ProductFields` class.  If it's not included, update the tests accordingly.


To run these tests, you'll need to have `pytest` installed.  Make sure your file structure and import paths are correct.  If you get errors about the `src` directory or other modules, adjust accordingly. Remember to replace placeholders with actual `src` package content. Remember to uncomment the appropriate decorator tests if you are testing the decorator. Remember to adjust tests for the relevant functions that are called within `grab_page` (e.g. `id_product`, etc.). Remember to create the corresponding mock objects (like `ProductFields`, etc.). Remember to replace any other placeholders with relevant definitions or mocks, especially any necessary fixture classes (e.g. `ProductFields`).


Example of testing a specific function within `Graber`, say `id_product`:
```python
# ... (other imports and fixtures)

def test_id_product(graber, driver):
    # Mock the relevant parts of the driver
    driver.execute_locator = Mock(return_value=asyncio.Future())
    id_product_future = asyncio.Future()
    id_product_future.set_result(123)  # Mock a result
    graber.id_product = Mock(return_value=id_product_future)


    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    future = loop.run_until_complete(graber.grab_page(driver)) # or a specific id_product call
    assert future.id_product == 123
    loop.close()
```
