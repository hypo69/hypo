**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now accurately describe the purpose of each test.

2. **Example Fixtures:** Added a basic `example_prestashop` fixture.  Crucially, **replace this with appropriate fixtures** if the classes in your code require initialization with data.

3. **Example Tests:** Demonstrated tests for `PrestaShop` creation and `MODE` verification.  Critical: **Expand these tests to cover methods, attributes, and interactions of each class.**

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Added tests for other classes (`PrestaCategory`, etc.) to demonstrate a more complete test suite.

5. **Exception Handling (Example):** Included a `test_invalid_mode` to show how to test for exceptions.  **Replace this example** with actual tests for exceptions that might be raised by methods in your code.

6. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to describe the purpose of each test function.


**How to use and extend:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  The example `example_prestashop` fixture and the placeholder exception are just examples. Replace these with actual fixtures and tests based on the logic and expected behavior of the `hypotez.src.endpoints` module's classes.

* **Specific test cases:** Add tests that check the *specific* methods and attributes of the classes.  For example, if `PrestaShop` has a `get_products()` method, write a test that verifies its correct functionality with different inputs (valid, empty, etc.).

* **Input validation:**  Write tests that verify the code handles invalid input (e.g., incorrect data types, missing parameters) appropriately.  These are critical to catching potential bugs.

* **Edge Cases:**  Consider edge cases for each method (e.g., empty lists, large datasets, boundary conditions).


By implementing the above improvements, you can create a more robust and effective set of test cases to guarantee the correctness of your `hypotez.src.endpoints` module. Remember to thoroughly understand the functionality of each class and method before writing the tests.
