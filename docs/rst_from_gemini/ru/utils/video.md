Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.  It includes error handling and logging for robust operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Handles file not found and read errors.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')  # or None if failed

    >>> data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Key improvements:**

* **More Robust Error Handling:**  The `save_video_from_url` function now includes `try...except` blocks to catch `aiohttp.ClientError` (for network issues) and other general exceptions.  Critically, it checks if the file actually exists and has non-zero size *after* the download attempt.
* **Clearer Logging:**  Uses f-strings for more informative error messages.  Includes `exc_info=True` in the `logger.error` calls to provide stack traces for debugging.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints for better code readability and maintainability.
* **Example Usage (main):** Demonstrates how to use the function and handle the potential `None` return value.
* **Example URL:** Included a placeholder for a valid URL (replace with a proper video URL).
* **Handles 0-byte files:** Now explicitly returns `None` if the downloaded file is empty.
* **Docstring Improvements:**  More detailed docstrings, including examples of how to use the functions and what to expect if something goes wrong.


This revised code is significantly more robust and useful in a real-world application. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiofiles
```
