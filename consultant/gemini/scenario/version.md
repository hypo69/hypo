```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Error Handling:** The crucial change is replacing `...` with `pass`. This is critical.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the `try...except` block now gracefully handles the error and prevents the script from crashing.  This makes the code much more robust.  The previous version would raise an exception and stop the entire program.


2. **Variable Naming:** Python style guides generally prefer `snake_case` for variables, making the code more readable. While `__version__` is a common convention for versioning, the rest should be snake_case.  For example, `__cofee__` should be `__coffee__`.


3. **`__copyright__` Spelling:**  Corrected the typo in `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.


4. **Conciseness:** The `if settings` part is repeated in several lines.  While the previous version is functionally correct, it's slightly better to write it a bit more concisely using the `if settings` block once.


**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "hypotez_project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024 Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```

**Why these changes are important for `code_checker`:**

* **Reliability:**  The error handling means the `code_checker` will not fail if `settings.json` is not found or formatted incorrectly. This is vital for production code.
* **Maintainability:** The code is now more readable and easier to maintain, especially if you need to extend it in the future.
* **Robustness:** The code is more resilient to unexpected situations, which is highly desired for any program that might be used by others (or even used in a larger system).

By addressing these issues, the code is significantly improved and becomes more suitable for use in a real-world scenario. Remember to replace the example `settings.json` values with your actual values.  Crucially, test thoroughly to ensure that the code works correctly in a variety of conditions. This is something every `code_checker` should verify.
