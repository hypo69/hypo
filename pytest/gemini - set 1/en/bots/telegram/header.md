**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests now cover valid input (with a temporary file), situations where the marker file isn't found, and relative paths, which were missing in the initial response.  Crucially, they also test the critical case of the marker file not being present at all.

2. **Edge Case Testing:**  The `test_get_project_root_marker_not_found` test ensures the function returns the current directory when the expected marker files are absent. This is a critical edge case to consider.  The `test_get_project_root_relative_path` test checks the expected behavior with the marker files in a subdirectory.

3. **Error Handling Tests:**  The new tests (`test_settings_file_not_found` and `test_settings_file_invalid_json`) address the exception handling in the `settings` loading. They make sure the code doesn't crash if the file is missing or if the JSON is invalid.

4. **Clarity and Readability:** Test function names are more descriptive, and comments explain the purpose of each test and the simulated scenario.


5. **Robustness:** The code now includes the `temp_dir` cleanup using `shutil.rmtree` to prevent leftover files after running the tests. This is essential for ensuring clean test runs.

6. **Contextual Tests (settings loading):** The tests related to `settings` loading (e.g., `test_settings_file_not_found`, `test_settings_file_invalid_json`) are crucial and have been added.  However, they are designed as *examples* because running them effectively needs the actual context of `settings.json` being present.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the tests as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger_header.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run pytest from your terminal in the directory containing the test file: `pytest test_logger_header.py`


**Important Note:**  For the tests related to `settings.json`, you'll need to create a temporary `settings.json` file with valid or invalid JSON to simulate the real-world scenarios. Remember to create/remove temporary files for accurate testing (like in `test_get_project_root_valid_input`).


This revised set of tests is more complete and robust, providing more comprehensive coverage of the functionality of `get_project_root` and the settings loading. Remember to adjust the paths in the tests if the location of your test files or `settings.json` is different.
