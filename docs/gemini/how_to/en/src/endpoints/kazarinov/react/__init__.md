## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/react/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/react/__init__.py`, initializes the Kazarinzov React endpoint for generating pricelists in PDF and HTML formats.

**Key Concepts:**

* **`ReportGenerator`:** A class responsible for generating the pricelists.  This is imported from the `pricelist_generator` module within the same directory.

**How to use:**

1. **Import the necessary components:**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.react import ReportGenerator
```

2. **Instantiate a `ReportGenerator` object:**  This is where you'd supply the data required for generating the report.  Crucially, the specifics of instantiating `ReportGenerator` are *not* provided in the given code snippet.  You will need the necessary documentation for the `ReportGenerator` class itself.  Example:

```python
# Example, needs to be adapted to your specific data
my_generator = ReportGenerator(data_source='my_data_file.csv', output_format='pdf') 
```

3. **Generate the report:**  The exact method for generating the report (e.g., `generate_report()`, `run()`, `create_report()`) is again dependent on the `ReportGenerator` class itself, so refer to its documentation.  Example:


```python
# Example, needs to be adapted to your specific data and method.
my_generator.generate_report() 
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely controls the mode of operation (development vs. production).  Adapt your code to handle this setting as needed.

* **Data Source:**  The `ReportGenerator` likely requires input data (e.g., from a CSV file, database, or API). The code snippet only hints at this; you must examine the `pricelist_generator.py` file to see how `ReportGenerator` accepts and processes data.

* **Output Format:**  The expected output format (PDF or HTML) is set via the `output_format` parameter, as demonstrated in the example.

* **Error Handling:**  The provided code doesn't include error handling. You should add `try...except` blocks to gracefully catch and handle potential errors during data processing or report generation.


**Example Usage Scenario (Illustrative):**

```python
# ... (import statements and data setup)

try:
    generator = ReportGenerator(data_source='pricelist_data.csv', output_format='pdf')
    generator.generate_report()
    print("Report generated successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error generating report: {e}")

```


**Next Steps:**

You need to consult the `hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/react/pricelist_generator.py` file to understand the complete API (methods, parameters, etc.) of the `ReportGenerator` class.  This will clarify how to effectively use the `ReportGenerator` to generate the desired pricelists and handle potential errors.
