**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function for testing different scenarios.  This is crucial for isolating the `set_project_root` function and ensuring that external files aren't affected.  Crucially, the mocking now prepares `settings.json` content so the loading process can be tested.


2. **Comprehensive Tests:** The test cases now cover various conditions:
   - Valid `marker_files` leading to correct root directory retrieval
   -  No `marker_files` found (no exception thrown in this case, as stated in the function documentation).
   - `FileNotFoundError` in `settings.json` (properly tests the `try/except` block)
   - `JSONDecodeError` in `settings.json` (proper handling for invalid JSON).  


3. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive, making it easier to understand the test's purpose and identify failures.

4. **Correct Error Handling:**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to verify the `try/except` blocks within the original code.  This ensures you are testing the exception handling functionality.

5. **Edge Case:** The test covers the case where `settings` is `None` so the function is more robust.


6. **Isolated Tests:** Each test is independent and doesn't rely on the state of previous tests.

7. **Fixtures (if needed):** If the code used fixtures in the original file, the corresponding fixture definitions would be provided.

8. **Setup and Teardown (important for mocking):** Mocks for the `open` function are used in the tests to control the environment.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing `test_header.py` and the `hypotez/src/bots/openai_bots/header.py` file.


This revised solution is a significant improvement, addressing the potential issues and providing a more comprehensive and reliable test suite. Remember to adapt the mock paths and data as needed for your actual project structure.
