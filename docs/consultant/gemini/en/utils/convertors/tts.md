**Changes Made**

- Replaced `jjson.load` with `src.utils.jjson.j_loads` and `src.utils.jjson.j_loads_ns` as instructed.
- Added missing imports for `Path`, `tempfile`, and the necessary libraries.
- Improved the error handling using `logger.error` with descriptive messages.
- Corrected the use of f-strings for better readability.
- Added reStructuredText (RST) documentation for functions, methods, and classes.
- Improved the variable names to be more descriptive.
- Added detailed error messages for exceptions.
- Docstrings comply with Python docstring standards (e.g., for Sphinx).
- Changed the return value of `speech_recognizer` to be more informative.
- Changed the return value of `text2speech` to be more informative.
- Modified the handling of `audio_url` to be more robust.
