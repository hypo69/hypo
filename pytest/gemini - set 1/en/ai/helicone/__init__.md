```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_module_exists`:** This is a crucial addition.  It checks that the file actually exists.  This prevents your tests from failing mysteriously if the file is missing or in a different location.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names now clearly state the purpose of each test.

3. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed Here):**  Since there's no actual function to raise exceptions, the `pytest.raises` is removed.


4. **`assert MODE is not None`:** A more robust way to check if the variable exists and is not None.

5. **Import from Module:** Corrected the imports to access the `MODE` constant.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`

2.  Save the test code above as `test_helicone.py` (or a similar name).

3.  Save the provided `hypotez/src/ai/helicone.py` file in the correct folder structure.

4.  Run the tests from the directory containing `test_helicone.py` using:
   ```bash
   pytest test_helicone.py
   ```

**Crucial Next Step:**

You **absolutely** need to add the actual Python code that defines the `helicone` module's functions/classes to complete this testing process.  These tests are checking the *existence* and *type* of `MODE` and the *module itself*; you'll need to have your `hypotez` code to write proper unit tests for the *behaviour* of that module.


Example of `hypotez/src/ai/helicone.py` if this needed a function:


```python
def get_mode():
    return MODE
```


And then corresponding test functions in your `test_helicone.py`:


```python
def test_get_mode():
    from hypotez.src.ai.helicone import get_mode
    assert get_mode() == 'development'
```
