How to use the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`, is responsible for initializing the project's root path and loading settings.  It's crucial for ensuring all imports work correctly relative to the project's structure.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Project Root Determination:** The `set_project_root` function finds the root directory of the project.  It searches upwards from the current file's location, looking for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). This ensures that the code works even if the file is run from different parts of the project.
* **Settings Loading:** The module loads settings from a `settings.json` file located within the project's `src` directory. It handles potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid JSON) gracefully.
* **Documentation Loading:**  It also tries to load documentation from a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory.  This provides contextual information about the project.
* **Global Variables:** The module defines several global variables (`__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.) populated from the settings and documentation files, making these values easily accessible throughout the project.

**How to Use:**

1. **Import the Module:**
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.logger.header import __root__, __project_name__  # or other variables
   ```

2. **Using the Project Root:**
   You can now use the `__root__` variable to construct file paths relative to the project root, as shown in the provided example. This is essential for accessing files and resources consistently.

   ```python
   import os
   file_path = os.path.join(str(__root__), "data", "my_file.txt")
   ```

3. **Accessing Project Metadata:**
   Use variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, and `__doc__` to retrieve project-specific information.

   ```python
   print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
   print(f"Version: {__version__}")
   print(f"Documentation: {__doc__}")
   ```

**Error Handling:**

The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during the settings and documentation loading process.  This ensures the rest of the script doesn't crash if these files are missing or improperly formatted. The `...` placeholder indicates a place for handling missing files; in production code, you might want to log the error or use default values.

**Important Considerations:**

* **File Structure:**  Ensure that your project directory structure matches the expected path (`gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json'`).
* **`gs` Module:** The code imports a `gs` module.  This module (likely from the same project) is necessary for the `gs.path.root` variable.  You need to ensure that the `gs` module is defined and available in your project.
* **Python Version:** The shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`) specify the Python interpreter for the script. This is crucial for correct execution.
