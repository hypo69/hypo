# ... (add more tests as needed)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better reflect the input conditions.
* **Mocking `__file__`:** Crucially, the `__file__` is mocked using `patch("builtins.__file__", ...)` to correctly simulate the file's location within the test environment.  This is *essential* for proper project root detection.
* **Mocking `sys.path`:**
   - The original code directly modifies `sys.path`, which is generally not good practice in tests.  Now, `sys.path` is not modified directly. Instead, we use `pytest.importorskip` to skip tests when `gs` is not found.
   - The example now checks for `__root__` being in `sys.path`.
* **Handling Missing Files:** Tests now explicitly handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might not exist.  The tests for these cases were missing, and it was assumed they would work.
* **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** Added more thorough tests for various scenarios including no `pyproject.toml` or when the marker files are located in parent directories.
* **Mocking `settings.json`:**   Created a `mock_settings` fixture to create a mock `settings.json` file easily. This is preferable to hardcoding the file path in your tests.
* **Using `pytest.raises` for Errors:**  The code now includes `pytest.raises` for the error handling in `settings` and `doc_str` loading, to verify that expected errors are caught.
* **Parameterization:** The `test_project_name` is parametrized to test various `settings_data` inputs.
* **Using `tmp_path` fixture:**  The `mock_settings_file` fixture uses `tmp_path` to create temporary files in a controlled manner.  This is a best practice to avoid conflicts with existing files.
* **Import `sys`:** Added the `import sys` statement because it's used in the `set_project_root` function.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Install `pytest` (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


This improved set of tests is much more robust and comprehensive in verifying the functionality of the `header.py` code. Remember to adjust the file paths (`TEST_FILE`, etc.) to match your actual project structure. Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual tests for the other functions.
