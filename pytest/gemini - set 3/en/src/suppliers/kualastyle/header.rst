**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, cases where marker files are not found, and edge cases related to directory structures.

2. **Error Handling:**  Crucially, a test `test_set_project_root_exception` is added to handle the `FileNotFoundError` case, as the original code did not explicitly check for this. This is vital for robustness.

3. **Dummy File Creation and Removal:** The tests now create and remove dummy files to avoid polluting the test environment.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific, confirming the expected types and properties of the `root_path`.

5. **Fixture (Optional):**  A fixture to create and manage test data isn't strictly needed for this function as the tests are primarily checking paths and file existence. However, I kept the example fixture structure for completeness in case the actual code requires additional data to execute.

6. **`gs.path` handling:** The `gs.path` part of the original code is incomplete, so I've added a placeholder test (`test_settings_loading`). You'll need to replace the dummy assertion with actual checks against the `gs.path.root` object if you have it.  The crucial part is verifying that `gs.path.root` is populated and points to the correct directory.  This test now assumes a `gs` module exists and is available for the tests.


**Before Running the Tests:**

*   **Replace placeholders:** If you have a `gs` module, complete the `test_settings_loading` function (as explained in the code comments).
*   **Create a directory structure:**  If necessary, create the directory structure expected by `set_project_root` for your test cases, especially the `src` directory and `settings.json` file if you use this example.
*   **Install `pytest`:** If you haven't already, install `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual behavior of your `gs` module and the expected structure of your project's file system.  If a `gs` module is absent from the given code, the `test_settings_loading` will not work correctly.
