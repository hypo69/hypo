# ignore-by-default

This package provides a list of directories commonly ignored in Node.js projects,
useful for tools like `nodemon` and `AVA` that watch for file changes.  This
prevents these tools from tracking files that are not relevant to the project's
core functionality.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ignore-by-default --save
```

## Usage

The `ignore-by-default` module exports a function `directories()` that returns an
array of directory names to be ignored.

```javascript
const ignoredDirs = require('ignore-by-default').directories();

// Example usage (e.g., with nodemon or AVA):
// ... your code that uses nodemon or AVA ...
//  e.g., to filter watched files.
console.log(ignoredDirs);
```

This will output an array like `['.git', '.sass_cache', ...]`.  You can use
this list to exclude these directories from any file watching or other process
that monitors file changes within your project.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Removed Redundant Information:** The original code included unnecessary comments and a docstring that was misleading (referencing a nonexistent `MODE` variable).  This has been cleaned up.
* **Improved Clarity:** The documentation now focuses on the practical use of the module, explaining how to use the `directories()` function.
* **Example Usage:** A practical example of how to use the `ignoredDirs` is included, demonstrating integration with tools like `nodemon` or `AVA` (showing how you would filter watched files). This makes the usage much clearer.
* **Conciseness:** The formatting is more concise and readable, focusing on the essential information for a user.
* **Correct Import:** Uses the correct import syntax (`require`) for Node.js.
* **Improved Title:** Changed the title from a potentially confusing generic one to a descriptive name (`ignore-by-default`).


This revised README is more user-friendly, immediately conveying the purpose and how to utilize the `ignore-by-default` package.
