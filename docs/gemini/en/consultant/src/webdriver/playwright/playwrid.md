# Changes Made

- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) for the `Playwrid` class, `_load_settings`, `_set_launch_options`, and `start` method, adhering to Sphinx standards.
- Replaced vague comments with specific terms.
- Incorporated `logger.error` for error handling, especially in the `_load_settings` method to handle potential file loading issues.
- Added `try...except` blocks around file loading (`_load_settings`) to gracefully handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions and log errors properly.
- Added type hints where applicable.
- Renamed `playwrid.py` to `playwrid.py` (no change in filename).
- Improved logging messages for clarity and debugging.
- Added robustness by checking for `hasattr` before accessing attributes in settings.
- Improved variable names and added descriptive comments.
