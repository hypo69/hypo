**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` class.  This is crucial for unit testing since you're dealing with asynchronous operations and external dependencies (web driver).  This avoids actual web interactions during testing, speeding things up and making the tests more reliable.  The mocks provide predictable inputs (crucial!) so the tests can be expected to reliably pass or fail.

* **Asynchronous Testing:** The `asyncio.run()` function is used to run the asynchronous methods correctly.

* **Explicit Assertions:**  More specific assertions (e.g., `assert isinstance(fields, ProductFields)`) are added to verify the expected data types and structures returned.  The example assertions are very basic; you need to adapt these to match *your* `ProductFields` structure and expected data.

* **Edge Case Tests:** Tests are added to cover cases where elements might not be found, or are None, or an exception is raised, showing how to use `pytest.raises`. This addresses the key requirement of edge cases.


* **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are more descriptive and follow a consistent pattern (`test_grab_page_valid_input`).


* **Method-Specific Tests:** Added `test_id_product_valid_input`, `test_id_product_invalid_input`, and `test_description_short_valid_input`  as *examples* to show how to write tests for individual methods. Remember to create similar tests for all the other methods in your `Graber` class.

**Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Adapt `ProductFields` Assertions:** Replace the placeholder assertions (e.g., `assert fields is None`) with actual assertions based on the structure and expected data of the `ProductFields` dataclass.
2. **Complete Method Tests:**  Add tests for every method in the `Graber` class, covering valid, invalid, and edge cases.
3. **Fixture for `fields`:** Consider a fixture to create the `ProductFields` dataclass instance and ensure it's populated before the tests, so all the tests do not have to manually make a call to the respective functions.
4. **Detailed Mock Data:**  Crucially, specify the expected return values for all your mock functions.   This means you have to know what the functions *should* return in each case to assert the proper behavior.

By following these steps, you'll have a robust test suite that thoroughly covers your `Graber` class. Remember to thoroughly think through the *inputs* (what is passed to the function in the tests) that are needed to successfully and reliably test the output.
