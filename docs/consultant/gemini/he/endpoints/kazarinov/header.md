```
Changes Made
```

- Added missing `import` statement for `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement for error handling.
- Improved error handling:  Replaced `...` with `logger.error` statements to log errors during file loading and provide more informative messages.
- Added default values for `settings` and `doc_str` in case of errors, to prevent crashes.  This is crucial for robustness.
- Updated `__doc__` to be a more descriptive RST style docstring for the module.
- Added `:param`, `:type`, `:raises`, `:return`, and `:rtype` tags to the docstring of `get_project_root` for better readability and compliance with Python docstring standards.
- Added more comprehensive error handling with `try...except` blocks for `settings.json` and `README.MD`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` as per the requirement.
- Renamed the variable `__root__` to `PROJECT_ROOT` for clarity and consistency.
- Added type hints where applicable for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Updated docstrings for better readability and compliance with RST standards.
