**Explanation of Improvements and Added Tests:**

* **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for empty input (`empty_prod_urls`) to `check_and_process_affiliate_products` and `process_affiliate_products`. This is crucial for robustness.
* **Edge Case for Invalid URL:** Included `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_url` to demonstrate how to test for exceptions raised by the `retrieve_product_details` method when given a malformed URL.  This uses `pytest.raises` to assert the correct exception type and message.
* **Clearer and More Descriptive Test Names:**  Improved the names to better reflect the test conditions.
* **Mocking `ensure_https`:** The original test lacked mocking for the `ensure_https` function.  This has been fixed.
* **Assertion for `retrieve_product_details` call count:**  The test for `test_process_affiliate_products_valid_input` now verifies that `retrieve_product_details` was called exactly once with the provided URL list.
* **Verification of mocking side effects:** The `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_url` correctly utilizes `mock_retrieve.side_effect` to simulate the exception scenario.
* **Mocking `save_png_from_url` and `save_video_from_url`:**  Tests are more thorough by verifying that these functions were called.


This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive test suite, covering various scenarios, including valid input, empty input, and critical edge cases like invalid URLs. Remember to replace `"src.suppliers.aliexpress.affiliated_products_generator"` with the actual path if necessary. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
