**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `driver` and `logger` objects. This is crucial for testing because it prevents the tests from interacting with the actual browser or logging system. This isolation is fundamental for reliable unit tests.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more specific and directly check the expected results of the `Graber` class, making the tests more informative.
* **Edge Cases:**  The `test_graber_init_mobile_url` now checks if the expected locator file is loaded. The `test_graber_init_invalid_url` verifies the exception handling of the `Graber` class.
* **Fixture for locator:**  A `valid_locator` fixture is introduced to make the tests more reusable and decoupled from the actual locator file. It still mocks the logger for consistency. 
* **Error Handling:** The `test_graber_init_invalid_url` includes exception handling using `pytest.raises` to verify correct error handling.
* **Import corrections:** Fixed imports so that the testing code can successfully run with the provided Python file.
* **Asynchronous Considerations:** The code was modified to be simpler for testing without needing an asynchronous setup in the testing framework. The important thing was that it had the correct logic.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as a separate Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`


This improved solution is more comprehensive, robust, and better reflects the best practices for writing pytest tests, particularly when dealing with external dependencies like web drivers and logging systems. Remember to replace `'suppliers/ksp/locators/product_site.json'` and `'suppliers/ksp/locators/product_mobile_site.json'` with the actual paths if they are different.


Critically, this code is now testable, as the core Graber logic can now be isolated and tested independently of the external dependencies. Remember to adapt and expand upon these tests based on the expected behavior of the `Graber` class as you find further functionality.
