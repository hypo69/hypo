```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling. The tests now include `pytest.raises` to check for `AttributeError` in cases where `hypotez` isn't found in the path. This is crucial for robustness.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `test_cwd` improves readability.

3. **Edge Cases:**  Tests now address edge cases such as when `hypotez` isn't present in the path. and when the current working directory is invalid.


4. **Directory Creation and Removal:** Added `os.makedirs` and `shutil.rmtree` to create and remove a temporary directory for testing purposes. This prevents issues if a similar directory exists or if the test creates files, etc.


5. **Path Validation:** Added a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during directory creation, allowing the test to skip if the directory cannot be created. This is crucial for robustness because the test environment may not have the permission to create directories.


6. **Reset `sys.path`:**  The tests now explicitly clear `sys.path` before each test run to ensure each test starts with a clean slate, avoiding potential side effects from previous test runs.

7. **`os.chdir()`**:  Now correctly uses `os.chdir()` to set the working directory for testing, which is necessary for proper path resolution.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` in your terminal.


This improved test suite is more comprehensive and robust, covering potential issues and edge cases not addressed in the previous example. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`).  Crucially, this version now also cleans up the temporary directory that was created.  This is essential in a CI/CD environment where multiple tests may be run.
