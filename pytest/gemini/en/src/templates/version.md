**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `settings.json`:**  Crucially, the tests now mock the `settings.json` file using `open('..settings.json', 'w')` and `json.dump()`.  This allows you to control the content of the file for different test cases (valid, invalid, non-existent) without affecting the real file. The critical improvement is removing the real file after each test.
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The `test_settings_not_found` and `test_settings_invalid_json` tests specifically address potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions, respectively. This is vital for robustness.
3. **Default Value Check:** The `test_default_values_if_settings_is_empty` test validates that the code correctly uses default values when `settings` is either empty or not loaded.
4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now more explicitly check for the expected values and types (`isinstance` not needed here because we expect strings).
5. **File Cleanup:** The code now removes the temporary `settings.json` file after each test to prevent issues with subsequent tests or the real file.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`.

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage, accurately checking for various scenarios, and is much more robust due to the file mocking and cleanup.  Remember to replace `../settings.json` with the correct relative path if your file structure is different.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Applications:**

- **File Cleanup:** The tests now clean up the temporary `settings.json` file.
- **Error Handling:**  The tests include essential error handling for `FileNotFoundError`, and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- **Realistic Data:**  The example data for the tests is more realistic and comprehensive.
- **Isolation:** The tests are now completely isolated from each other, ensuring that one test case does not affect another.
