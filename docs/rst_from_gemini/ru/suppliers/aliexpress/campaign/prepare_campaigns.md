"""
This module prepares AliExpress campaigns by processing categories,
handling campaign data, and generating promotional materials.

### Examples:
To run the script for a specific campaign with specific categories:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py summer_sale -c electronics -c apparel -l EN -cu USD

To run the script for a specific campaign processing all categories:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py summer_sale -l EN -cu USD

To process all campaigns in a directory, with all categories, for all locales:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py --all -l EN -cu USD

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to `process_campaign_category` and potentially other functions.  This is crucial.  If a function within `AliCampaignEditor` raises an exception, the entire script won't crash.  Log the error for debugging.  Return `None` to indicate failure. This also allows the caller to gracefully handle the failure.

* **Explicit `None` return:**  The `process_campaign_category` function now returns `None` to signal an error. The calling function needs to check for `None` before using the result.

* **Clearer `main_process` function:** Instead of using a single `categories` argument, accept a `Union[List[str], str]` to handle both a single category string and a list. This makes the function more flexible.

* **Improved Docstrings:** Docstrings are now more specific and detailed, particularly on return types and error handling for `process_campaign_category`. The examples in the docstrings are more helpful in understanding usage scenarios.


**How to Use the Improved Code:**

```python
# Example usage, handling potential errors:

result = process_campaign_category("summer_sale", "electronics", "EN", "USD")

if result is not None:
  print(f"Product titles for electronics: {result}")
else:
  print("An error occurred during category processing.")


# Example using main_process:
main_process("summer_sale", ["electronics", "apparel"], "EN", "USD")  # List of categories
main_process("summer_sale", "electronics", "EN", "USD")  # Single category
```

By implementing error handling, the script will be more robust and provide useful error messages when something goes wrong, helping in debugging.  Always handle potential `None` values from functions. Remember to adjust error handling and logging in other parts of the code as needed.
