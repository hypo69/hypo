**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for invalid input (mixed valid/invalid URLs), empty input, and the edge case where `retrieve_product_details` returns `None` or raises an exception.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test the `urllib.error.URLError` that might be raised.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **Mock External Dependencies:** The tests now mock `ensure_https`, `save_png_from_url`, `save_video_from_url`, and `j_dumps`, making them independent of external resources and more efficient.
* **Handling Empty Lists:** Added tests for cases where `retrieve_product_details` might return an empty list.
* **HTTP Error Handling:** Included a test case to verify that `process_affiliate_products` handles potential `urllib.error.URLError` exceptions during the retrieval of product details. This is crucial for production-level code.


This revised solution addresses the crucial aspects of writing robust `pytest` tests, including handling various input scenarios, edge cases, and exception conditions. Remember to adapt the `src` path and file names to your actual project structure. Remember to replace placeholder exception types with the actual ones raised by your code. Also, replace the mocked functions with your functions' actual names if you have modified your code.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Usage:**

* **Mocking `save_png_from_url` and `save_video_from_url`:**  These are potentially crucial functions that handle I/O.  You may want to adjust your test approach if they involve file system interactions.  Mocking them is often sufficient.
* **Realistic Data:** Using realistic, but not overly complex, URLs and data would make the tests more complete.
* **Error Handling:** Always test how your code handles errors.


By adding these more complete test cases, you'll improve the reliability and robustness of your code. Remember to adapt the test cases to your specific needs and the actual functions and error handling you have implemented in your project.
