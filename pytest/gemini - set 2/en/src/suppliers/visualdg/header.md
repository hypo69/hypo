**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `Path`:** The `mock_set_project_root` fixture effectively mocks the `Path` object for more reliable testing. It now uses `tmp_path` from pytest to create the temporary directory structure for testing.


* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability and understanding.


* **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Using `tmp_path` from `pytest` creates temporary directories for each test, ensuring isolation and preventing interference between tests.


* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now include cases for valid input, missing marker files, marker files in parent directories, and most importantly, exception handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. This demonstrates a thorough test suite.

* **Correct `assert` Statements:** Asserts are updated to compare against the expected paths.  

* **`@patch`:** Now uses `@patch` for mocking, which is a more robust approach.

* **Complete Setup:** Creates `settings.json`, `README.MD`, and marker files within `tmp_path`.


This improved solution addresses the previous issues and creates a more robust set of tests that cover the different scenarios and exception handling in `set_project_root`. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/visualdg/test_header.py
```

(Assuming you've created a `test_header.py` file containing the code.)  This will execute the tests within the appropriate folder structure.   You need to replace `hypotez/src/suppliers/visualdg/test_header.py` if the file is located elsewhere.  Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual package name if it differs.
