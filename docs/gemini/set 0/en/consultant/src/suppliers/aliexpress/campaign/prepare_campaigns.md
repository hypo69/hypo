```markdown
**Changes Made**

*   Added missing imports (`argparse`, `copy`, `Path`, `List`, `Optional`).
*   Replaced `get_directory_names` with the updated version.
*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to all functions and methods.
*   Implemented error handling using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error` for better error reporting.
*   Improved variable names and comments for clarity and consistency.
*   Added `return []` in `process_campaign_category` to handle potential errors.
*   Corrected `locales_list` construction and filtering to efficiently handle locales.
