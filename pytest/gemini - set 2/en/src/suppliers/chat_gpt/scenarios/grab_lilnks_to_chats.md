**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `j_loads_ns` functions, making the tests independent of the external dependencies and preventing potential failures from issues beyond the `get_links` function itself.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Added tests for various potential exceptions, including `AttributeError` (from an invalid locator), `json.JSONDecodeError` (from bad JSON), and exception from `Driver` calls.  This is crucial for robust testing.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Included a test for the case where no links are found, demonstrating a realistic edge case.  Also added test for invalid URL to cover scenario when URL causes an error.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Fixtures:**  Uses `pytest.fixture` to manage the mock data, improving organization and readability.
* **Correct Exception Types:** Uses `pytest.raises` to assert the expected exception type, which is essential for precise error checking.
* **Import fixes**: Fixes incorrect imports for the necessary modules.
* **Pathlib**: Uses pathlib for more robust file path handling (if needed in the future).


This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous response and provides a much more thorough set of tests covering various scenarios, including error handling, edge cases, and invalid inputs. Remember to replace placeholder exceptions with the actual exception types expected by your code.  Run `pytest` in your terminal to execute these tests. Remember to replace placeholder exceptions with the actual exception types expected by your code. Also make sure that the `hypotez` directory and necessary subdirectories exist in your project structure.
