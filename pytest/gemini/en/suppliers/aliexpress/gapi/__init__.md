```python
import pytest
from packaging.version import Version
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.gapi import MODE, __version__, __doc__, __details__

# No specific functions or classes are present in the provided code,
# so we test the constants.  This is a minimal example and more
# comprehensive tests would be necessary for a production system.


def test_mode_is_development():
    """Checks if MODE is set to 'development'."""
    assert MODE == 'development'


def test_version_is_a_version_object():
    """Checks if __version__ is a Version object."""
    assert isinstance(__version__, Version)


def test_docstring_is_a_string():
    """Checks if __doc__ is a string."""
    assert isinstance(__doc__, str)


def test_details_is_a_string_or_none():
    """Checks if __details__ is a string or None."""
    assert isinstance(__details__, (str, type(None)))


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Targeted Tests:** The provided code only defines constants.  The test cases now focus on verifying the type and value of those constants.

2. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are descriptive, clearly stating the purpose of each test.

3. **Appropriate Assertions:** Assertions are used to check for expected values and types.  We use `isinstance` to confirm the expected types for the constants.  We also check for `None` in the case that `__details__` could be null.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_gapi.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_gapi.py`


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing (If more code is provided):**

* **More Complex Logic:** If the code had functions or classes with more complex logic, you would need more sophisticated tests, including:
    *   **Valid input:**  Testing with various expected inputs.
    *   **Invalid input:** Testing with incorrect data types, out-of-range values, or unexpected inputs to check for robustness.
    *   **Edge cases:** Testing boundary conditions (e.g., minimum/maximum values, empty lists/arrays, etc.).
    *   **Error handling:** Using `pytest.raises` to test that expected exceptions are raised when appropriate.

* **Fixtures:** If the functions rely on external resources (e.g., files, databases, network calls), use pytest fixtures to manage those resources so that your tests run in isolation.
* **Code Coverage:** Use `pytest --cov` to run your tests with coverage analysis to identify code sections that aren't being tested.


This improved example provides a more realistic and robust approach to testing. Remember to tailor the tests to the specific logic and behavior of the functions and classes in the code you want to test. If more code is available, we can provide even more targeted and comprehensive test cases.
