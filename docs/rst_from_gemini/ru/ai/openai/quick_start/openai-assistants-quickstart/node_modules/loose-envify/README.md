# loose-envify

Fast (and loose) selective `process.env` replacer using [js-tokens](https://github.com/lydell/js-tokens) instead of an AST. Works just like [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) but much faster.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/loose-envify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/loose-envify)

## Usage

loose-envify has the exact same interface as `envify`, including the CLI.  Simply use it as you would any other transform in your build process (e.g., Webpack, Browserify, etc.).

## Key Differences and Limitations

This module is significantly faster than `envify` but sacrifices some functionality for speed.  Crucially, it's *not* a full parser and has some limitations:

* **Broken Syntax:** Will not handle cases with broken or malformed JavaScript syntax in the input.
* **Embedded Expressions:** Won't replace variables inside template literals or other embedded expressions.  For example, `console.log(\`the current env is \${process.env.NODE_ENV}\`);` will not work.
* **Odd Spacing/Comments:** Skips over variables with unusual spacing or comments around them, like `console.log(process./*won't*/env./*work*/NODE_ENV);`

## Benchmark

This module is demonstrably faster than `envify`:

```
envify:
  ... (multiple runs showing longer times) ...

loose-envify:
  ... (multiple runs showing consistently much shorter times) ...
```

The benchmarks show a considerable performance improvement, especially in larger files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install loose-envify
```

## Example Usage (with Browserify)

```javascript
// your-file.js
var env = require('loose-envify')();
var value = env(process.env.MY_VARIABLE);
console.log(value);

// package.json:
{
    "browserify": {
        "transform": ["loose-envify"]
    },
  ...
}
```

This assumes you have `MY_VARIABLE` set in your environment.

**Important Note**:  Always prefer `loose-envify` over `envify` for new projects due to its speed advantage and for projects where you don't need the full parser functionality of `envify` (for example, static strings).
