**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block in `request_handler` to catch potential exceptions during data extraction.  This is crucial to prevent the crawl from failing if a single page causes an issue.  The error is logged using `context.log.error` and the crawl continues.  More sophisticated error handling (skipping problematic URLs, retrying, etc.) could be added.
* **Data Extraction Limit:** Added `content = (await context.page.content())[:100]` to limit the amount of content extracted to prevent excessive memory usage and improve efficiency.
* **Clearer Documentation:** Improved docstrings for better understanding of each function and class.
* **Example Usage Outside the Class:** The example usage is now outside the `CrawleePython` class, which is a better practice and more flexible.
* **Correct Logging:** Changed `logger.info(f'Extracted data: {data.items}')` to `logger.info(f'Extracted data: {data}')` to print the dictionary correctly.
* **Error Handling in `main`:** Added a `try...except` block to `main` to catch any exceptions during the crawl.


**How to Run:**

1.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `crawlee`, `playwright`, etc.  You'll need to install `crawlee` using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install crawlee playwright
    ```

2.  Make sure your `src` and `gs` modules are properly set up and accessible in your project.

3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python hypotez/src/webdriver/crawlee_python/crawlee_python.py
    ```

This revised code is more robust, handles potential errors, limits data extraction, and provides better documentation, making it much more suitable for real-world web crawling applications. Remember to adapt the error handling and logging to your specific requirements. Remember to install `playwright` and any other necessary packages.
