**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Mocking `gs`:** The solution now mocks the `gs` module. This is crucial for unit testing.  It isolates the `get_project_root` function from external dependencies.  We prevent errors and avoid unnecessary file interactions.

2.  **Dummy File Creation and Removal:**  The test cases now create temporary dummy files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `settings.json`, and `README.MD`) for testing specific scenarios, and *crucially*, clean them up after each test. This prevents interference between tests.

3.  **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, cases with marker files in different locations, and the handling of non-existent files and directories.


4.  **Error Handling:** The tests now check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. It's essential to ensure your code is robust against these exceptions.

5.  **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of the test immediately apparent.

6.  **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):**  While `pytest.raises` is useful, these tests don't need it for the file existence checks since we mock the file I/O, making the test more self-contained.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_advertisement_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_advertisement_header.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution is much more robust, covers a wider range of scenarios, and is more effective at testing the core functionality of the `get_project_root` and related functions. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`, `pathlib`, and `json`).


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
