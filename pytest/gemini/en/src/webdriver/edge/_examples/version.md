**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Variable Tests:** The tests now thoroughly cover the different variables (`__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `MODE`), verifying their types and expected values.
* **Edge Case/Invalid Input Testing:** A test (`test_version_not_integer`) is included to demonstrate how to test for unexpected input types.  Another important example (`test_nonexistent_attribute`) verifies that attempting to access a nonexistent attribute raises the expected `AttributeError`. A further `test_version_details_length` example verifies the length of the `__details__` string is not zero.
* **Clear Docstrings:** Each test function has a docstring explaining its purpose and the input/expected output.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions (Example):** The code now includes an example of how to use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling, if there were methods that might raise exceptions.  
* **Mode Test:** The `test_mode_value` test now verifies the value of the `MODE` variable, which is a crucial part of the module's behavior.
* **Robustness:** The `test_nonexistent_attribute` is a crucial test for robustness, as real-world code often has varying attributes or methods.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_version.py`.

This revised solution is more comprehensive and robust, covering various aspects of the input code, including type checking, value validation, and potential exception handling. Remember to adapt and add more test cases as necessary based on the actual functions and methods in your `version.py` file. Remember to replace placeholders with actual values if those values are known. Remember to adapt the test cases to the actual methods in your file.
