```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no test functions can be created.

# Example of a test file that would be appropriate for a JavaScript
# file (e.g., a file that interacts with the HTML elements)

# (Assuming a JavaScript file named 'popup.js')

# Dummy imports for pytest to compile, replace with actual import if needed.
import js2py

# Example test function (requires a js2py runtime setup)

# def test_html_element_exists():
#     """Verify a specific HTML element exists."""
#     # Load the JavaScript code.
#     code = open('popup.js').read()  # Replace 'popup.js' with the actual file.
#     js_env = js2py.eval_js(code)  # Ensure js2py is setup and working

#     # Call a function that interacts with HTML elements.
#     # Replace with the function from your js2py code
#     element_exists = js_env.checkElementExistence()

#     # Assert the element exists (or not)
#     assert element_exists is True  # Modify assertion as needed.



# NOTE:  To test this HTML file effectively, you need to:
# 1.  Provide the associated JavaScript code (`popup.js` or similar).
# 2.  Explain the JavaScript functions you want to test. 
# 3.  If the JavaScript code uses an external library (e.g., jQuery),
#     you might need to set up the proper environment within the pytest 
#     test function using js2py.
# 4. Provide the expected behavior for each test case.

# Example of a testing function that could run the tests
# if you have tests for js functions.
# def test_js_function(js_environment):  # js_environment setup using js2py
#     result = js_environment.myJsFunction(argument1, argument2)
#     assert result == expected_result
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) contains no Python code.  Therefore, no Python test functions can be written to test it directly.  To write effective tests, you need the corresponding JavaScript code (`popup.js`) that interacts with the HTML elements.  You'll then need to use a JavaScript testing library (like js2py) to execute the JavaScript code within the testing framework.

The example above provides a placeholder for such a structure. To generate meaningful tests, you must provide the JavaScript code (`popup.js`) and describe the JavaScript functions, methods, or interactions that you want the test cases to cover.  The example `test_html_element_exists` is a placeholder and would need to be populated with the specifics of the JavaScript function you are testing and the assertions you need to make.  The test will need to call into the JavaScript functions and then assert on the results.
