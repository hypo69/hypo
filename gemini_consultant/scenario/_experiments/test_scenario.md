**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Corrected Path:** The original path calculation was flawed.  This version uses `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.join` to construct the correct path to the project root, making it robust across different operating systems and file structures.  Crucially, it starts from the directory of the current file (`__file__`).

2. **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block. This is essential.  Without it, if `scenario.run_scenarios()` raises an exception (e.g., a `TypeError`, `ValueError`, or other issues), the program will crash.  The `except` block catches any exception and prints an informative error message, helping with debugging.  This is a *very* important improvement for real-world code.

3. **Import Consistency:** Ensured imports are done *after* the path modification.


4. **PEP 8 Style Compliance:** Minor formatting changes to align with Python's recommended style guide (PEP 8).


**Why the previous path was incorrect:**

The original attempt to find the project root relied on `os.getcwd()`. This is problematic:

* **Current Working Directory:** `os.getcwd()` gives the directory you're currently *in* when running the script.  This might be the `_experiments` directory rather than the project's root.  That means the path to `hypotez` is incorrect.

* **Inflexibility:** The `r'hypotez'` portion assumes a specific directory structure. What if you rename a directory or move the repository?


**How to Run:**

1.  **Ensure `hypotez` and `src` directories contain the necessary modules (especially `scenario.py`, `suppliers.py`, and `utils.py`).** The imports in your code depend on these files being present.

2.  **Ensure that the `venv` is activated.**

3.  **Save the corrected code.**

4.  **Run the script:** `python test_scenario.py`


This revised solution makes the code more reliable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.  Importantly, it fixes the crucial path issue, allowing the script to find the necessary modules. Remember to adapt the `venv` path in the `#!` line if your virtual environment is in a different location. Always prefer using `import` to use `sys.path.append`.
