When the program is started via main(), the following sequence of execution occurs:
@code
s = Supplier('aliexpress')

s.run()

s.run('file1')

scenario_files = ['file1', ...]
s.run(scenario_files)

scenario1 = {'key': 'value'}
s.run(scenario1)


list_of_scenarios = [scenario1, ...]
s.run(list_of_scenarios)

# <algorithm>

The code defines a module for scenario execution.  The `__init__.py` file likely imports and provides an interface to functions from the `executor` submodule within the `scenario` package.  It doesn't define any class structures directly.  The algorithm depends on the functions exported by the `executor` module and the `Supplier` class (presumably defined elsewhere). The code illustrates how a `Supplier` object can be used to execute different scenarios.  The specific logic for processing scenarios is not shown here, but is expected to exist in the `executor` module.

* **Example:**  If `run_scenario_files` is called with a `Supplier` object `s` and a list of scenario file names, it likely iterates through each file, loads its contents (presumably JSON), and then calls `run_scenario` function for each scenario in the file using the `Supplier` object.

    end

    F --> J;
```

The diagram depicts a `Supplier` class that contains methods (`run`, `run_scenario_files`, `run_scenarios`) calling functions (`run_scenario`, `run_scenario_file`, from a submodule `executor`).  The execution logic is broken down into stages: loading scenario files, extracting scenarios from them, and processing each scenario.


# <explanation>

* **Imports:** The code imports functions from the `.executor` submodule, likely within the `scenario` package.  These functions (`run_scenario`, `run_scenarios`, etc.) handle the actual execution of the scenarios, meaning  `src.scenario.executor` module provides the crucial logic for performing operations on scenarios.
* **Classes (Implicit):** The code references a `Supplier` class (assumed to be defined in a different file likely in `src.supplier`).  This class represents a supplier and provides methods for handling scenario execution, likely with attributes for the supplier details.  The `__init__.py` file in the scenario folder imports and provides an interface to those functions.
* **Functions:**
    * `run_scenario_files`: Takes a `Supplier` object and a file list.  It iterates through files, loads and runs scenarios within each file using the `run_scenario` functions from `executor`.
    * `run_scenarios`: Takes a `Supplier` object and a list/dictionary of scenarios. It iterates through scenarios and calls `run_scenario` for each one.
    * Other functions in the import statements, `run_scenario`, `run_scenario_file`, `execute_PrestaShop_insert`,  `execute_PrestaShop_insert_async` are part of the `executor` module.  They likely perform the actual operations for executing scenarios, such as handling data input, calls to other services (PrestaShop), etc.
* **Variables:** The `MODE` variable defines the execution mode, possibly used for configuration.  The `scenario_files` and `list_of_scenarios` variables are examples of how to organize scenarios for execution.   These are likely part of a larger program's data structure.

* **Possible Improvements:**
    * **Error Handling:**  The code doesn't show any error handling.  Adding `try...except` blocks around file loading and scenario execution would make the code more robust.
    * **Documentation:**  While docstrings are present, they could be more comprehensive, especially for the functions in the `executor` module, clarifying their parameters, return values, and error conditions.
    * **Dependency management:** It is unclear how other parts of the system are utilized. The `Supplier` class (and possibly other modules) need to be properly documented and analyzed for dependency and relation to the code provided.

**Relationship to other parts:** The `Supplier` class, handling the scenario execution logic, will almost certainly be dependent on other modules within the `src` package. Those might handle database interactions, PrestaShop API calls, file processing, etc.   The file structure and design patterns in `src` will be vital in building out the complete relationship.
