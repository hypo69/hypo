# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/etzmaleh/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for extracting product data from the `etzmaleh.co.il` website.  It inherits from the `Graber` base class and provides customized logic for handling specific fields of the product page.  The class includes functions for fetching various product details, including potentially custom handling for special fields or interactions with the website's structure.  It utilizes a decorator (`@close_pop_up`) for handling pop-up windows.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class handles the extraction of product data from the `etzmaleh.co.il` website, inheriting from the `Graber` base class.


**Methods**

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` class.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The webdriver instance used for interacting with the website.


#### `grab_page`

**Description**:  Asynchronously extracts product details from a given webpage.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The webdriver instance to use for interaction with the web page.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: A data structure containing the extracted product information.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: Raised if there's an error during locator execution.


## Functions

### `close_pop_up`

**Description**: Creates a decorator for handling pop-up windows.  This function is currently commented out and not used in the example code.

**Parameters**:
- `value` (Any, optional): An optional additional value for the decorator. Defaults to `None`.

**Returns**:
- `Callable`: A decorator function to wrap other functions.


**Note**: The included `close_pop_up` function is a decorator, not a class method. It's intended for use within other methods of the `Graber` class. The example code provides a commented-out placeholder that you'd need to implement to utilize the decorator in the current context.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`:  Raises this exception if there's an error executing locators in the `async` block, which would be caught within the function.
