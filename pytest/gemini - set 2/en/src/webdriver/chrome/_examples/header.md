```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:** The previous test didn't handle the case where the path to `hypotez` wasn't part of the current working directory. This significantly improves test robustness and accuracy.  The `mock_getcwd` function simulates different scenarios.

2. **Capturing `sys.path`:**  The `test_append_to_syspath` now correctly captures the initial state of `sys.path`, checks if the path is appended, and restores the original state, ensuring the test doesn't affect subsequent tests.

3. **Error Handling:** The tests now handle the scenario where `hypotez` is not found in the path. This is an important edge case.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more descriptive, making the tests easier to understand.

5. **Test `dir_root` calculation:** A test is added to check the correct calculation of `dir_root`. This is crucial because the path calculation is the core functionality.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


**Important Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **Importing Modules:** The tests import `header` directly. If `header` imports other modules, you should test those as well.  For instance, `from src import gs`. Make sure the `src` directory is properly set up in your project.


* **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (e.g., `pytest`) installed using `pip install pytest`.

* **Complex Logic:** As the actual code becomes more complex (e.g., involving external calls), test the logic in those functions as well.


This revised example provides a much more comprehensive and reliable test suite for the code. Remember to replace the placeholder paths (`/tmp/hypotez`, `/tmp/not-hypotez`) with paths relevant to your project's structure.
