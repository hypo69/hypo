Okay, I understand. This directory contains markdown files that are used as instructions and system prompts for an AI model, and they don't contain any Python code that requires testing. Therefore, I cannot write `pytest` tests for this code, because it is not executable Python code.

The files `system_instruction_mexiron.md` and `command_instruction_mexiron.md` seem to contain natural language instructions, and not Python code that I could test with `pytest`.

**Response:**

Since the provided input is not Python code, I cannot generate `pytest` test cases. The provided input describes files that store instructions and prompts for an AI model, and these are not testable as Python functions or classes using pytest.

I will generate an informative message stating that tests cannot be written for the input.

```python
import pytest

def test_no_python_code():
    """
    This test case is a placeholder to clearly indicate that no tests were generated.
    It verifies that a warning/message is raised instead of attempting to test markdown files.
    """
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError, match="Cannot write tests. The provided input does not contain Python code."):
        assert False, "Cannot write tests. The provided input does not contain Python code."
```
