```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Crucially, the tests now mock the internal functions (`id_product`, `description_short`, etc.) within `grab_page`. This isolates the `grab_page` function from external dependencies, preventing unexpected behavior due to network calls or database interactions.

2. **`close_popup` Test Cases:**  Two tests are added, one for success and one for failure, covering the exception-handling logic within the decorator.  This is a good approach to thoroughness.

3. **`grab_page` Test:** The `test_grab_page_valid_input` test now mocks the inner functions and `fetch_all_data`, providing a robust way to test the main logic without relying on external calls (which would be very difficult to manage in a unit test).

4. **`ProductFields` Mock:** I've added a dummy `ProductFields` instance so that the test verifies that the `grab_page` function returns an object of the expected type.

5. **Asynchronous Handling:** The `asyncio.run` calls are placed where needed in the test functions.  This is the proper way to handle `async` functions.

6. **Error Handling:** pytest.raises is used correctly to check for the expected exception.

7. **Clearer Test Names:** The tests are named descriptively to explain what they're checking.

8. **Fixture for Graber:** The `graber` fixture is more comprehensive now as it includes the initialization of the `l` variable, which was missing.


**To run these tests:**

- Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
- Replace the placeholder imports (`from src import ...`) with the actual import paths from your project.
- Make sure the `src` module exists and contains the necessary modules and classes.
- Modify the mock objects (e.g., `MockDriver`) to accurately represent the behavior of the classes and functions that your tests are meant to cover.  Add more mock tests as necessary.


This significantly improved solution provides better isolation and covers the critical aspects of your code, enabling more effective testing. Remember to add more test cases for other functions and edge cases within the `Graber` class.
