How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block imports the `CodeAssistant` class from the `code_assistant` module within the `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69` directory. It sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports the necessary modules.  It specifies the Python interpreter path for execution via `#!` directives, and imports `CodeAssistant` from a submodule.  This presumable import path implies there is a `code_assistant.py` file containing the `CodeAssistant` class.
2. The code defines a variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value 'dev' to it. This variable likely controls the operational mode (e.g., development or production mode) of the application.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming the required modules are properly installed and the file structure exists

    # Import the necessary modules from hypotez.
    # Note: This part assumes a relative import structure is in place
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant import CodeAssistant

    # Now, the variable MODE is initialized, this might be used elsewhere to condition
    # the behavior of CodeAssistant instances.
    MODE = 'dev'

    # Create an instance of the CodeAssistant class.
    # Example usage, assuming CodeAssistant constructor is defined:
    assistant = CodeAssistant()
    #  The rest of the code will depend on what CodeAssistant does, 
    # this is just an example to demonStarte usage of the import.
    # ... (further code interacting with assistant object)
