```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `example_settings_file` and `example_readme_file` fixtures.  These create temporary test files containing example data, simplifying the test cases. The fixtures are now more robust and maintainable because they handle file creation and cleanup.  This avoids cluttering the tests with file creation code.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more specific (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added tests covering:
   - Valid inputs (both marker files in the same directory and parent directory).
   - Cases where marker files don't exist.
   - Handling of `FileNotFoundError`.
   - Handling of `json.JSONDecodeError` (though the original code doesn't directly catch this).


4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Used `pytest.raises` to test for `FileNotFoundError` in `set_project_root` when files do not exist.

5. **Robustness:** The `example_settings_file` fixture now cleans up the temporary file, preventing issues if the test fails.

6. **Mocking (Important):**  The original code depends on external files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`).  You should *not* directly interact with these files in the tests; instead, you should mock the file contents and the return values from the `Path` objects.

7. **`sys.path` Modification:**  The test now confirms that the root directory is added to `sys.path`, testing the correct behavior in the `set_project_root` function.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`

2. Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/goog/drive/header.py`.

3. Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_header.py`


**Crucially, you need to add these lines at the top of your test file to import the correct modules:**

```python
import pytest
import json
# ... (other imports)
from hypotez.src.goog/drive.header import set_project_root, settings, doc_str
```

This assumes that your `hypotez` package is structured correctly and the `import` statements in `header.py` resolve correctly. If you're still getting errors, you might need to adjust the `from` clauses to match your specific directory structure. This is **essential** for testing the functions correctly.  Remember to replace `hypotez.src` with the actual path if needed.
