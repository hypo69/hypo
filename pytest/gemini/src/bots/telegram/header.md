**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Fixtures:** The `mock_file_system` fixture now properly creates a temporary directory structure to avoid conflicts with the user's project.  It creates the necessary marker files within this temporary directory.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various scenarios:  existence of marker files in different locations (including parent directories), absence of marker files, multiple marker files.
* **Error Handling:** Added a test specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to cover exception handling in the original code.  Crucially, we now correctly use `tmp_path` to create a *temporary* file system for these tests instead of modifying the user's.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions (not needed here):**  We don't actually need `pytest.raises` for the `FileNotFoundError` in this case; the file creation/non-creation is directly tested within the `test_...` functions.
* **`settings_file` Fixture:** Added a fixture to create a properly configured `settings.json` file, making the tests for loading settings more realistic.
* **`settings_data` Fixture:**  Provides easily manageable data for the `settings.json` file.
* **File Existence Checks:** Ensures the necessary temporary files/directories are correctly created and present.
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Use the `tmp_path` fixture from pytest to create temporary directories for tests involving file operations, crucial for avoiding unintended side effects.
* **Docstring improvements**: Improved the docstrings for clarity and added detail to the expected behavior.

This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and addresses the edge cases and potential errors in a more realistic and controlled manner, ensuring that the `set_project_root` function works correctly in various situations. Remember to install `pytest` and `packaging` if you haven't already.  For `json`, it's usually already included in Python.
