How to use the Graber class for extracting product data from cdata.co.il
==================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a `Graber` class, inherited from a `Grbr` class, that gathers product data from the `cdata.co.il` website.  It handles various fields of product pages using dedicated functions.  It's designed for asynchronous operations (using `asyncio`) and leverages a WebDriver for interacting with the website.  The class allows for custom data extraction logic through overridden functions for each field.  Crucially, it supports optional pre-execution actions via a decorator to, for example, close pop-up windows before gathering specific data.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:**  The code imports various Python libraries like `asyncio`, `Path`, `typing`, `dataclass`, `functools`, `pydantic`, and custom modules (`gs`, `graber`, `product_fields`, `driver`, `jjson`, `logger`, `exceptions`). These are needed for asynchronous operations, file paths, type hinting, data structures, decorators, data validation, web driver interaction, JSON handling, logging, and custom exceptions.

2. **Define the `Graber` class:**  This class inherits from the `Grbr` class, providing a standardized structure for data extraction.  It initializes with a WebDriver instance (`driver`) and sets a `supplier_prefix` to 'cdata'.

3. **Define the `grab_page` method:** This method is the central function for collecting product information. It utilizes an asynchronous function, `fetch_all_data`, to sequentially call individual field extraction functions (e.g., `id_product`, `name`, etc.).


4. **Field extraction functions:** The code defines a set of functions (`id_product`, `name`, etc.) to handle each specific product field.  These functions are responsible for interacting with the WebDriver to locate and retrieve the field's value from the webpage.

5. **Asynchronous execution:** The `grab_page` method uses `asyncio` to manage the asynchronous operations performed by each field extraction function within the `fetch_all_data` function.

6. **Data storage:**  The extracted data is stored in the `fields` object of the `Graber` instance, which is assumed to be an object complying with the `ProductFields` structure.

7. **Error handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks in the `close_pop_up` decorator to catch `ExecuteLocatorException` in case of issues while executing the locator.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from src.suppliers.cdata.graber import Graber
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        # Assuming you have a Driver instance called 'driver'
        driver = Driver()  # Replace with your actual driver initialization
        graber = Graber(driver)
        try:
            product_fields = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product="123") # Replace "123" with the actual product ID
            print(product_fields)
        finally:
            await driver.close()  # Ensure the browser closes

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

```

**Explanation of crucial improvements:**

* **Clearer Description:** The description now explicitly mentions the use of asynchronous operations and WebDriver, which was implicit in the original code.
* **Detailed Execution Steps:** The steps now provide more context, describing the purpose of importing various modules, handling exceptions, and the process of data collection.
* **Comprehensive Usage Example:** The example now includes necessary imports and illuStartes how to initialize the `Graber` instance, use the `grab_page` method, and close the browser, providing a practical way to apply the code.
* **Emphasis on Asynchronous Nature:**  The documentation underscores that the code is asynchronous, which is vital for web scraping.
* **Error Handling:** The documentation highlights the use of error handling (`try...except`) to manage potential issues during execution, enhancing robustness.


This enhanced documentation makes the code much more accessible and usable for others.  Remember to adapt the `driver` instantiation and product ID in the usage example to match your specific setup. Remember to replace placeholders like `"123"` with actual values. Also, ensure the `ProductFields` object exists and is correctly populated within the `Graber` class.
