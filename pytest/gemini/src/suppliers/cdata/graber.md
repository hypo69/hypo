```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `Driver`:**  Critically, the `MockDriver` class now mocks the `execute_locator` method. This is essential because the original code interacts with a WebDriver, which we cannot directly test in a unit test environment.  This prevents dependency on external resources (like a browser) and makes tests reliable.

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Added `test_graber_with_error_handling` to demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions, and how `mock_logger` is now used for more robust testing.

3. **Fixtures for `driver` and `graber`:**  These fixtures properly set up `MockDriver` and `Graber` instances, making the tests more organized and reusable.

4. **`@patch` for Mocking `logger`:**  Uses `@patch` to mock the `logger` (from `hypotez.src.logger`) during the tests. This prevents the logger from actually writing to a file or console, keeping the testing environment clean.

5. **Clearer Test Names and Comments:**  Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init_with_locator`). Comments explain the purpose of each test.

6. **Edge Case (Missing Locator):** `test_graber_no_locator_decorator` now checks the case where no locator is set.

7. **Error Handling:** `test_graber_with_error_handling` demonstrates proper error handling (with `try-except`).

8. **Comprehensive testing:** The tests now provide a more comprehensive coverage based on the given code.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Further Considerations:**

- **Data-Driven Tests:** If the `Graber` class has multiple methods that operate on data, consider data-driven tests for more efficient test coverage.  This could involve creating more specific fixtures for different input scenarios.
- **Decorator Tests:** If the `close_pop_up` decorator is used extensively, more targeted tests (e.g., `test_decorator_example` in the example) would be needed.  These tests would need to test the decorator's behavior with mocked WebDriver interactions.


Remember to replace placeholders like `"test_locator"` with appropriate locator values based on how `Graber` actually works.
