**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for loading JSON data, addressing the requirement to use this specific function.
- Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions during file loading, improving error handling.
- Improved error messages to be more informative.
- Added docstrings for `load_settings` and `load_readme` functions using RST format, providing clear descriptions of the functions' purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors.
- Replaced `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` with `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` for better readability.
- Corrected variable names to follow Python conventions (e.g., `project_root` instead of `__root__`).
- Removed unnecessary comments and reformatted the code for better readability.
- Replaced potentially problematic `sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))` with similar logic using `project_root`.


This improved code is more robust, readable, and follows the specified requirements better. Remember to ensure the `src.utils.jjson` module exists and contains the `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` functions as required. Also, it's recommended to add proper testing.
