**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling in `handle_message`:** The most significant improvement is the addition of a `try...except` block in the `handle_message` function.  This crucial change catches potential exceptions (e.g., issues saving to the log file, problems with the Gemini API) and provides a user-friendly error message instead of crashing the bot.  Logging the error with `logger.error` is also very important for debugging. This is vital for robustness.

* **Empty Response Handling:** The code now checks if the `answer` from the model is empty. If it is, a fallback message is sent to the user.  This prevents the bot from sending nothing in response to a valid user message.

* **Robust Logging:** The use of `logger.error` is standard best practice.  It allows you to catch these errors and investigate them later.

* **Append to Log:** Changed `save_text_file` to append to the file (`append=True`), preventing overwriting existing log data.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Types:**  The `except Exception as e` is a broad catch-all. In production, you should be more specific about the exceptions you expect to handle to prevent masking more serious issues that should cause the bot to stop running.

* **Logging Configuration:** Make sure you have your logger correctly configured to write to a file (or other destination) for proper error tracking and monitoring.

* **`history_file` Handling:** Ensure that the `history_file` mechanism for Gemini is well understood and functioning correctly.

* **Rate Limiting:** Check that your Gemini API usage does not exceed any rate limits.  API errors could be another important type of exception to handle.


This revised code is substantially more robust and user-friendly because it gracefully handles potential problems that can occur when communicating with the Gemini AI model. Remember to configure your logging properly for effective debugging. Remember to install `telegram` and `google-generative-ai`.
