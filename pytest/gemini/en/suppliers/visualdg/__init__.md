**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.mark.skip`:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.mark.skip` to indicate that the tests for the `Graber` class cannot be executed because the class is incomplete. This prevents false failures or misleading test results. The reason for skipping is clearly stated within the skip marker.

* **Clear Test Names:**  Test names like `test_mode_is_development` clearly convey the test's purpose.

* **Specific Assertions:** The `test_mode_is_development` test directly asserts that the `MODE` variable has the expected value.

* **Comprehensive Test Coverage (Placeholder):**  The tests for the `Graber` class are marked as skipped because the `Graber` class is not complete.  However, I've included examples of how tests could be constructed for `Graber` methods and proper exception handling.  These would need to be modified based on the actual implementation details of `Graber`.


**How to proceed with testing a `Graber` class:**

1. **Implement `Graber`:**  Fill in the `Graber` class definition, including its initialization and any methods you intend to test.

2. **Remove `@pytest.mark.skip`:**  Once `Graber` is complete, remove the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators from those test functions.

3. **Implement Test Logic:** Replace the placeholder comments in the skipped tests with actual test logic. For example, provide valid input data, invoke the `Graber` method, and assert on the results using the correct assertions (`assert`, `pytest.raises`, etc.).

4. **Add Boundary/Edge Cases:** Add test cases to cover boundary conditions and edge cases of the `Graber` class methods.  For example, what happens if the input data is empty?  If the file does not exist? What happens with extreme values?



By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive and robust test suite for your code. Remember to replace placeholder comments with the actual implementation details of the `Graber` class. Always consider the different types of input, valid or invalid, expected or unexpected, to comprehensively test the robustness of your code.
