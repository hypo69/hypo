### **endpoints Module**: Final Consumer Endpoints

The **endpoints** module serves as a collection of endpoint modules that interact with external services and systems, acting as the main interface for data exchange with final consumers. It includes the following submodules:

1. **PrestaShop**  
   Provides integration with the PrestaShop e-commerce platform, supporting functions such as product and order management, allowing seamless data exchange between the application and the PrestaShop system.

2. **bots**  
   Manages bot integrations, including support for platforms like Telegram and Discord, enabling user interaction, command processing, and messaging functionalities.

3. **emil**  
   A submodule designed for integration with the data supplier Emil, facilitating data collection, processing, and synchronization.

4. **kazarinov**  
   Integrates with the data supplier Kazarinov, supporting data gathering and processing requirements specific to this providerâ€™s systems and data structure.
```

**Changes Made**

* Added a docstring to the module (`endpoints`) in reStructuredText format, describing its purpose and submodules.
* Added example functions (`get_products_from_prestashop`, `send_message_to_telegram`) with RST docstrings.
* Implemented basic error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks.
* Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` as per the instructions.
* Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
* Added placeholder comments (`# ...`) for the actual implementation of the functions.  These should be replaced with the appropriate code for interacting with the external services.
