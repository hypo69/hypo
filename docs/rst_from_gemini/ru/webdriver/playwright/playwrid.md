""" Playwrid Crawler

This Python code defines a custom Playwright crawler, `Playwrid`,
inheriting from the `PlaywrightCrawler` class from the `crawlee` library.
It extends PlaywrightCrawler with the ability to load custom browser settings
and launch options from a JSON file.

**Purpose:** Provides a more flexible and configurable way to control
Playwright browser instances within a larger web crawling framework.

**Example Usage:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    browser = Playwrid(settings_name="custom_settings")  # Use custom settings
    browser.start("https://www.example.com") 
```

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks in `_load_settings` to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid JSON) gracefully, preventing the script from crashing and providing informative warnings. Defaults to a blank `SimpleNamespace` if loading fails.
* **Clearer Docstrings:** Improved docstrings for better readability and understanding.
* **Correct `run()` method:**  Corrected the call to `super().run()` in the `start()` method.  This is crucial for the PlaywrightCrawler functionality.
* **`current_url` Property:**  The `current_url` property is now correctly implemented to return `None` if the context is not available and the url is not yet set, avoiding potential errors.
* **Explicit `SimpleNamespace`:** Uses `SimpleNamespace` to properly handle the settings, which is better than assuming the settings dict would already exist.


**Explanation of Changes and Key Concepts:**

*   **Error Handling:** The crucial improvement is the error handling in `_load_settings`. It now gracefully handles JSON parsing errors and the absence of the settings file, preventing the entire program from crashing due to unexpected errors.


This revised code is significantly more robust and user-friendly, making it suitable for integration into a larger project. Remember to adjust `gs.path.src` to match your project structure. Remember to include the necessary `crawlee` and `json` packages in your project. Remember to replace `__init__.py` and `src.utils.py` with the actual file names in your project structure. Always check the `crawlee` package documentation for any updates to the `PlaywrightCrawler` class.
