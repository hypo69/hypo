The `docs` folder contains compiled documentation, as well as recommendations and documentation created by artificial intelligence models. The following materials are gathered here:

## Compiled Sphinx Documentation

This section contains the main documentation generated using the Sphinx tool. It includes descriptions of the project structure, API, architecture, and other important aspects. The documentation can be compiled into various formats, such as HTML, PDF, and others.

### How to Compile the Documentation

1. Ensure that Python and Sphinx are installed.
2. In the command line, navigate to the `docs` folder.
3. Run the following command to build the documentation:

   ```bash
   sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
   ```

4. The resulting documentation will be available in the `_build/html` folder.

## AI-Generated Recommendations and Documentation

This section contains recommendations created using artificial intelligence models to improve code quality, development, and documentation. The models may provide suggestions in the following areas:

- Function and class descriptions
- Coding standards
- Testing recommendations
- Performance optimization
- Best practices
