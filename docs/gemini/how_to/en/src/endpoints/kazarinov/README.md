How to use the Kazarinov Telegram Bot

This document describes the Kazarinov Telegram bot, its components, and how to use it.

**Components:**

* **`KazarinovTelegramBot`:**  This is the main bot class responsible for handling incoming Telegram messages and interacting with other components.  The provided links (`https://one-tab.co.il`, etc.) likely point to websites providing data used by the bot.

* **`BotHandler`:** This class parses incoming links from the Telegram messages received by the `KazarinovTelegramBot`.  Crucially, it appears to be the middleware between the Telegram bot and the logic for generating pricelists.

**Data Flow:**

1. A user sends a link (e.g., from the provided list) to the `KazarinovTelegramBot`.

2. The `KazarinovTelegramBot` passes this link to the `BotHandler`.

3. The `BotHandler` parses the link.  The crucial step is *what* the `BotHandler` extracts from the link.  This is *not* described.

4. The parsed data is then passed to the `scenario_pricelist` component.

5. `scenario_pricelist` likely performs calculations and/or data transformations based on the parsed link.

6. `pricelist_generator` uses the processed data to generate a pricelist.

**Key Questions and Missing Information:**

* **`BotHandler` parsing logic:** What does the `BotHandler` extract from the links?  What format is the parsed data in?  Is there a specific format required for the links (e.g., a particular parameter in the URL)?
* **`scenario_pricelist` functionality:** What does this component do?  What are the specific calculations or transformations performed? What input does it expect?
* **`pricelist_generator` output:** What is the output format of the generated pricelist?  Is it a simple text list, a formatted table, or something else?
* **Error handling:** How does the bot handle invalid links or errors during processing?
* **Authentication and authorization:** Is there any authentication required to access the linked websites?

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```
# Assuming a user sends the link https://one-tab.co.il/products/widget
# 1. KazarinovTelegramBot receives the link
# 2. KazarinovTelegramBot passes it to BotHandler
# 3. BotHandler extracts product ID 'widget' from the link.
# 4. BotHandler passes 'widget' to scenario_pricelist.
# 5. scenario_pricelist retrieves price data for 'widget'.
# 6. pricelist_generator formats and sends the pricelist to the Telegram user.
```


**Next Steps:**

To create a complete usage guide, you need to provide more details about the internal workings of the `BotHandler`, `scenario_pricelist`, and `pricelist_generator` classes.  Without this information, the usage guide will remain incomplete.  Be sure to document these components, including input and output formats and specific functionalities.
