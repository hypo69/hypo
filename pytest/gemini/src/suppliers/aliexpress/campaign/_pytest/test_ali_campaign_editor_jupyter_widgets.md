**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Uses `@pytest.fixture` for mocking `Path.open`, `Path.mkdir`, and `logger`, making tests more robust and avoiding external dependencies.  Critically, the `monkeypatch` approach is used within the fixture for cleaner mocking.  This avoids potential conflicts from multiple tests using the same mock objects.

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now more explicitly describe the condition being tested (e.g., `test_save_text_file_invalid_filename`).

* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added tests for invalid filenames (non-strings), empty directories, and `FileNotFoundError` during file reading.

* **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to assert that correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs, which is crucial for robust testing.

* **Docstrings:** Enhanced docstrings for clarity and to show example usage.

* **No Unnecessary Output:** Removed unnecessary `print` statements from the tests.

* **Explicit Warning Check:** Added an assertion to check if the logger is not emitting warnings unnecessarily in `test_save_text_file`.


This revised solution provides a much more thorough and robust set of tests for the provided code. It adheres to best practices for `pytest` testing, and is far more likely to catch issues in the production code. Remember to replace `"src.utils.file.file"` with the actual module path if it's different in your project.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as `test_ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets.py` in the same directory as your `src` directory.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets.py`
