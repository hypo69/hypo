**Note**:  The provided Python code includes a significant amount of comments that are not necessarily useful for proper documentation.  The comments related to platform and synopsis (`.. module` etc) are markdown-style comments.  Python comments (`"""docstrings"""`) are used to document individual functions and classes as requested, but many comments in the example code are not following the requested format.  Further, the code imports a great many modules and classes from various (unspecified) `src` sub-modules. A more detailed explanation and understanding of the `src` modules' functionality would greatly enhance the documentation.
