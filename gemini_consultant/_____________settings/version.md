**Explanation of the change and why it's important:**

The original placeholder `_____________settings` was replaced with `config_settings`.  This is a more standard and descriptive name for a Python module containing configuration settings.  Using a clear and meaningful name improves code readability and maintainability.   It's best practice to have descriptive names to reflect the purpose of a module.
