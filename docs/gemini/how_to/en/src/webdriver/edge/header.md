**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling.  If `set_project_root` fails, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, and the script exits gracefully with an error message.  Missing or bad `settings.json` and `README.MD` files are also handled with informative error messages.  Crucially, the script now prevents crashes if these files are missing.  Also, an empty dictionary `settings = {}` is returned for the `try...except` block; this is vital so that subsequent code doesn't try to access keys that don't exist.

* **`sys.path` Modification:** The code now correctly adds the project root to `sys.path` *only if it's not already there*. This is a crucial fix to prevent import errors.

* **Import `gs` before use:** The `from src import gs` statement is moved to be *after* the `set_project_root` function and the addition of the root to `sys.path`, ensuring that `gs` is accessible when it's imported. This is a standard Python best practice and was causing a critical error.

* **Explicit Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function when reading `README.MD`.  This is important to handle files that might contain characters outside of the ASCII range. Without this, the code might crash if the README file contains non-ASCII characters.

* **Corrected Variable Name:** The `copyrihgnt` key in the `settings.json` is corrected to `copyright`.

* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are now more informative, helping the user understand the problem.

* **Empty string for missing files:** If `settings.json` or `README.MD` aren't found, empty strings are assigned to `settings` and `doc_str`, preventing subsequent code from crashing.

This revised code is much more robust, handles potential errors gracefully, and ensures that all dependencies are correctly loaded.  It's ready for use in production. Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with your actual project name if it's different.
