```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  A `chrome_driver` fixture is introduced to encapsulate driver creation. This is crucial for keeping tests isolated and avoiding creating multiple drivers.
* **Valid/Invalid URLs:** Tests now explicitly check for both valid and invalid URLs when calling `get_url`.
* **Edge Cases:** The `test_scroll_invalid_direction` demonStartes handling an invalid direction for the scroll.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive to easily identify failures.
* **Simulate Page Load:** The `test_find_element_by_css_selector` and `test_current_url` examples now simulate loading a page (`chrome_driver.get_url(...)`) before interacting with elements to be more realistic.
* **Type checking (important):**  Checks are added for the expected return types (e.g., ensuring the page language is a string) in several tests, making tests more robust and informative.
* **_save_cookies_localy():**  Tests for this method now simulate success as the actual implementation details are unknown.
* **Missing imports:** Added `from src.webdriver import Driver, Chrome`  (crucial).
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Used `pytest.raises` for testing exception handling in the case of invalid `scroll` direction.

**How to run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as `test_driver.py` (or a suitable name).
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_driver.py`


**Crucial Considerations:**

*   **Actual Implementation:**  The provided code example for `Driver` and `Chrome` classes is heavily simplified.  Real-world testing needs to take into account dependencies on external systems (e.g., the web browser). 
*   **Browser Interaction:** Tests will need to simulate interactions with a web browser (and often require a WebDriver instance to be initiated, which might be a fixture).   This example uses mock data for simplicity but would need to be replaced with actual interaction in a complete test.
*   **Error Handling:** The examples included are limited.  You need to add comprehensive error handling to account for various situations that may arise during web interaction.
*   **Data-Driven Tests:**  Consider using parameterized tests (another `pytest` feature) to create more efficient tests, especially for cases with multiple valid inputs.


By incorporating these improvements, the tests become more comprehensive and robust, covering a wider range of scenarios and providing better feedback on potential issues in the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes. Remember to replace the placeholder fixture and any necessary import statements with the actual implementations from your project.
