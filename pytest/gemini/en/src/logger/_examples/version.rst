**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`test_name_main_on_execution`:** This test is commented out in the previous response.  You *cannot* test `__name__` inside a pytest test.  The `__name__` variable depends on the execution context (running a file directly vs. importing it).  This test is omitted because you can't verify it within a test function.   
* **`test_docstring`:** A more robust test is provided to ensure `__doc__` is a string, which is important for type safety.
* **Clearer test names:**  Descriptive names make the tests easier to understand and maintain.
* **`pytest.raises` for exception testing:** Demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` for testing missing attributes.
* **Handling Missing Attributes:**  A `test_missing_attribute` case demonstrates how to check for and handle cases where an attribute might not exist.
* **Testing for `MODE` (If needed):**  A test for the `MODE` constant has been included, if you need to validate it's value.
* **Focus on the core elements:** The tests now focus on the essential data attributes (version, author, docstring).  
* **Correctness and completeness:** The tests now correctly verify the aspects specified in the provided Python code's docstrings.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.

This improved test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the module's attributes and handles potential exceptions (like missing attributes) effectively. Remember to adjust the tests if the structure or functionality of the module changes. Remember to place `test_version.py` in the same directory as `version.py` (or adjust the import path accordingly).
