**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block to catch `KeyboardInterrupt` (for graceful exit) and general `Exception` to handle any unforeseen errors.  Critically, it now includes a `traceback.print_exc()` to get the full error context.  This is *essential* for debugging.
* **Logging Configuration:** Moved logging configuration to the top of the file.  This is best practice and ensures that the logger is properly initialized. Added more descriptive log messages and appropriate log levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`).
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Changed `filenames` to `filtered_filenames` to avoid confusion.
* **Robust File Handling:** Introduced `get_file_paths` for constructing file paths, which now takes a base directory argument.  This makes the code more flexible and prevents hard-coded paths.  **Crucially, it's now more robust and handles potential errors (e.g. if the base_dir doesn't exist).**
* **`base_dir` Variable:** Explicitly defines `base_dir`. This is a much better way to handle the directory than embedding it in the filename list, since you can easily change where the json files are located.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** Encapsulates the `main` function, a standard Python practice.
* **Driver Cleanup:** Includes a `finally` block to ensure that the `d` (webdriver) object is properly closed (`d.quit()`) regardless of whether the program exits normally or encounters an error. This is essential for preventing resource leaks.
* **Type Hinting:** Using `typing.List` improves code readability and maintainability, and helps static analyzers catch potential errors.


**Before Running:**

1. **Replace `"C:/Users/user/Documents/repos/hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/data"`:**  Change this placeholder `base_dir` to the correct path to the directory containing your JSON files.
2. **Ensure `src.logger` exists:**  Verify that the `src.logger` module (or equivalent) is set up correctly and available in your project.
3. **Install necessary packages:** Make sure you have the necessary packages for your script installed (e.g., `selenium`, `json`, `requests`, and anything in the `src` folder if not part of the standard library). Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you have a `requirements.txt` file specifying dependencies.


**How to Debug:**

If you run into an error, look at the `ERROR` messages in the console output. The stack trace will contain very valuable information about where the error occurred.  Inspect the data in the log files as well. This improved version is much more helpful for debugging!
