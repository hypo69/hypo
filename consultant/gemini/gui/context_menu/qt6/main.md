"""Module to add or remove context menu items for the desktop and folder background using PyQt6.

This module provides functions to add or remove a custom context menu item called 
'hypo AI assistant' for the background of directories and the desktop in Windows Explorer.
It uses the Windows Registry to achieve this, with paths and logic implemented to target
the right-click menu on empty spaces (not on files or folders).

**Explanation of Changes and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Absolute Path Fix:** The original code was trying to construct paths relative to a potentially incorrect or non-existent `gs.path` object.  This is now fixed using `os.path.dirname(__file__)` and `os.path.join(script_dir, 'main.py')`.

2. **Import `sys`:**  The `sys` module is crucial to get the current directory.


3. **`os.path.join()`:** Using `os.path.join()` is essential for creating file paths that work correctly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). This fixes the potential issue of incorrect paths on other platforms.



**Why the previous solution might have failed:**

- **Incorrect Path:** The original code had a potential problem constructing the `command_path` correctly, potentially leading to the file not being found.  Using `gs.path` object could result in issues if that variable wasn't properly initialized, and it would only work with Python's handling of path calculations (which might not work the same way in different systems or if the script is run in a different context).

- **Lack of Robust Path Handling:** The original code lacked a robust and cross-platform method to obtain the absolute path to the script itself.  This new code addresses this by using `os.path.abspath(__file__)` which always returns an absolute path.

- **Error Handling:** While the original code had error handling, it's still better to explicitly handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions and provide more descriptive error messages.  Using `os.path.exists` improves clarity and gives the user an immediate clue about what's wrong.

With these changes, the code should reliably locate the Python script and add/remove the context menu item correctly, regardless of the current working directory or operating system. Remember to adapt the `header` module imports and any other custom logic if needed.
