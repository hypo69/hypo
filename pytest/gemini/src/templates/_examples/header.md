**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `mock_os_getcwd` and `mock_sys_path` functions to create isolated test environments.  This is crucial for testing the code without affecting the real file system or the global `sys.path`.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Tests now cover the different scenarios of `dir_root` and `sys_path_append` calculation and handling.

3. **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests to check `dir_root` calculation for cases where the project structure might be different or the "hypotez" folder is missing.

4. **`autouse` Fixture:** A `restore_sys_path` fixture is used with `autouse=True` to ensure that the `sys.path` is restored to its original state after each test. This is essential for preventing unintended side effects from test to test.

5. **Module Import Test:** Added a test to verify that the imports from `src` and submodules are working correctly. This test relies on the assumption that `gs`, `Supplier`, etc., are defined in the src directory.

6. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, reflecting the scenario being tested.

7. **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block to the `test_module_imports` function to catch `ModuleNotFoundError` and fail the test if any import fails, providing informative error messages.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code (e.g., as `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.

2.  **Run from the command line:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

**Important Considerations for a Real Application:**

* **More Realistic Imports:**  For a more realistic test case you would need to mock the `Path` objects, or, in general, have modules available to properly test the import functionality.  The current testing does not actually interact with the file system, but it tests the logic of how `dir_root` is calculated and `sys.path` is manipulated in relation to the project.
* **Dependency Injection:** The best practice, instead of modifying `sys.path`, would be to inject the required paths through dependency injection.  This makes the code more testable and maintainable.


This revised solution provides a more robust and complete set of test cases to cover the functionality of the given `header.py` code. Remember that depending on the complexity of your code, you might need more tests and mock functions. Remember to replace `/path/to/project` with the actual path to your project. Remember to replace the file imports and the corresponding paths with the actual path structures of your project.
