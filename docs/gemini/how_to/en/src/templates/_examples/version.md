How to use the `version.py` file

This file, `version.py`, defines variables crucial for versioning and identifying a module or package. It's likely part of a larger project's structure.

**Key Variables and Their Usage:**

* **`__version__`:** This variable stores the version string of the module.  In this example, it's set to `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`.  You'll use this when referencing the version of your module in documentation, external tools, or during updates.

* **`__name__`:** This is a special variable.  It's typically set to the module's name (e.g., `'version'`). When the script is run directly (not imported as a module), `__name__` becomes `'__main__'`.  This is often used for conditional execution within the file (e.g., running tests or specific code blocks only when the file is executed directly).

* **`__doc__`:** This string variable holds the module's documentation string.  The documentation is currently multi-line but could be enhanced with reStructuredText formatting for a more readable format.  It could describe the purpose, usage, and other relevant information about the module.  Avoid just listing parameters; rather, explain *how* the module is used.

* **`__details__`:**  This variable appears to contain additional version-specific details. Its purpose might be to store a description, version history, or other critical information relating to the module's version, such as dependencies.

* **`__annotations__`:** This variable is currently empty.  If present, it would hold type annotations to specify the data types expected for variables and function parameters, which can aid in code understanding and maintainability.

* **`__author__`:**  Stores the author's name. In this example, it's set to `"hypotez"`.  Adding a date or a list of contributors is common.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# In another Python file:
import hypotez.src.templates._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.templates._examples.version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(hypotez.src.templates._examples.version.__name__)  # Output: <module name> (e.g. hypotez.src.templates._examples.version)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This code is executed only when run directly.")
```

**Important Notes:**

* **File Structure:**  The file `version.py` is part of a project's structure. Its function is tied to the package it belongs to and typically used to maintain version consistency throughout the package.

* **Comments and Documentation:** The multi-line strings in the beginning of `version.py` appear to be attempts at documentation but lack consistency and clarity. A well-maintained `__doc__` string is crucial for readability and use cases of the module. Improve these comments for better understanding.
