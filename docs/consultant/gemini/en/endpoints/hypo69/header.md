**Changes Made**

- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for reading JSON files.
- Added error handling with `logger.error` for file loading errors, preventing the script from crashing.
- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Added type hints for function parameters and return types.
- Improved docstrings to conform to RST (reStructuredText) format.
- Renamed variable `__root__` to `project_root` for better readability and consistency.
- Fixed typo in variable name `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Added a try-except block and `logger` error handling to the `settings` loading section.
- Added a try-except block and `logger` error handling to the `README` loading section.
-  Corrected encoding to UTF-8 for reading README.MD.
- Removed unnecessary comments and unused imports.
- Modified comments and docstrings to be RST compliant.
- Renamed variable `settings_file` to `settings_file_path` and `readme_file` to `readme_file_path` for better clarity.
