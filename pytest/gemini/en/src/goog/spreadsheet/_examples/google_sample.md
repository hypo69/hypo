**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock the `build`, `execute` methods and even the `Credentials` object. This is crucial for testing the internal logic of `main` without depending on external services like the Google Sheets API.  This avoids actual API calls and associated network delays.
* **Clearer Test Cases:** The test cases are now structured to explicitly test different data scenarios and expected outputs for each.
* **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used to test different input scenarios with `mock_values` and `expected_output`.
* **Exception Handling:** A test case `test_main_with_http_error` specifically tests the `try...except` block in case of `HttpError`.
* **No Credentials File:** A test `test_main_no_credentials_file` is added to handle the case where `token.json` does not exist.
* **Complete Coverage:** The tests now better cover the various branches of the code (`if not creds`, `if creds and creds.expired`).
* **Output Validation:** The output validation is now more robust by checking the actual print statements.
* **Robust Mock Data:** Now mock the `execute` call.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_google_sample.py`).
3.  Run `pytest test_google_sample.py` from your terminal.

Remember to have a `credentials.json` file in the same directory as your test file if you want to test the credential retrieval part, or you can adjust the code to completely mock the credential-handling portion.  The current approach is much more suitable for avoiding actual API calls.


This improved solution provides significantly more robust and comprehensive tests by isolating the logic, avoiding the reliance on external resources, and testing diverse scenarios. Remember to adapt the path to the `credentials.json` file and any other static data needed in the input code if it is different in your project.
