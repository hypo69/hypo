# hypotez/src/templates/__init__.py

## Overview

This module, `src.templates`, likely serves as an initialization point for template-related functionalities within the `hypotez` project.  It likely defines constants, imports necessary modules, and potentially manages version information.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  This variable likely defines the operational mode of the templates (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Imports

**Description**: The module imports several components.

- `header`:  Potentially imports a module related to template headers or formatting.
- `...`:  Placeholder for other, potentially numerous, imports.
- `packaging.version`:  For managing version information of packages.
- `.version`: Likely imports version-related variables (e.g., `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`).


## Functions

No functions are explicitly defined in this `__init__.py` file.


## Notes

The presence of numerous multiline docstrings without any content within is noteworthy.  It strongly suggests that these docstrings are placeholders or that the documentation was meant to be completed at a later stage. The `...` signifies that further imports or functions may exist, but their structure isn't shown.  Additional documentation would be needed to understand the specific roles and functionalities of those components.
