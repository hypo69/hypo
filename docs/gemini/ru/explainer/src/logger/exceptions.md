.. module: src.logger.exceptions
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: This module defines custom exceptions used in the application.

Program Exceptions
------------------

This module contains several custom exception classes to handle errors related to various application components, including file operations, product fields, KeePass database connections, and PrestaShop WebService errors.

Classes:
--------
- CustomException: The base custom exception class that handles logging.
- FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file is not found.
- ProductFieldException: Raised for errors related to product fields.
- KeePassException: Raised for errors related to KeePass database connections.
- DefaultSettingsException: Raised when there are issues with default settings.
- WebDriverException: Raised for errors related to WebDriver.
- ExecuteLocatorException: Raised for errors related to locator executors.
- PrestaShopException: Raised for generic PrestaShop WebService errors.
- PrestaShopAuthenticationError: Raised for authentication errors with PrestaShop WebServices.

# <algorithm>

Unfortunately, a step-by-step algorithm for the code cannot be created without knowing how these exceptions are used in other parts of the application.  The code defines various exception types for specific error scenarios, but the *algorithm* for how they are used lies elsewhere in the program.  Their use involves:

1. **Exception Creation:** A specific exception type is instantiated with a message and, optionally, an underlying exception.
2. **Exception Handling:** In a calling method (not present in the snippet), these exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. This will likely involve logging, error reporting, retry logic (if applicable), or other actions tailored to the specific error type.

# <explanation>

* **Imports:**
    * `from typing import Optional`: Imports the `Optional` type from the `typing` module, used for specifying optional arguments.
    * `from src.logger import logger`: Imports the `logger` object from the `src.logger` module. This is likely a logging handler (e.g., from `logging` or a custom logging implementation), allowing the code to log errors using the logger instance.
    * `from selenium.common.exceptions import WebDriverException as WDriverException`: Imports the `WebDriverException` class from the `selenium.common.exceptions` module, likely for Selenium-related errors.  The `as WDriverException` creates an alias for clarity.
    * `from pykeepass.exceptions import ...`: Imports specific exception types from the `pykeepass` library. These handle potential errors when interacting with a KeePass database.  This reveals a dependency on the `pykeepass` library.  This is critical to understanding the scope and intent of the code.  (Import multiple exceptions from the same package).


* **Classes:**
    * `CustomException`: The base exception class. It logs the error and any original exception that may have caused it. This class is essential for consistent error handling and logging across the application.  It takes a message and an optional original exception (`e`) to handle the situation where one exception wraps another.
    * `FileNotFoundError`, `ProductFieldException`, `KeePassException`, `DefaultSettingsException`, `WebDriverException`, `ExecuteLocatorException`, `PrestaShopException`, `PrestaShopAuthenticationError`: Specialized exception classes for particular error scenarios. Each inherits from either `CustomException` (for logging) or another exception class where appropriate (e.g., `IOError` for file errors or  exceptions from the `pykeepass` library). This organization improves code maintainability.  They provide specific error information tailored to the application's needs.

* **Functions:** There are no functions *within* the provided code block that handle arguments or return values.  The initialization methods (`__init__`) in each class are the key functions for initializing and handling the exceptions.

* **Variables:** The `MODE` variable is a string indicating the execution mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod'). This is often useful in conditional logging or configuration.

* **Possible Errors/Improvements:**
    * **Missing Context:** The exception messages are crucial.  While the code sets up the basic framework, the *meaningful* messages need to be added in other parts of the code, when exceptions are raised.  The current messages are helpful but may not provide enough context for troubleshooting in a real-world application.


* **Interdependencies:** The code depends on the `logger` from the `src.logger` module, the `pykeepass` library for KeePass interactions, and the `selenium` library for WebDriver interaction.  This indicates that the application has dependencies on several external libraries, which is a standard practice for Python development. This module is designed to be part of a larger application and relies on other components (`logger` in `src`) for functionality.

**Overall:** The code defines a structured way of handling various exceptions related to application components.  Its use requires calling code in other files of the project; this code defines the exceptions and their types but does not directly implement how these exceptions are thrown, caught, or handled by the application.
