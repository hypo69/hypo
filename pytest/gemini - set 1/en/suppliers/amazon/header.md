```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Critically, the code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` and `monkeypatch` to mock file access and the `Path` class for greater control and isolation during testing.  This is crucial for testing functions that rely on external files.  The `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures allow you to create temporary files with specific content, ensuring your tests don't depend on the real file system.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more specific and descriptive, improving readability and understandability.

3. **Parameterization:** The `test_get_project_root_with_incorrect_marker_files` function now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test the function with different sets of marker files, making the test more comprehensive.

4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Added tests for different scenarios, including:
   - The case where the marker files are present in the current directory.
   - The case where marker files are not present in the current directory.
   - Testing with incorrect marker files (to ensure no exceptions are raised).
   - Testing with marker files in a parent directory. 

5. **Fixture for Mock Data:** The `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures now correctly create temporary files and return their paths.

6. **Exception Handling:** The original code had `...` in the `try...except` blocks.  While this is not wrong, it's often better to assert for expected exceptions in tests.  In this case, however, we are making sure that the program does not crash when the expected files do not exist.

**Important Considerations:**

- **`sys.path` modification:**  The original code modifies `sys.path`, which can have unintended side effects in other tests.  If this modification is essential, consider using a `tmp_path` fixture (which is already used) to control the effects in your tests.
- **Real files:** Consider testing with actual files and directories (outside of the test cases) if this is part of the project's normal workflow or deployment process.

Remember to adapt the `Path` handling to match the actual file structure of your project. Also, the comments on edge cases or specific tests should be made specific to this context.  If the `__root__` path does need to be added to `sys.path`, test that addition.

This significantly improved solution will allow for more robust and reliable testing of the `get_project_root` function.  It's also a good starting point for testing other parts of the file where exception handling is present.
