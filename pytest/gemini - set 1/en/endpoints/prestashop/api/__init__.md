```python
import pytest

# Tests for the PrestaShop module (assuming api.py exists and contains the PrestaShop class)
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import PrestaShop


def test_prestashop_mode():
    """
    Tests the MODE constant to ensure it's correctly set.
    """
    assert PrestaShop.MODE == 'development'


# If there are any functions or methods in the PrestaShop class, 
#  add more test cases below, providing dummy implementations in api.py
# Example:
# from .api import PrestaShop


# def test_function_in_PrestaShop_class():
#     # Assuming a function 'get_product' exists in PrestaShop
#     ps = PrestaShop()
#     # Replace with actual valid input.  
#     product_id = 123
#     # Expected output for this example.
#     expected_output = {"name": "Product 123", "price": 19.99}
#     assert ps.get_product(product_id) == expected_output

# This example is a placeholder.  You need to replace with the actual
# method in PrestaShop to create real tests.


# Example edge case (replace with actual edge case if applicable)
# def test_prestashop_invalid_input():
#     ps = PrestaShop()
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         ps.get_product(-1)  # Example invalid input
#     assert "Invalid product ID" in str(excinfo.value)  # Assert a specific error message
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **Missing `api.py`:** The provided code only imports `PrestaShop`, but there's no definition of the class or functions within `api.py`.  This example assumes a class exists.  You **absolutely need to provide the actual content of `api.py`** to write meaningful tests.

2. **Example Test Structure:** The example tests for a `MODE` constant and illuStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.  Importantly, the `test_prestashop_invalid_input` example demonStartes a *proper way* to handle invalid input.

3. **Dummy Data:** The comment in the placeholder example shows how you'd need example data for your tests.  Replace the placeholder data and the `get_product` call with the actual logic from your `api.py` file.

4. **Exception Handling:** The `test_prestashop_invalid_input` example demonStartes how to test error conditions. You **must** include tests for valid and *invalid* inputs to demonStarte a complete test suite.   **Asserting the specific error message** (as shown) is important.


**To create complete tests, you need to:**

- **Provide the content of `api.py`**.
- **Identify the functions and methods** within `PrestaShop` class (e.g., `get_product`, `create_order`, etc.).
- **Design appropriate test cases** that cover valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and exceptional situations for each function.
- **Provide sample data or fixtures** as needed.


**Example `api.py` (IlluStartive):**

```python
# hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api.py
class PrestaShop:
    MODE = 'development'

    def get_product(self, product_id):
        if product_id < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid product ID")
        # Replace with your actual product retrieval logic
        if product_id == 123:
            return {"name": "Product 123", "price": 19.99}
        return None
```


Once you provide `api.py`, I can generate more specific and accurate test cases for you.  **Crucially**, the `api.py` content determines the tests required.  Don't forget error conditions!
