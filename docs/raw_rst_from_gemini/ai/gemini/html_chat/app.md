""" module: src.ai.gemini.html_chat
This module implements a simple web-based chat application using FastAPI and the Kazarinov AI model.
It allows users to submit questions, and receives responses from the Kazarinov model.
The application displays the conversation in an HTML template.  
It dynamically loads questions from a specified directory on Google Drive, providing a way to cycle through prompts.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` when accessing the question files, and any exceptions raised by the `k.ask()` function.  This prevents the application from crashing if the question directory is missing or if there's an issue with the Kazarinov model.  Crucially, it provides informative error messages to the user.
* **Empty Questions List:** Checks if `questions_list` is empty before trying to choose a random question.  This prevents an error if no questions are loaded.
* **Robust Question Loading:**  The code now correctly loads all files within the specified directory on Google Drive.
* **Readability:** Improved variable names and added docstrings to explain the module's purpose and functionality, improving code maintainability.
* **Random Question Selection:** Now selects a *random* question *from a randomly chosen file*, addressing the previous issue of only selecting the first line.

**How to run (assuming you have `uvicorn` and your dependencies installed):**

1.  **Ensure `gs` is defined:**  Make sure you have the correct setup for your initialization module `__init__.py` to properly define and access `gs`.
2.  **Correct file paths:** Double-check that the file paths (`gs.path.google_drive / 'kazarinov' / 'prompts' / 'q'`) are correct for your Google Drive setup and the location of your prompt files.
3.  **Run with uvicorn:** Open a terminal in the directory containing this file and run:
```bash
uvicorn hypotez.src.ai.gemini.html_chat.app:app --reload
```

This will start the development server.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the chat application. Remember to use `--reload` to automatically reload changes.



This improved version is much more robust and user-friendly, handling potential errors and providing informative messages. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`fastapi`, `pydantic`, and others) if you haven't already.
