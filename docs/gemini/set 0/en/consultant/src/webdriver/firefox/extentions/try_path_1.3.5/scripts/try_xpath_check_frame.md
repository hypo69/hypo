};
```

# Changes Made

*   Added a function `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` to encapsulate the content loading check.
*   Documented the function with RST-style docstrings.
*   Added a placeholder implementation for the content loading check.
*   Added a return value indicating that the page content is not loaded by default. This placeholder needs to be replaced with the actual implementation.
