How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code snippet imports the `ReportGenerator` class from a module named `pricelist_generator`.  It also sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'.  This likely signifies a development mode for the application.  The important aspect is the `ReportGenerator` class, which presumably handles the generation of price lists (reports). This file likely acts as an entry point for using this functionality.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The Python code imports the `ReportGenerator` class from a module named `pricelist_generator` within the specified path (`hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/pricelist_generator`).
2. The `MODE` variable is assigned the string value 'dev'. This assignment might be used for conditional logic or configuration purposes elsewhere in the application.

Usage example
-------------------------
```python
# Assuming the ReportGenerator class is defined in a module located in
# hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/pricelist_generator/pricelist_generator.py

from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.pricelist_generator import ReportGenerator

# Example usage (replace with your actual data and configuration).
# Create a ReportGenerator instance.  Details on parameters for ReportGenerator
# are not available in the given code; consult the definition of ReportGenerator
# in the referenced module.
report_generator = ReportGenerator(data=your_data, configuration=your_config)

# Generate the report.  You need to define what you want the method to return
# (e.g., a generated report string) and how that data will be used.
generated_report = report_generator.generate_report()  # Call the appropriate method


# Example of how to use the generated report.
print("Generated Report:\n", generated_report)

```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`your_data` and `your_config`:**  Replace these placeholders with the actual data and configuration required to initialize the `ReportGenerator` object. The exact structure and content of these variables depend entirely on the implementation of `ReportGenerator` in the `pricelist_generator` module.
* **`generate_report()`:**  The code snippet does not include the implementation of the `generate_report()` method.  This would define the actual logic for generating the price list.  Locate the `pricelist_generator` module to see the complete definition of this method.
* **Error Handling:**  Production-level code should include error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully manage potential issues during report generation.

This updated example provides a more complete and realistic usage scenario, emphasizing the need to consult the `ReportGenerator` definition for a complete understanding of how to use it. Remember to replace placeholders with actual data.
