# Example of how to use these variables in documentation generation or other places:
# print(f"Project: {__project_name__}, Version: {__version__}")

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the code won't crash. Instead, it prints a warning to the console, letting the user know and preventing a critical error. This is essential for robustness.

* **Variable Naming:**  Corrected `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__` â€” a common typo.

* **Docstring Placeholder:** Added placeholders for `__doc__` and `__details__` to demonstrate where documentation strings would go.  It's good practice to define these, even if empty, to improve the overall structure.

* **Explicit Type Hinting:** Using `__version__: str = ...` is good practice for type hinting. It makes the code more readable and understandable for other developers.

* **Concise `if settings`**:  Keeping the conditional logic succinct.

* **Example Usage:**  Added a comment showing how the variables could be used in a larger program or document generation process.

**How to Use This Code:**

1.  **`settings.json`:** Create a file named `settings.json` in the same directory as `version.py`.  It should contain JSON data like this:

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/support"
}
```

2.  **Import and Use:** In other parts of your project, import `version.py` and access the variables:

```python
import sys
from logger import version

print(f"Project: {version.__project_name__}, Version: {version.__version__}")
```

This improved version is more robust, readable, and demonstrates better practices for Python code. Remember to replace the placeholder values in `settings.json` with your actual project information. This file (version.py) can now be more reliably integrated into the rest of your project's modules. Remember to adjust the paths (e.g., venv paths) to match your project's structure.
