```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `Driver` and `FacebookPromoter` classes using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`.  This is crucial for testing internal logic without depending on actual Facebook interactions.  Crucially, `mock_driver` is now used to instantiate the `FacebookPromoter` within the tests.

2. **`@patch` for `time.sleep`:** Correctly patches the `time.sleep` function, simulating the delay and avoiding actual sleep during tests.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test the `KeyboardInterrupt` and `ValueError` exceptions, ensuring that the exception is caught and handled appropriately.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover more scenarios:
   - Valid input (successful campaign run).
   - `KeyboardInterrupt` (exception handling).
   - Invalid input (e.g., `filenames = None`) where a `TypeError` is expected.
   - Exception during `run_campaigns` (a more realistic and complete test).


5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are added to verify that `run_campaigns` was called with the expected parameters and that `time.sleep` is called.  Also, assertions are now made to confirm that the logger was called with the correct messages.


6. **Fixture Improvements:** The `mock_logger` is a critical fixture that allows mocking the logging to make sure the exception is logged in the cases that it should be.


This revised solution is significantly more robust and realistic in testing the `start_posting.py` code's behavior in various conditions, including error handling. Remember to install the necessary libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest
