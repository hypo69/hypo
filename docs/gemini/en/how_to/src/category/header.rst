How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It starts from the current file's directory and searches upwards in the file system until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, it adds the root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`).  The code then loads settings from `settings.json` and the project's `README.MD` file into variables, and finally sets variables containing project name, version, documentation, and author information from the settings.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, `Version` from `packaging`.


2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names as input. It initializes `__root__` to the directory containing the current file.


3. **Iterate through parent directories:** The code iterates through the parent directories of the current file's directory.


4. **Check for marker files:** For each parent directory, it checks if any of the marker files exist within that directory.


5. **Set `__root__`:** If a marker file is found, `__root__` is updated to the parent directory, and the loop breaks.


6. **Add root to `sys.path`:** If `__root__` is not already in `sys.path`, it's added to the beginning of the list.


7. **Return `__root__`:** The function returns the determined root directory path.


8. **Call `set_project_root`:** The code calls the function to find the project's root directory and assigns the result to the variable `__root__`.


9. **Load settings:** The code attempts to load settings from `settings.json` within the project's root directory. If the file is not found or is not valid JSON, it handles the exception gracefully.


10. **Load documentation:** The code attempts to load documentation from `README.MD` within the project's root directory. If the file is not found or an error occurs, it handles the exception gracefully.


11. **Set project information variables:** The code populates variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, and others with data from the loaded settings, falling back to default values if the data is unavailable.


12. **Return variables:** These variables containing project information are made available for use in other parts of the project.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have a project structure with pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, etc.)
    from hypotez.src.category.header import set_project_root
    
    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root directory: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
