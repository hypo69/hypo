**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Robust Project Root Determination:**
   - `pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]` is much more reliable.  It finds the path to the current file, then goes up two parent directories to find the project root, resolving any symbolic links in the process.  This is crucial, especially if the file is in a subdirectory that might have different paths in different environments.
   - The use of `pathlib` makes the code more Pythonic and easier to read, while also handling potential path issues more effectively.

2. **Explicit `str()` Conversion:**
   - `sys.path.append(str(project_root))`  Explicitly converts the `Path` object to a string before appending it to `sys.path`. This avoids potential issues.

3. **Removed Redundant `[: ... +7]`:** The original code snippet used a rather complex slicing expression to extract the project root. The `pathlib` approach is far cleaner and more efficient.


4. **Corrected Return Value:**
   - The `return Supplier(**params)` statement was missing a closing parenthesis.  I've added it. This is a common and subtle error.

5. **Improved Import Style:**  While imports from `__init__.py` are more robust and better for maintainability than imports from `hypotez` (unless you intend to use the functionality from that folder directly, without requiring other elements from the same folder), a more modern import style (importing from a specific folder) is usually preferred:


**Why the previous code was problematic:**


* **Potential for errors:**  The original code's method of calculating the project root was brittle. If the file structure changed, it could lead to incorrect paths.


* **Inflexibility:** The slicing method was highly dependent on the project structure and wasn't generalizable.

* **Import Issues (Implicit):**  Importing from `hypotez` this way might not work if the folder `hypotez` did not contain all necessary classes. Importing from `src` is better for projects which follow a standard structure.


**How to use:**

Make sure that you have a `__init__.py` file in the `hypotez` folder and that `gs`, `Supplier`, `Product` and related modules are correctly initialized there if they are imported.  (e.g., they may be inside `src`.)

```python
# Example Usage (assuming you have a 'src' folder with a `__init__.py`):

from hypotez.src.scenario._experiments import header
my_supplier = header.start_supplier('MyPrefix')
```
