```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  The original code silently ignored errors if `settings.json` was missing or corrupted.  The improved code prints an error message, which is vital for debugging.  More sophisticated error handling (logging) is also recommended in a production environment.
* **Corrected Typo:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"`.
* **Variable Type Hinting:** Maintaining type hints is a good practice.  The type hints for `settings` and the various constants are already present.  These are part of the code style and good practices.
* **Readability:** Minor improvements to the spacing and variable naming convention to enhance the code's readability.
* **Docstrings (Potential):** While the docstrings are present, they are empty.  If this module is intended for use by others, adding informative docstrings would be beneficial.

**Why these changes matter:**

* **Robustness:** The improved code handles potential errors, making it more robust in various situations.
* **Debugging:** The error messages help in identifying problems quickly when `settings.json` is unavailable or has invalid data.
* **Maintainability:** Clear error handling and consistent coding style make the code easier to maintain and modify in the future.
* **Collaboration:** Following coding conventions and best practices makes the code easier to understand and collaborate on.



**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "MyProject",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2023 Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Logging:** In a real-world application, it's much better to use the Python logging module instead of just printing to the console.  This allows you to control log levels, log files, and rotate log files.  Add logging to handle the exception:
```python
import logging

# ... (other code)

logging.basicConfig(filename='myapp.log', level=logging.ERROR)

try:
  # ... (rest of your code)
except Exception as e:
  logging.exception("Error loading settings.")
```

* **Error Handling Strategies:** How errors are handled depends on the context.  If a missing `settings.json` is not a fatal error, you might just use a default value. If it's essential to have settings, you might need to terminate the program or display a more user-friendly error message.
