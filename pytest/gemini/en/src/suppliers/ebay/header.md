```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Temporary Directory Fixture (Conceptual):**  The tests now create temporary directories. A proper fixture would be even better for managing these directories and ensuring they're cleaned up after each test. This is crucial for isolating tests.

2. **Mocking `sys.path`:** The `sys.path` is crucial for `set_project_root` to work correctly. The `patch` statement correctly mocks `sys.path` in the test context.

3. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now explicitly state what's expected.

4. **Test Cases for Different Scenarios:** The test cases now cover various scenarios, including cases where the marker files are not present, are in parent directories, and handling the case where `sys.path` is not modified.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Test cases should now properly handle cases where marker files are not present, the files are present in a parent directory, and the starting directory doesn't include project root structure.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fixtures:** Create a dedicated fixture (e.g., `test_data`) for managing temporary directories in a more controlled way.
* **Settings and README:** To thoroughly test the remaining code (loading settings and README), you'll need to mock the file reading operations and construct mock data structures for `settings`.  Use `patch` to mock file opening and `json.load`.
* **Error Handling:** The original code includes error handling (try-except blocks) for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  Your tests should ensure that these error handlers are triggered and that the appropriate defaults are set when these files are missing or corrupted.

Example of mocking for settings (add to `test_header.py`):

```python
import json

@pytest.fixture
def mock_settings_data():
  return {"project_name": "MyProject", "version": "1.0.0"}

def test_settings_loading_with_fixture(mock_settings_data):
    with patch('builtins.open', side_effect=[mock_settings_data]):  #Mock open
        __root__ = Path(".")
        __root__ = set_project_root()
        # assert
```

This more comprehensive approach will lead to more robust tests that cover the full functionality of your code. Remember to adapt the fixtures and mocks to the specifics of your code and the data structures involved. Remember to use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.
