```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The tests now cover the creation and basic behavior of each exception type.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.
* **Exception Handling with `pytest.raises`:** The `test_invalid_argument_exception_raising` and `test_product_id_not_found_exception_raising` demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions.  Critically, these are *demonstration* tests.  **You need to add tests that *actually call* the functions where these exceptions might be raised, not just raise them in isolation.**
* **Structure:** The test structure now follows best practices for `pytest` test organization.
* **Missing Context:**  The crucial missing piece is testing *where* these exceptions are raised.  The provided code defines the exceptions, but you need test functions that call methods or functions where those exceptions are triggered.   This would typically involve some testing framework interaction code like mocking an API or having a test function containing an `if` clause that raises the exception under a given scenario.


**Example of a test needing actual interaction:**

```python
# Assuming you have a function like this (replace with your actual function)
def get_product_by_id(product_id):
    if product_id == "invalid":
        raise ProductIdNotFoundException("Product ID not found")
    elif product_id == "error":
        raise ApiRequestException("API request failed")
    return {"id": product_id, "name": "Product"}


def test_get_product_by_id_product_not_found():
    with pytest.raises(ProductIdNotFoundException) as excinfo:
        get_product_by_id("invalid")
    assert str(excinfo.value) == "Product ID not found"

def test_get_product_by_id_api_error():
    with pytest.raises(ApiRequestException) as excinfo:
        get_product_by_id("error")
    assert str(excinfo.value) == "API request failed"


# ... more tests for valid input and different error scenarios
```

Remember to replace the placeholder `get_product_by_id` function with your actual function and add more tests based on the specific requirements of your application logic.  Crucially, you need to include tests for the *handling* of these exceptions in the calling code, rather than just creating and verifying the exceptions themselves.
