**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:**  Added a module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the file.  The docstrings for `__doc__` and `__details__` are now more informative.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Improved formatting and spacing to comply with PEP 8 style guide.
* **Clarity and Context:**  Made the docstrings more descriptive and relevant to the file's purpose.  This is crucial for documentation.

**How to Use the Docstrings:**

You can access the documentation using tools like Sphinx or simply by importing the module and using Python's `help()` function:

```python
import hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.version as version

help(version)
```

This will print the module docstring and docstrings of the variables, making the code's purpose and usage clearer.


This revised code provides better structure and documentation, making it easier for other developers (and yourself in the future) to understand the purpose and functionality of the `version.py` module. Remember that well-documented code is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.
