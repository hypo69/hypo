## Overview

This module defines the root path of the project.  All imports are built relative to this path.  It aims to provide a consistent way to locate project resources, such as configuration files and documentation.  The root path is determined by searching up the directory tree from the current file, looking for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, the path to the root directory is stored in the `__root__` variable and added to the Python path for easier import of modules.  The module also attempts to load settings from a `settings.json` file located in the project root and project documentation from `README.MD`.  It then provides access to the loaded settings, project name, version, documentation, author, copyright and coffee support link using constants.


## Functions

### `get_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project.

**Parameters**:
- `marker_files` (tuple): A tuple of filenames or directory names used to identify the project root. Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Returns**:
- `Path`: The path to the project root directory.  Returns the current directory if no marker files are found.

**Raises**:
- None


### `get_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project.

**Parameters**:
- `marker_files` (tuple, optional): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root. Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Returns**:
- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.


## Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**: A `Path` object representing the root directory of the project.  This is determined by the `get_project_root()` function.


### `settings`

**Description**: A Python dictionary containing project settings. Loaded from `src/settings.json` if the file exists and can be parsed as JSON.  Otherwise, `settings` is `None`.


### `doc_str`

**Description**: A string containing the content of the project's `README.MD` file, if it exists. Otherwise, `doc_str` is `None`.


### `__project_name__`

**Description**: A string representing the project name. Derived from the `project_name` key in the `settings` dictionary. Defaults to 'hypotez'.


### `__version__`

**Description**: A string representing the project version. Derived from the `version` key in the `settings` dictionary. Defaults to ''.


### `__doc__`

**Description**: A string representing the project documentation. Derived from the `doc_str` variable. Defaults to ''.


### `__details__`

**Description**: A string representing project details.


### `__author__`

**Description**: A string representing the project author. Derived from the `author` key in the `settings` dictionary. Defaults to ''.


### `__copyright__`

**Description**: A string representing the project copyright. Derived from the `copyright` key in the `settings` dictionary. Defaults to ''.


### `__cofee__`

**Description**: A string representing the coffee support link for the project. Derived from the `cofee` key in the `settings` dictionary. Defaults to a standard link.
