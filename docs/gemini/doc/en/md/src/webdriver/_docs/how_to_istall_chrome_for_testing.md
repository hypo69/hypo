# How to Install Chrome for Testing

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to install Google Chrome on a system for use with automated testing frameworks.  This is a prerequisite for using the `webdriver` module.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Chrome Browser:** Navigate to the official Google Chrome website ([https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer:** Execute the downloaded installer. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

3. **Verify Installation:** Once the installation is complete, open the Google Chrome browser.  If it opens successfully, the installation was successful.

## Additional Considerations

* **Chrome Version:** Ensure the Chrome version used matches the specific webdriver version or testing framework requirements. Mismatched versions can lead to compatibility issues.
* **System Requirements:**  Check the minimum system requirements for the desired Chrome version.
