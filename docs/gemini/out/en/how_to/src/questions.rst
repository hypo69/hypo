How to Understand Module-Named Configuration Files
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block discusses the rationale behind naming configuration files after the modules they relate to (e.g., `suppliers.json`). It contrasts this naming convention with a simpler approach (e.g., `config.json`) and explains the reasoning behind the chosen approach in the context of AI model interpretation.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Identify the purpose of configuration files:**  Configuration files are used to store settings or parameters required by a module or system.

2. **Understand the naming convention:** The configuration file names (e.g., `suppliers.json`) are tied to the modules (`suppliers` module in this case) these files provide configuration for.

3. **Recognize the potential benefit of module-specific naming:**  The specific names (e.g., `suppliers.json`) provide better context and association for AI models processing these files, aiding in the understanding and interpretation of the configuration data.

4. **Consider the alternative naming convention:** A simpler approach, using a generic name like `config.json`, may not explicitly link configuration details to the modules requiring them.

5. **Appreciate the AI model perspective:** The given response highlights the advantage of file names that explicitly link configuration details to specific modules (`suppliers` module), potentially enhancing the usability and interpretability by AI models. This contrasts with a generic configuration file name which doesn't make the association as clear.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (This is not actual code, but a conceptual example)
    # Assuming a 'suppliers' module:
    # ... (implementation of suppliers module) ...

    # Example usage of 'suppliers.json' configuration:
    # ... load the configuration from 'suppliers.json' ...
    # ... use the loaded configuration in the 'suppliers' module ...
    # ... (processing or analysis based on config settings) ...
