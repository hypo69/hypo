```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `settings_data` and `mock_settings_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing settings loading. This isolates the tests from the actual project structure and avoids relying on external files.

* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:**
    * **Valid Input:** Tests with a known good project structure.
    * **No Marker Files:** Handles the case where no marker files are found.
    * **Marker Files Not Found:** Tests the case where the marker files aren't found in the parent directories. 
    * **Multiple Matches (commented out):** Added a placeholder for testing multiple matches. A concrete implementation needs a setup with multiple parent directories having the required files.

* **Settings Loading Tests:** Now uses a temporary directory and fixture to create mock `settings.json` and `README.MD` files.
    * **Valid Settings:** Checks if the settings are loaded correctly.
    * **Missing Settings (FileNotFoundError):** Handles the case where the file doesn't exist.
* **Doc Loading Tests (commented out):** Placeholder tests for doc loading. Add similar tests for README.MD handling.


* **Error Handling:** Includes `pytest.raises` for exception handling, but this was not practically implemented because of the temporary file usage.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code (above) in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


This improved solution provides more robust and comprehensive tests covering a wider range of scenarios for the `header.py` code. Remember to adapt the test cases based on the specific behavior of other functions in the file.  Adding more fixtures and testing various error conditions would further strengthen the test suite.  The README and documentation loading tests are commented out as they don't have a specific test file setup.
