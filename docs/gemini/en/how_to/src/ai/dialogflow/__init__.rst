How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block initializes a variable `MODE` with the string value 'dev'.  The code also contains several commented-out sections, likely placeholders for further development or module descriptions. The top of the file includes several metadata comments using the Sphinx reStructuredText syntax for documentation, including module information, platform support, and a synopsis placeholder.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block defines a constant variable named `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'.
2. Multiple multi-line string comments are present, which seem to be intended to document the module's purpose and functionality, possibly using reStructuredText syntax for improved formatting in documentation. The comments are not executable code.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No usage example is provided as the code block primarily defines a single variable.
    # To use this variable, you'd import it into another module and access the 'MODE' variable.
    # Example:
    from hypotez.src.ai.dialogflow import MODE
    print(MODE)
