**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:** The crucial improvement is mocking `os.getcwd`.  Instead of relying on the current directory, we create a mock function that returns a specific path. This isolates the test and avoids unexpected side effects from running the code in a different directory.

2. **Error Handling (`test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`):** Added a test case to handle the scenario where "hypotez" is not found in the path.  This is important for robustness; it uses `pytest.raises` to assert that a `ValueError` is raised, as expected.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately apparent.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover both the successful calculation (with "hypotez") and the error case (without "hypotez"). This provides better coverage of the `header.py` logic.

5. **`test_root_append_to_path`:** This test checks that the calculated root path is correctly appended to `sys.path`.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context:**  The tests now rely on the `os.getcwd()` which assumes that the string `'hypotez'` exists within the current path.  If this isn't a reliable assumption, adjust the tests to use specific paths or make them more flexible in terms of the input paths.



This revised solution addresses the potential issues and provides a much more robust and reliable set of tests for the provided code. Remember to adapt the example paths in the tests to match your actual file structure if necessary. Remember to adapt the example paths if your directory structure is different.
