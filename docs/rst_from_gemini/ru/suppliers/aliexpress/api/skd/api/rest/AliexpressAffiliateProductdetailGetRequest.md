**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the class and its methods.  This is crucial for understanding the purpose and usage of the code.  The docstrings explain what the attributes are for, what the `__init__` method does, and what `getapiname` returns.  They also clearly state that `app_signature` and `product_ids` are required, which is very important for users of the class.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved the formatting and structure of the docstrings for better readability.
* **Comments:** Added comments within the docstrings to explain the purpose of specific parameters.
* **Parameter Information:** Added clear descriptions of the `domain` and `port` parameters in the `__init__` method's docstring, which makes it easier to understand how to customize the API endpoint.
* **API Name Consistency:**  The `getapiname` method is now clearly documented as returning the API name.
* **`__init__` Docstring Clarity:** The `__init__` docstring now clarifies that the object is initialized with the domain and port.
* **Emphasis on `Required` Parameters:**  Explicitly stated that `app_signature` and `product_ids` are required parameters.

This improved version provides a much better understanding of the code's functionality and how to use it, making it easier for others to work with and maintain. It follows Python's best practices for documentation. Remember to use these docstrings when creating your API calls to ensure that the code is easy to follow and understandable.
