# Tests for the MODE variable
def test_mode_is_dev():

    assert pw_executor.MODE == 'dev', "MODE variable should be 'dev'"

# Note:  There's no function or class to test in the provided code snippet.
#       The following tests are placeholders.  You need to adapt them to the

# Example test case (replace with actual function/class testing)
def test_function_not_implemented():
    """
    This test demonStartes a placeholder for testing a function that
    hasn't been implemented yet in the module, so it cannot be called,
    and will raise a NameError

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MODE`.  Therefore, the tests are minimal and focus on verifying the value of the constant.

**Crucially:** To write meaningful tests, you need the actual functions and classes from `hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py`.  The provided example tests are *not* comprehensive.  They are a *template* and should be replaced with specific tests that address the functionality present in the *actual* Python code file.

**How to adapt these tests:**

1. **Identify Functions/Classes:** Examine `pw_executor.py` for functions, methods, and classes.  Determine which ones require testing.

2. **Design Test Cases:**  For each function or class:
   - **Valid Input:** Provide appropriate input data and check if the output matches expected results.
   - **Invalid/Unexpected Input:**  Test scenarios with incorrect data types, out-of-bounds values, or missing data.  Use `pytest.raises` to verify expected exceptions.
   - **Edge Cases:**  Test the function's behavior near boundaries (e.g., maximum or minimum values, empty lists, etc.).
   - **Boundary Cases:** Values just outside the expected range (e.g., a list with one element more than the maximum allowed).

3. **Example Test (IlluStartive):**
   ```python
   import pytest
   import hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.pw_executor as pw_executor

   def test_my_function_with_valid_input():
       # Replace with your actual function call
       result = pw_executor.my_function(valid_input_data)
       expected_result = calculate_expected_result(valid_input_data)
       assert result == expected_result
   ```

4. **Fixtures (If Needed):**  Define fixtures to provide reusable test data if necessary:

   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def valid_input_data():
       return {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 123}
   ```

5. **Add Tests:**  Expand the `test_` function template to cover various aspects of your function.

**Example using pytest.raises (for exception handling):**
```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.pw_executor as pw_executor

def test_my_function_raises_exception_with_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        pw_executor.my_function(invalid_input_data)
    assert "Error message" in str(excinfo.value)
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `my_function`, `valid_input_data`, and `invalid_input_data` with the actual names from your `pw_executor.py` file.  Provide specific, detailed test cases for the logic in the code.
