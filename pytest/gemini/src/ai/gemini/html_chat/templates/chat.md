**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `$.ajax`:** The most crucial change is mocking the `$.ajax` function.  This allows us to control the behavior of the AJAX call without actually making a network request to a server.  This is essential for unit testing client-side JavaScript code.

* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions in the tests are now more focused on the *expected behavior* of the JavaScript code, rather than relying on side effects of directly interacting with HTML elements.

* **Comprehensive Scenarios:**  The tests cover valid input, an empty input (invalid), and a simulated server error/no response case.

* **`pytest.raises` (not needed):** `pytest.raises` is not necessary for these tests as they are focused on verifying the correct functionality and interactions within the JavaScript code.  The tests now rely on mocking the behavior instead of explicitly testing for exceptions that might or might not arise.

* **Error Handling:**  The `test_chat_form_submit_no_response` test now illustrates how to mock error conditions, where the server might not respond or return an error.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_chat.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_chat.py`

**Important Note:**  This revised approach is more appropriate for testing the JavaScript portion of the code in isolation.  To test server-side code related to the `/ask` endpoint, you'd write separate tests for the backend. Remember to use a separate testing environment (e.g., a test database) for your server-side tests to avoid interfering with your production environment.
