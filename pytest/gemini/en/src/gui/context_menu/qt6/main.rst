**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking PyQt6:** The critical part is mocking `QtWidgets.QMessageBox`.  Directly using the real `QMessageBox` would require a running PyQt6 application, making tests flaky and less isolated. The mock prevents those issues.

2. **Temporary Files:**  The `temp_script_file` fixture creates a temporary Python file for use in the `test_add_context_menu_item_valid_input` test. This is crucial because we don't want to modify the Windows registry with files that will remain after the test run.  Crucially, this fixture now properly cleans up the temporary directory after the test.

3. **Clearer Error Assertions:** The assertions now check for specific strings within the exception messages to ensure that the correct error messages are raised for different failure conditions (e.g., file not found, registry operation errors).

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The `pytest.raises` context manager is used correctly to check for expected exceptions.


5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The tests now include different scenarios (valid file, invalid file, non-existent registry key).  It's still a good idea to have more tests for various conditions.  Consider edge case scenarios like very long filenames or special characters in the filename.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code above in a file (e.g., `test_context_menu.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_context_menu.py`

**Important Considerations (For a Complete Testing Suite):**

* **Registry Validation:** Consider adding tests that verify if the registry key was actually created/deleted (or if its value is what you expect) after running the functions. This might require more sophisticated mocking.
* **Robust Error Handling:**  The current tests don't have exhaustive exception handling checks. Add tests for various possible errors (e.g., permission errors when accessing the registry).
* **External Dependencies:** If your code depends on external libraries or services, make sure you're mocking those dependencies for robust testing.
* **Adding `@pytest.mark.parametrize` (If applicable):**  If your functions accept multiple parameters, consider using `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for more efficient test coverage of various inputs.


By addressing these points, your tests will become even more comprehensive and reliable. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific expected behavior of your `add_context_menu_item` and `remove_context_menu_item` functions. Remember, thoroughly validating registry changes during testing is crucial to prevent subtle bugs that might manifest only under certain circumstances.
