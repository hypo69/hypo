### Module Overview: `src.scenario`

The `src.scenario` module is designed to automate interactions with suppliers using scenarios described in JSON files. Its primary task is to adapt the process of extracting and processing product data from supplier websites and synchronize this information with your system's database.

### Main Functions of the Module

1. **Read Scenarios**: The module loads scenarios from JSON files that contain information about various product categories and their URLs on the supplier's website.

2. **Interact with Websites**: Using the URLs specified in the scenarios, the module navigates to the product pages and extracts the necessary data.

3. **Process Data**: The module processes the extracted product data, converts it into the required format, and saves it into your system's database (e.g., PrestaShop).

4. **Logging Execution**: The module keeps a log of scenario executions, recording details of execution and results, which helps track success and identify errors.

### Main Components of the Module

1. **`run_scenario_files(s, scenario_files_list)`**:
   - Takes a list of scenario files and processes them sequentially.
   - Calls `run_scenario_file` to handle each scenario file.

2. **`run_scenario_file(s, scenario_file)`**:
   - Loads scenarios from the specified file and calls `run_scenario` for each scenario in the file.

3. **`run_scenario(s, scenario)`**:
   - Processes an individual scenario.
   - Navigates to the URL specified in the scenario and extracts product data.
   - Saves the extracted data into the database.

4. **`dump_journal(s, journal)`**:
   - Saves the execution log of scenarios to a file for later analysis.

5. **`main()`**:
   - Main function to run the module.

<End>

Example:
scenario_files_list = [file1.json, file2.json]
file1.json has 2 scenarios, file2.json has 1 scenario.
Workflow will load each scenario, execute the corresponding functions to fetch products, and insert into the DB. The journal will record success/failure details for each scenario execution.
```

```explanation
**Imports:**
No imports are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.  However, implicit imports from other Python modules are almost certainly used within functions like `execute_PrestaShop_insert` and those handling web scraping.  The `Path` object suggests use of the `pathlib` module for file handling.  The presence of asynchronous execution (`execute_PrestaShop_insert_async`) indicates a potential import for asynchronous operations.

**Classes:**
- **`Supplier`**:  This class likely encapsulates the logic for interacting with a particular supplier (e.g., AliExpress, HB Dead Sea).  Its methods (`run`, `run_scenario_files`, `run_scenario`, `current_scenario`) orchestrate the data collection and processing.  Attributes might include the supplier type, database connection details, or a list of available scenarios.
- **`Product`**:  This class likely represents a product and stores its attributes.  Methods might include methods for populating itself from data fetched from a website and methods for inserting data into the database.

**Functions:**
- **`run_scenario_files(s, scenario_files_list)`**:  Processes a list of scenario files sequentially, calling `run_scenario_file` for each.  Its input is a `Supplier` instance (`s`) and a list of file paths. Returns `True` on success and `False` on failure (likely to trigger error handling and logging).
- **`run_scenario_file(s, scenario_file)`**: Loads scenarios from a single file.  It passes each scenario to `run_scenario` and updates the execution journal.
- **`run_scenario(s, scenario)`**: Processes a single scenario.  This is the core function that fetches product data, saves it to the database, and logs execution. Its input is the `Supplier` instance and a dictionary containing the scenario details. Likely returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise, or a descriptive dictionary/list on error.
- **`dump_journal(s, journal)`**: Saves the current execution journal (`journal` being a dictionary-like object) to a JSON file.  Input is a `Supplier` instance (`s`) and the journal data.
- **`main()`**: The entry point of the script, initiating the scenario execution process. This is likely where the `Supplier` instance is created and the main execution loop is triggered.

**Variables:**
- `s`: `Supplier` instance, which manages supplier-specific data and actions.
- `scenario_files_list`: A list of file paths (or a single file path) containing the scenario definitions.
- `scenario`: A dictionary containing the details of a particular scenario (e.g., URL, category information).
- `journal`: A dictionary to keep track of the execution log.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**
- **Error Handling:** While the code mentions error logging, more robust error handling mechanisms are recommended (e.g., using `try...except` blocks to catch specific exceptions like `requests` errors, database connection failures, or invalid JSON data).  Detailed exception information should be recorded, including the scenario name and potentially the stack trace.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** The use of `execute_PrestaShop_insert_async` suggests handling data insertion asynchronously. This can improve performance, but proper error handling and ensuring data consistency are paramount.  The way asynchronous results are retrieved and checked is crucial.
- **Data Validation:** Data extracted from websites should be validated to ensure its correctness and prevent unexpected issues. Check if extracted data matches expected types.
- **Resource Management:** If the code interacts with external resources (e.g., web services, databases), proper resource management should be implemented (closing connections, releasing locks).
- **Robustness:**  The `insert_grabbed_data` function should handle multiple failure cases and potentially retry failed insertions, including checking if the product already exists in the database.
- **Concurrency:** If multiple scenarios are processed concurrently, concurrent access to shared resources (e.g., the database) must be carefully handled using locks or other concurrency control mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** The current approach might not be scalable for a very large number of scenarios and products. Consider using techniques for optimizing performance when dealing with a considerable volume of data.


**Relationships with Other Parts of the Project:**
The module relies on external components like the PrestaShop database and potentially web scraping libraries. The `Supplier` class and its `run` method would be the primary entry point. Likely other `src` modules or libraries would be responsible for interacting with the PrestaShop database or handling web requests.  There's an implicit dependency on these other `src` packages, as those libraries are called indirectly.
