How to Use the ai Module

This guide explains how to use the `ai` module for managing various AI models, interacting with external APIs, and configuring data analysis and language processing.

**Module Overview**

The `ai` module provides a structured approach to interacting with different AI models and APIs.  It simplifies model selection, prompt engineering, and integration.  This modular structure allows for specific model interactions and customization through different submodules.

**Submodule Usage**

The `ai` module comprises the following submodules:

**1. prompts:**

* **Purpose:** Creates and customizes prompts for AI models.  Tailoring prompts significantly affects the accuracy and relevance of model responses.
* **How to use:**  The `prompts` submodule likely contains functions for constructing prompts.  Refer to the detailed documentation within the `prompts` submodule for specific method names and parameters.  Example:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.prompts import create_prompt

prompt_text = create_prompt(model_type="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                            user_input="Translate this to French: Hello World")
print(prompt_text)
```

**2. anthropic:**

* **Purpose:** Integrates with Anthropic AI models.
* **How to use:**  Likely involves functions for initializing connections, generating responses, and managing Anthropic-specific parameters. Example:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.anthropic import generate_text

response = generate_text(prompt="Write a poem about...",
                        model="claude-instant")
print(response)
```


**3. dialogflow:**

* **Purpose:**  Integrates with Google Dialogflow for NLU and conversational AI.
* **How to use:**  Functions likely handle Dialogflow API calls, intent recognition, and entity extraction. Example:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.dialogflow import get_intent

intent_result = get_intent(user_query="book a flight to Paris")
print(intent_result)
```


**4. gemini:**

* **Purpose:** Manages connections with Gemini AI models.
* **How to use:**  Functions likely manage Gemini API keys and interactions, as well as model selection. Example:

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.gemini import generate_summary

summary = generate_summary(text="This is a very long article.", model="gemini-pro")
print(summary)
```

**5. helicone:**

* **Purpose:** Connects to Helicone models.
* **How to use:**  This likely involves methods to initialize a Helicone connection and run queries against their API.

**6. llama:**

* **Purpose:** Interfaces with LLaMA models.
* **How to use:**  Functions are likely structured similarly to other submodules, providing ways to interact with LLaMA models. Example (similar to gemini):

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.llama import generate_text

response = generate_text(prompt="Summarize this text...",
                         model="llama-2")
print(response)
```


**7. myai:**

* **Purpose:** Custom AI submodule for specific model configurations.
* **How to use:** This submodule requires specific implementation based on the project's unique model requirements.  Refer to the `myai` module's documentation for implementation details.


**8. openai:**

* **Purpose:** Integrates with OpenAI's API.
* **How to use:** Functions handle OpenAI API authentication, model selection, and API calls for tasks like text generation and classification. Example:


```python
from hypotez.src.ai.openai import generate_text

response = generate_text(prompt="Write a short story about...", model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
print(response)
```


**General Usage Notes:**

* **Authentication:**  Each submodule likely requires appropriate authentication (e.g., API keys) to connect to the respective AI provider.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your code to manage potential issues with API calls, model responses, or other external factors.
* **Documentation:** Always consult the detailed documentation within each submodule for precise method signatures, parameters, and expected return types.
