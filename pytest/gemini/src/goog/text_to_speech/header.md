```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Fixtures:** Added `settings_file` and `readme_file` fixtures to create temporary JSON and README files for the tests, simplifying test setup and avoiding modifying the original files.  Critically, these now use `tmp_path` from `pytest` which is the correct and standard practice for creating temporary files/directories in pytest.

2.  **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various scenarios:
    *   Valid project structure (`test_set_project_root_valid_input`)
    *   Project in a subdirectory (`test_set_project_root_project_in_subdirectory`)
    *   No marker file (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_file`)
    *   Marker file in a parent directory (`test_set_project_root_marker_file_in_parent`)
    *   `sys.path` manipulation check (`test_set_project_root_with_sys_path`)
    *   Passing different types of marker files (`test_set_project_root_marker_files_tuple`)
    *   Invalid marker files. (`test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_files`)
    * **Crucially:** `test_settings_file_not_found` to test the exception handling when `settings.json` is missing.


3.  **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` within `settings` and `doc_str` loading.

4.  **Clarity and Readability:** Improved the naming and structure of test functions for better understanding of their purpose. Added clear docstrings to explain the purpose of each test.

5.  **Correct `sys.path` Handling:** Added a test to verify the insertion of the root directory into `sys.path`. This is now **crucially restored**, which was missing in the previous version.  This prevents unintended side effects when running multiple tests.

6. **Error Handling for Invalid Settings:** Added a test (`test_settings_file_not_found`) to ensure the code gracefully handles the `FileNotFoundError` in the case where `settings.json` doesn't exist.

This revised solution now covers a broader range of scenarios and more thoroughly tests the `set_project_root` function, making it more robust and reliable. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging` if you haven't already.
