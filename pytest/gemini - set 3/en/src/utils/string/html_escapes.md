**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover various aspects, including valid inputs, edge cases (special characters, Unicode), missing keys, empty strings, and non-string inputs.

2. **Error Handling with `pytest.raises`:** The tests use `pytest.raises` to check for `KeyError` and `TypeError` exceptions, demonStarting robust exception handling.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names are descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

4. **Edge Cases and Boundary Cases:** The tests specifically address edge cases (special characters, Unicode) and boundary conditions.  The added `test_html_escapes_large_input` is a good example of handling a potentially large input.

5. **Example Usage:** The code assumes the `html_escapes` dictionary is defined in a file named `html_escapes.py`, and imports it correctly. The `try-except` block handles potential import errors gracefully, making the tests more robust.



**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_html_escapes.py`) in the same directory as `html_escapes.py`.

2.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_html_escapes.py`:

```bash
pytest test_html_escapes.py
```

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage and demonStartes better practices for writing robust and reliable tests. Remember to adapt the `large_string_key` in `test_html_escapes_large_input` to a suitable large string if needed.  If a different key size is expected to cause an issue in the actual function, update the test to use that key size instead. Remember to adapt the test cases to reflect the specific characteristics and error conditions in the `html_escapes` function you're testing.
