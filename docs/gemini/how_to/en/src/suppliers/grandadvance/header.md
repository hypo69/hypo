# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/header.py`

This file sets up the project environment and loads configuration details.  It's crucial for other parts of the `hypotez` project to function correctly.

## Functionality

The script primarily aims to:

1. **Find the Project Root:** It determines the root directory of the `hypotez` project by searching upwards from the script's location, looking for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). This is important for correctly referencing modules and other project resources.

2. **Add the Root Directory to `sys.path`:**  Once found, it appends the project root to the Python path (`sys.path`). This enables Python to import modules from the project without needing explicit paths.

3. **Load Project Settings:** It attempts to load configuration data from a `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory of the project root.  The loaded settings are stored in the `settings` variable.

4. **Load Project Documentation:**  It attempts to load documentation from a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory. The loaded content is stored in the `doc_str` variable.

5. **Define Project Metadata:** It extracts various project details (project name, version, author, etc.) from the `settings.json` file, providing default values if the file is missing or the relevant fields are absent.  These details are stored in variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc., for later use.


## How to Use

This file is typically *not* directly called by the user.  It's an internal utility function used by other parts of the `hypotez` project.  The key parts users might need to interact with are:

* **`__root__` (Path):**  This variable holds the absolute path to the project root, which is critical for accessing project resources, loading settings, etc.  It's set by calling the `set_project_root()` function.  Other modules in the project should utilize this variable for absolute paths.

* **`settings` (dict):** This dictionary contains configuration data loaded from `settings.json`.

* **`__version__`, `__project_name__`, etc.:** These variables hold important project metadata.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The script includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during file loading.  This ensures the script doesn't crash if the `settings.json` or `README.MD` files are missing or have incorrect format.

* **Default Values:** Default values are provided for project metadata in case `settings.json` is missing or a particular key isn't found.  This is crucial for robustness.

* **`gs.path.root`:** The script relies on the `gs.path.root` object.  Make sure this object is defined and points to the correct project root within your `src` module.

* **`sys.path` modification:**  Adding the project root to `sys.path` is a powerful but often-overlooked feature. Ensure this is the intended behavior; in some cases, you might want to avoid modifying `sys.path` globally, especially in production environments.

* **Project Structure:** The script assumes a specific directory structure (`src/settings.json`, `src/README.MD`). Ensure this structure aligns with your actual project.
