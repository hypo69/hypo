**Instructions for Code Documentation Generation**

1. **Analyze the code**: Understand the logic and actions performed by the given code block.
  
2. **Create a step-by-step guide**:
    - **Description**: Explain what the code block does.
    - **Execution steps**: Outline the sequence of actions in the code.
    - **Usage example**: Provide a code example showing how to use this block in a project.

3. **Formatting**: Follow the structure in `reStructuredText (RST)`:

```rst
