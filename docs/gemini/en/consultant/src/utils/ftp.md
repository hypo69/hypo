.. module: src.utils 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

# Changes Made

*   Added comprehensive RST-style documentation to all functions.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (assuming `j_loads` exists in `src.utils.jjson`).
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` import.
*   Corrected inconsistent use of `try-except` blocks; replaced with `logger.error` for error handling.
*   Improved error messages in `logger.error` statements.
*   Removed unnecessary comments and examples.
*   Removed unnecessary `Path` imports since it's not used.
*   Added type hints for improved code clarity and maintainability.
*   Made `delete` function more concise, focused on server-side operation (removed unnecessary `source_file_path` parameter).
*   Added error handling with `logger` for robustness.
*   Clarified parameter descriptions in docstrings (e.g., file paths).
*   Corrected return types (`bool` or `Union[str, bytes, None]`).
*   Made parameter names more descriptive (e.g., `dest_dir` instead of `dest_path`).
*   Improved exception handling for clearer error messages.
*   Added `FileNotFoundError` as a potential exception in `write`.
