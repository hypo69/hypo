**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Import `gspread`:**  Crucially, the code now imports the `gspread` library.  Without this, you won't be able to interact with the Google Sheets API.  This is a fundamental fix.
* **Error Handling (`try...except`):**  The `get` method now includes a `try...except` block to catch `gspread.exceptions.APIError`. This is **vital** for robustness.  If there's a problem connecting to Google Sheets or a similar error, the script won't crash. Instead, it prints an informative error message.
* **`sh` as `Spreadsheet`:**  The `sh` parameter in `__init__` and `get` is now correctly typed as `Spreadsheet`. This is better practice and helps catch potential type errors.
* **`rows` and `cols` as optional:** The `rows` and `cols` parameters are now explicitly set to `None` by default. This matches better to how they are used to control whether the sheet should be created or not, rather than specifying the number of rows and columns in all scenarios.  Using `None` avoids potential errors if a user doesn't pass in the values.
* **`self.sh` initialization:**  The `self.sh` member is correctly initialized within the `__init__` method.
* **Explicit `title` in `add_worksheet`:** When creating a new worksheet, `add_worksheet` now takes a `title` argument. This is crucial to ensure the worksheet is created correctly.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Replaced `_ws` with `self.ws` for better readability and consistency.  Variables like `ws_title` are more descriptive.
* **Removed Unnecessary Comments:** Some redundant comments have been removed for clarity.


**How to Use:**

1. **Install `gspread`:**
   ```bash
   pip install gspread
   ```

2. **Enable Google Sheets API:**  Follow the instructions in the `gspread` documentation to enable the Google Sheets API in your Google Cloud project.

3. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `'[Your Google Sheets credentials]'` with your actual credentials (e.g., from a service account).

4. **Example Usage (within a larger script):**

```python
from global_settingspread import Spreadsheet
# ... (rest of your imports)

# ... (your setup/credentials) ...

# Create a Spreadsheet object (assuming you have a 'Spreadsheet' class)
spreadsheet = Spreadsheet(credentials=YOUR_CREDENTIALS, spreadsheet_id=YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID)

# Create a GWorksheet object
worksheet = GWorksheet(spreadsheet, ws_title='My Worksheet', rows=100, cols=20)

# ... (your operations using the worksheet object) ...
```

This revised code is more robust, handles potential errors, and adheres to better Python coding practices. Remember to adjust the `global_settingspread` part to match your environment.  If `global_settingspread` is not handling the spreadsheet credentials, you'll need to pass in the relevant authentication information to the `GWorksheet` constructor.  Good luck!
