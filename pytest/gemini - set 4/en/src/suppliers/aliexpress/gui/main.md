```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `QFileDialog`:** The `test_open_file_valid_file` test now correctly mocks `QFileDialog`.  Crucially, it patches the `QtWidgets.QFileDialog` class itself to return a mocked object, avoiding issues with interactions with PyQt.

2. **Handling Cancelled File Selection:** The `test_open_file_no_file` test now verifies that the code doesn't crash if the user cancels the file selection dialog.  This is a key edge case.

3. **Invalid File Handling:** `test_open_file_invalid_file` tests the scenario where the user selects a file that is not a JSON file.   The test now uses a mock to simulate the issue and checks if the error message box is displayed.


4. **Complete Test Cases:**  This solution needs further test cases. You should add tests for `save_file`, `copy`, `paste`, `exit_application`, and any other relevant methods. These should follow the same pattern of mocking appropriate objects and testing for expected behavior in various scenarios (valid input, invalid input, empty input, etc.)


5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are improved to be more specific about the expected outcomes.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_main.py`).
3. Run `pytest test_main.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Mock `j_loads_ns`:** Add mocking for the `j_loads_ns` function.  If this function makes external calls to a file or network resource, mocking will be crucial to preventing errors during testing.
* **Mock UI Interactions:** PyQt's UI elements often require careful mocking.  Using the appropriate mocking tools is vital to ensure that tests only focus on the logic being tested without relying on PyQt's event handling.
* **Error Handling:** Tests for error handling (e.g., invalid JSON format) should ensure proper error messages or exceptions are raised as expected when `j_loads_ns` fails or file operations fail.
* **Additional Tests:** Create tests for all significant functions and edge cases in the `MainApp` class.


Remember to adapt the mocks to the specific methods and functionalities of your code. The provided examples are starting points and need to be tailored to your `main.py` file.
