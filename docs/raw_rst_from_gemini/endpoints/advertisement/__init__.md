**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the module and the functions `get_version` and `get_details`. This is crucial for documentation.  The example docstrings show how to write clear and concise explanations for what the code does.
2. **`get_version` and `get_details` functions:** Created functions to access the version and details from `__version__` and `__details__` which is a better structured approach for retrieving the version and details.  This is an example and you might have different ways you want to access/present these.
3. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block (example):** Added an example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This block is executed only when the module is run directly (not imported as a module). It demonstrates how to use the `get_version` and `get_details` functions, providing a quick way to check the module functionality.  You can remove this block if you don't need this example usage in the file.

**Why these changes are important for `doc_creator` role:**

* **Clarity and Maintainability:** Docstrings make the code more understandable, helping maintainers and others using the code to grasp its purpose and usage quickly.
* **Automated Documentation:** Tools like Sphinx can parse the docstrings to automatically generate API documentation (e.g., HTML pages).
* **Improved Readability:** Clearer, more concise docstrings improve the overall readability of the module.
* **Usability:** The `get_version` and `get_details` functions make it easier for other parts of the application to retrieve important information about the advertisement module.

Remember to replace the example docstrings with specific details about your advertisement endpoints. Also, adjust the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to your needs.


**Example Usage (in another python file):**

```python
import hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement

version = hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.get_version()
details = hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.get_details()

print(f"Advertisement module version: {version}")
print(f"Advertisement module details: {details}")
```
