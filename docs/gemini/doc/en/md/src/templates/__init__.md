# Module: hypotez/src/templates/__init__.py

## Overview

This module initializes the `templates` directory, likely containing various template files or classes for use in the Hypotez project. It defines a global variable `MODE` and imports necessary components, including versioning information from the `version.py` file.

## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable likely defining the current operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Imports

This section details the imported modules.

- `header`:  Implied as a module within the same package or potentially a separate module, likely containing initial setup or configuration information.  Further clarification is needed for detailed documentation.


- `packaging.version`: Imports the `Version` class for version handling.

- `templates.version`: Imports versioning related variables like `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`.


## Notes

- The module contains several multi-line docstrings, some with missing or incomplete details.  Expand these docstrings to include descriptions of their purpose.
- The `...` indicates that code is omitted in this file, which is common for Python modules that handle many imports. Please provide the complete code of the files involved.


- More detailed documentation of the purposes of the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` variables from `templates.version` is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of their use.
- The section containing comments starting with """"...""" needs a description of the module's operation.


## TODOs

- Expand the descriptions of the imported modules (`header`).
- Detail the functionality of the imported `templates.version` module.
-  Provide a description of the module's operation using the comments marked "HERE SHOULD BE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULE OPERATION !".
-  Document the complete file to include all functions, classes, and variables.
