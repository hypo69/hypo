# Module: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/sergey_mymaster_co_il/__init__.py

## Overview

This module initializes the PrestaShop endpoint for the `sergey_mymaster_co_il` domain.  It likely defines configuration variables and potentially imports necessary components for interacting with the PrestaShop API for this specific domain.


## Configuration Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: This variable likely defines the operational mode of the endpoint, such as 'dev' (development) or 'prod' (production).

**Value**: 'dev' (as per the code).

## Module Documentation


This module, `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/sergey_mymaster_co_il/__init__.py`, appears to be a configuration module. It sets a `MODE` variable, presumably for use in other parts of the codebase to determine the execution environment for the PrestaShop endpoint handling the `sergey_mymaster_co_il` domain.  The presence of the docstrings indicates an intent for documentation, but the docstrings themselves are quite rudimentary and lack detailed explanations that would be useful in a comprehensive API reference.
