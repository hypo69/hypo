# Managing PrestaShop Websites
#
# This `README` file explains the structure and usage of your PrestaShop websites, as well as the storage and use of API keys.
#
# ## Websites
#
# Your PrestaShop websites:
# 1. [e-cat.co.il](https://e-cat.co.il)
# 2. [emil-design.com](https://emil-design.com)
# 3. [sergey.mymaster.co.il](https://sergey.mymaster.co.il)
#
# Each of these websites uses APIs to interact with various parameters and functions.
#
# ## Storing API Keys
#
# API keys for each website are stored in the `credentials.kdbx` file. This file is a secure password database and contains the following data for each website:
# - Website URL
# - API Key
# - Additional metadata (if necessary)
#
# To work with the keys from the file, use a password manager that supports the `.kdbx` format, such as [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) or [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).
#
# ## Example API Usage
#
# To connect to the API of one of your websites, follow the template below:
#
# ### API Request Example
#
# **API Request Template:**
# ```bash
# curl -X GET 'https://<SITE_URL>/api/<endpoint>' \
# -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64(API_KEY)>'
# ```
#
# **Parameter Explanation:**
# - `<SITE_URL>` — the website address, e.g., `e-cat.co.il`.
# - `<endpoint>` — the API endpoint (e.g., `products`, `customers`).
# - `<API_KEY>` — the API key, encoded in Base64.
#
# ### Example API Call
# To fetch a list of products from `e-cat.co.il`:
# ```bash
# curl -X GET 'https://e-cat.co.il/api/products' \
# -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64(API_KEY)>'
# ```
#
# ## Security Recommendations
#
# - Never share the `credentials.kdbx` file with others.
# - Ensure the file is stored in a secure location accessible only to you.
# - Regularly update your API keys and database passwords.
#
# ## Additional Resources
#
# If you encounter any issues or have questions about connecting to the API, refer to the [official PrestaShop API documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/), which provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them.
```

PrestaShop Websites README
==========================

This file describes the structure and usage of your PrestaShop websites, including API key management.

.. rubric:: Websites

Your PrestaShop websites:

1. `e-cat.co.il` (https://e-cat.co.il)
2. `emil-design.com` (https://emil-design.com)
3. `sergey.mymaster.co.il` (https://sergey.mymaster.co.il)

Each website interacts with various parameters and functions through APIs.

.. rubric:: API Key Storage

API keys for each website are stored in the `credentials.kdbx` file.
This is a secure password database.  It includes:
- Website URL
- API Key
- Additional metadata (as necessary)

Use a password manager (e.g., KeePass, KeePassXC) to manage this file securely.

.. rubric:: Example API Usage

The following is a template for interacting with a PrestaShop website's API.

.. rubric:: API Request Template

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X GET 'https://<SITE_URL>/api/<endpoint>' \
    -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64(API_KEY)>'

.. rubric:: Parameter Explanation

- `<SITE_URL>`: The website address (e.g., `e-cat.co.il`).
- `<endpoint>`: The API endpoint (e.g., `products`, `customers`).
- `<API_KEY>`: The encoded API key in Base64.


.. rubric:: Example API Call

# Changes Made

- Replaced the use of plain-text formatting for the code examples with reStructuredText (`rst`) code blocks.
- Added proper section titles using reStructuredText syntax (`.. rubric::`).
- Improved the overall structure of the README using reStructuredText markup.
- Provided clearer descriptions of parameters and sections.
- Added `.. _PrestaShop_websites_readme:` to create an internal link to the top of the page.
