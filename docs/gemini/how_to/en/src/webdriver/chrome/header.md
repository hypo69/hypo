**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling.  Crucially, `set_project_root` now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the project root cannot be found, making the function more reliable.  It also catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading settings and the README.  Prints informative warnings to the console.
* **Explicit Imports:** Improved import statements, avoiding circular imports, making the file less error-prone. Imports `gs` using a fully qualified path from the current location.  The `gs` import now uses the variable `current_path` correctly in order to import the correct module.
* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open` call when reading the README.  This is important for handling files with different character encodings.
* **Default Values:** If `settings.json` or `README.MD` is missing, the code now sets appropriate default values (`__doc__ = ""`, `__version__ = ""`, etc.) instead of using `None`.
* **Readability and Clarity:** Added comments to explain the purpose of sections and variables. Improved variable names and formatting for better readability.
* **Correct `Path` usage:** Corrected the use of `Path` in setting the path.
* **Docstring improvement:** Added a more detailed docstring to the module.
* **Explicit `__root__` error handling:**  Removed the unnecessary `__root__` variable used to store the result of `set_project_root`. The returned `Path` object itself is used for correct path handling.
* **Corrected `sys.path` insertion:**  The `sys.path` insertion is done correctly now, inserting the root directory path at the beginning (`sys.path.insert(0, ...)`).

This revised code is significantly more robust, handles potential errors gracefully, and adheres to best practices for Python programming. Remember to place the `src` directory containing `gs.py` and other modules in the same level directory as the files in your `hypotez` project.
