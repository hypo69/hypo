Changes Made
```

- Added a docstring in RST format for the `parse_json` function, including type hints and exception handling.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for reading JSON files.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` and custom exceptions for better error reporting.
- Added necessary imports (e.g., `from src.logger import logger`).
- Added `j_loads_ns` import if it's used.

**Important Considerations:**

- The provided `Received Code` snippet is incomplete and doesn't include the necessary `src` directory structure.  To make this runnable, you need to create the `src/utils/jjson.py` module and define the `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` functions.
-  I've added a basic example of how to use `logger.error` and handle exceptions.  You'll need to add more robust error handling to your actual functions.
- The `...` placeholders need to be filled in with the rest of the code from the `Received Code`.
- Make sure you've installed the necessary packages (`requests`, `json`, etc.) if they are listed in the `requirements.txt`.
