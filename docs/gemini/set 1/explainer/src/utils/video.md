""" This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.  It includes error handling and logging for robust operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Handles file not found and read errors.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')  # or None if failed

    >>> data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

# <algorithm>

**save_video_from_url(url, save_path):**

1. Takes a URL and save path as input.
2. Creates a `ClientSession` for asynchronous HTTP requests.
3. Issues a GET request to the URL.
4. **Error Handling:** Checks for HTTP errors (e.g., 404) using `response.raise_for_status()`.
5. Creates parent directories for the save path if they don't exist using `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
6. Opens the save path in binary write mode (`"wb"`) using `aiofiles`.
7. Reads the response content in chunks of 8192 bytes using a `while` loop.
8. Writes each chunk to the file.
9. **Crucial Checks:**
   - Checks if the file was actually saved (`save_path.exists()`).
   - Checks if the file size is zero (`save_path.stat().st_size == 0`).  If either check fails, the function returns `None`.
10. Returns the `Path` object if the download and save succeed, or `None` otherwise.
11. **Error Handling:** Catches `aiohttp.ClientError` (network problems) and other general exceptions (`Exception`).


**get_video_data(file_name):**

1. Takes a file name as input.
2. Checks if the file exists using `Path(file_name).exists()`.
3. If the file exists, opens it in binary read mode (`"rb"`) using the `with open` statement (ensures file is closed).
4. Reads the entire file content into a byte string using `file.read()`.
5. Returns the byte string, or `None` if the file is not found or an error occurs during reading.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client library for making requests to download the video.
- `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file I/O library for saving the video locally.
- `pathlib`: For working with file paths in a platform-independent way.
- `typing`: For type hinting (e.g., `Optional[Path]`).
- `asyncio`: For asynchronous operations.
- `logger`: Custom logging module (`src.logger`) is used for reporting errors. This is a crucial part of maintaining structured logging across the project, enhancing debugging, and providing crucial information about the process.


**Classes:**

- None.  The code uses no custom classes.


**Functions:**

- `save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]`: Downloads a video from a given URL and saves it to the specified local path asynchronously. It handles various potential errors during the download and saving process, including network issues, file saving failures, and empty files.  Crucially, it also checks for errors after saving, making it much more robust.
- `get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]`: Reads the binary data from a video file. Returns `None` if the file does not exist or if there are errors during reading.


**Variables:**

- `MODE`: A string that likely defines the operation mode of the application.
- `url`, `save_path`: Strings representing the URL to download from and the local save path for the video.
- `chunk`: Bytes representing a chunk of the video data read in the download process (used for memory efficiency).
- `save_path`: `Path` object representing the local video file after downloading.  Crucially used for platform-independent operations.
- `file_path`: `Path` object for representing the video file in the `get_video_data` function.  Again, crucial for platform-independence.


**Possible Improvements:**

- **More specific error handling:** Provide more detailed error messages in the logger (e.g., HTTP error codes instead of just "Network error").
- **Progress reporting:** Add progress indicators to `save_video_from_url` to show the download progress.
- **Retry mechanism:** Add a retry mechanism in `save_video_from_url` for transient network issues.  This would allow the program to retry the download a few times if it fails.
- **Input validation:** Validate the input `url` and `save_path` to prevent potential issues.
- **File Locking (Optional):** Consider file locking if multiple processes might try to save to the same file simultaneously (highly unlikely for this use-case, but potentially good practice).


**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

The `src.logger` module is directly linked, showing dependency on this module to handle logging and error reporting. This demonStartes the module's role as a utility within a larger project, potentially handling downloads for different content types.
