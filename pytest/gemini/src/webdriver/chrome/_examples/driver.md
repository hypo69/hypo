**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Crucial for testing parts of the code that interact with external resources (like the browser). I've used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock methods that interact with the browser and file system.  This isolates the test from actual browser interactions, making it fast and reliable.


2. **Clearer Assertions:** Instead of just checking for `True` or `False` for function returns, I've added more specific assertions. For example, checking if the expected element was found, and if a specific exception was raised.


3. **Fixture Creation:** I've created two simple fixtures for URLs (valid and invalid) to make the tests easier to read and more reusable.  You'll likely need to create fixtures to provide data based on your actual code's requirements.


4. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for invalid URLs, invalid selectors, and potential exceptions that the code might encounter.


5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The tests now cover a wider range of scenarios, ensuring robust test coverage for various inputs and error conditions.



**Important Considerations:**

- **Replace Mock Objects:** The current mock objects are placeholders. Replace the patch destinations (`'src.webdriver.chrome._examples.driver.Driver._save_cookies_localy'`) with the actual method names as required by your code.


- **Dependencies:** Ensure that you have the necessary libraries (like `pytest` and `selenium`) installed.


- **Driver Setup:**  Real browser automation requires setting up a WebDriver instance correctly. This code assumes you are using a `Chrome` driver.  You'll need to install the `selenium` package to run the tests.


- **Error Handling:** The original code doesn't explicitly handle errors. Your tests should check for proper exception handling in your production code.  I've added a `pytest.raises` for expected exceptions.


- **Actual Data:** Replace the placeholder `valid_url` and `invalid_url` fixtures with more realistic data from your data sources.


- **Real Browser Interaction:** For complete tests, consider using a different type of mocking or running your tests with a real browser if possible, but use caution in this scenario!  Running tests with a real browser can take a lot longer due to setup and tear-down time.
