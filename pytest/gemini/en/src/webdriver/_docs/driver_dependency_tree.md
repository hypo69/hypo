**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Driver:**  Crucially, I've created a `MockDriver` class.  This is *essential* for testing these methods without requiring a real browser.  This example uses `selenium.webdriver.Chrome()` for now, but replace this with your actual driver initialization.

2. **`pytest.fixture` for Driver:** The `driver` fixture now correctly creates and quits the driver instance within the test scope.

3. **Specific Exception Handling:**  Test `test_click_element_not_found` catches the `NoSuchElementException`, which is the likely error if the element isn't found.  You should adjust error checking to catch the *actual* exceptions raised by your driver implementation.

4. **Method Existence Checks:** I've added checks (`assert hasattr(driver, "method_name")`) to ensure the methods you're testing actually exist in the `driver` object. This is crucial for preventing `AttributeError` in cases where your driver class doesn't have all these methods.


5. **More Test Cases Needed:** The provided code structure is a starting point.  You need to add many more test cases for `execute_locator`, `click`, `get_attribute_by_locator`, `get_url`, `page_refresh`, etc., thoroughly testing various scenarios.


**How to run:**

1. Install pytest:  `pip install pytest`
2. Replace `MockDriver` with your actual driver initialization (e.g., `from src.webdriver import Chrome`).
3. Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_driver.py`).
4. Run the tests: `pytest test_driver.py`


This improved solution addresses the missing driver instantiation, provides more realistic testing behavior, and is ready for you to expand into comprehensive test cases. Remember to replace placeholders with your specific code and exception types. Remember to adapt the tests to your specific driver implementation.
