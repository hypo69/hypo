**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The `mock_driver` fixture now effectively mocks `Driver` and `Chrome`, preventing real interactions with a web browser during testing. This is crucial for unit testing, making tests faster and more reliable.

2. **Parameterization:** The `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_invalid_input` test now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with different types of invalid input (None, empty list, string).  This makes the test more comprehensive.

3. **Explicit Exception Handling:** The `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_keyboard_interrupt` tests explicitly checks for the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception, and the test now correctly mocks the `logger.info` call.

4. **File Existence Check (Important):**  The `test_file_paths` test and the `file_exists` fixture are critical.  The original code assumes the JSON files exist.  This test now checks if the files exist, raising a `ValueError` if they're missing. This prevents your tests from failing unpredictably.  The `scope="module"` ensures this only happens once per test run, not repeatedly. This is necessary, as the filenames variable is now tested.

5. **Comprehensive Input Validation:** The `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_invalid_input` test covers various potential `run_campaigns` input errors.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_start_posting_katia.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run `pytest test_start_posting_katia.py` from your terminal.

This improved test suite provides a more robust and realistic test coverage for the provided code, making your code more reliable and maintainable. Remember to adapt the error handling and expected exceptions based on the actual behavior of the functions. If `run_campaign` raises a specific exception, adapt the test to reflect that.
