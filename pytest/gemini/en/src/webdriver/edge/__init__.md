**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  The code now correctly imports the `pytest` library.

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  The code now uses `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).  This is *essential* for robust exception handling.  The examples have been updated to demonstrate correct usage.

3. **Fixtures for Edge Instance:** A `pytest.fixture` `edge_instance` is created.  This is crucial for testing `Edge` methods in isolation.  You might need to initialize this `edge_instance` correctly within the fixture if your `Edge` class needs specific initialization parameters or external dependencies (e.g., a browser).

4. **Clear Test Descriptions:** Test names are improved for clarity.

5. **Example Assertions:** The example assertions (`assert isinstance`, `assert edge_instance.is_started`) show how to verify various conditions.  *You need to adjust these to the actual behavior of your `Edge` class.*  If `edge_instance.get()` returns a different type, or raises an exception, you must use the appropriate assertion and exception handling accordingly.

6. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** Example `test_edge_start_invalid_input` and `test_edge_get_invalid_url` show how to handle invalid input, simulating edge cases.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Save the tests:** Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_edge.py`).
2. **Run the tests:** From your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_edge.py` and run `pytest test_edge.py`.

**Crucial Next Steps (Replace placeholders):**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The example assertions (`assert edge_instance.is_started`, the error message in the examples, and the invalid input handling) are placeholders.  Adapt them to your `Edge` class's actual structure and methods to verify the actual logic of the driver.

* **Complete `Edge` Class Methods:** The example tests assume your `Edge` class has methods like `start`, `stop`, `get`.  If you use different methods (or attributes), you will need to add tests accordingly.

* **Realistic Initialization:** Ensure your `edge_instance` fixture correctly initializes the `Edge` class with the proper arguments.

* **Implement Error Handling:** The exception handling examples show basic mechanisms. Adapt them to your specific error cases and messages.


By incorporating these improvements, your tests will be more comprehensive, robust, and helpful in identifying potential issues in your `Edge` driver implementation. Remember to add more tests as needed to cover all critical aspects of the class. Remember to test with different valid inputs, expected and unexpected outputs, and edge cases where appropriate, and to always handle exceptions in a way that leads to meaningful results.
