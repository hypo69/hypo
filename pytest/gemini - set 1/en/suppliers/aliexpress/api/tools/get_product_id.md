**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive, making the purpose of each test clearer.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test `ProductIdNotFoundException`.  This is crucial for exception handling.
* **Parameterization:**  Uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` for better test coverage, particularly for `extract_prod_ids` to handle more valid and invalid inputs.
* **Robustness:** Includes tests for empty strings and non-numeric inputs.  These are crucial edge cases to ensure the function behaves correctly under various conditions.
* **Specific Exception Check:**  The `test_get_product_id_missing_id` and `test_get_product_id_invalid_input` tests now check for the *specific* type of `AttributeError` raised, which is more informative for debugging.  This also demonStartes better error handling when no product ID can be found within a URL or an invalid input is provided.  The previous assertion was looking for a string that may or may not appear.
* **Correct Usage of `extract_prod_ids`:** The tests now directly call `extract_prod_ids` instead of making assumptions about `get_product_id`'s internal logic. This is necessary as the original implementation of `get_product_id` was calling `extract_prod_ids`. Now the tests explicitly test `extract_prod_ids` using various inputs to ensure its correctness and to confirm the expected outputs.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, accurate, and directly addresses the requirements of the prompt. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`. Then, run the tests using `pytest`.  The output will show whether each test passed or failed, providing valuable debugging information.
