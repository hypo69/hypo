**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Mock Data:** Introduced `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary JSON and README files.  This isolates the tests from the real file system and prevents polluting the test environment.

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:**  Correctly used `pytest.raises` to check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during settings loading.

3. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test names are more descriptive, reflecting the test case.

4. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Used `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary directories for testing.  This is crucial for reliable tests that don't affect the project's actual files.

5. **Parameterization:** Added `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test `set_project_root` with different marker file options, improving test coverage.


6. **Import `gs`:** Added `import gs` for the test.
7. **Import `sys`:** Added `import sys` for test `test_set_project_root_no_marker_file()`.
8. **Realistic Root Path:**  The test `test_settings_loading_success` now directly sets up the mock `settings.json` and uses `Path(".")` to resolve `root_dir`, mimicking the expected behavior of `set_project_root()`.
9. **Cleanup:** The `teardown_module` function is added to remove temporary files created by the fixtures, ensuring tests run independently. This is crucial for a reliable test suite.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides more complete and robust test coverage, correctly addressing exception handling and mocking required data. Remember to replace `gs.path` with a suitable implementation in the test if `gs` is part of your project. Remember to adapt this code to your project structure as needed.
