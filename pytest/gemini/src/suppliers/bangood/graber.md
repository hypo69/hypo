```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The solution now heavily utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `logger` objects. This isolates the tests and prevents them from interacting with the actual web driver or logger, which is crucial for reliable testing.  Crucially, `mock.MagicMock` is used to mock the `Driver` class properly to simulate its methods like `execute_locator`

2. **Fixtures:**  The `driver_mock` and `graber` fixtures are used to create and manage the mocks, promoting code reuse and better organization.

3. **`pytest.raises` (important):** The example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.  This is crucial when the tested code might raise exceptions, like an `ExecuteLocatorException`

4. **Clear Test Cases:** The test cases are designed with clear names (`test_init`, `test_close_pop_up_decorator_not_implemented`) and descriptions, which improves readability and understanding.

5. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code is extremely basic, so I've added placeholder tests like `test_init`. You *must* add tests that cover methods that you actually have in the `Graber` class (e.g., `process_field`, `collect_data`, etc.).

6. **Decorator Test:** The crucial test `test_close_pop_up_decorator_not_implemented` checks that the decorator doesn't run if it isn't implemented (this is likely a desired behavior).

7. **`@patch` for logger:**  Uses `@patch` to mock the logger, allowing controlled logging for testing.

**How to run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run `pytest test_graber.py` from your terminal in the directory containing `test_graber.py` and the source code `hypotez/src/suppliers/bangood/graber.py`.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder methods and examples (`some_method`, `valid_input`, `expected_output`, etc.) with the actual methods and expected behavior from your `Graber` class.
- **Edge Cases:** Add tests to cover edge cases for each method (e.g., empty inputs, special characters).
- **Exception Handling:** Add tests to confirm that exceptions are handled correctly, using `pytest.raises` as illustrated.
- **External Dependencies:** Be sure to properly mock any external libraries or dependencies that your `Graber` class uses (like the `Driver` class).
