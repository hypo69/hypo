**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `Path.exists`:** Critically important for testing `set_project_root`.  This allows you to control whether files exist or not without actually creating/modifying files on the filesystem.  This makes the tests much more robust and avoids problems with external dependencies or file system state.

* **Parameterization:** The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to test `set_project_root` with various combinations of marker files, making the tests more comprehensive.

* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Added a test `test_settings_file_not_found` to demonstrate how to test for `FileNotFoundError`.  This is a crucial addition, as the original code had no proper exception handling.

* **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test names now better indicate the purpose of the test.

* **Fixture Placeholders:**  Crucially, the code now includes *placeholder* test functions for the `settings` and `doc_str` handling.  You'll need to adapt these placeholders to actually test the loading and use of those variables.  Mock the return value of `gs.path.root` to avoid real file access in those tests.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Adapt the placeholder tests (`test_settings_file_not_found`, etc.) to accurately reflect the logic in the `header.py` file and the expected behavior when `settings.json` or `README.MD` files are not found or contain invalid data.
2. **Implement Missing Fixtures:**  Create fixtures (`settings_data`, `readme_data`, etc.) to provide mock data for `settings.json` and `README.MD` (or directly mock the file reads using `patch`).
3. **Add More Specific Tests:** Write tests for edge cases like empty or malformed `settings.json` files, files with missing keys, etc.
4. **Refactoring (Optional):** Consider how the functions can be reorganized to be more easily testable. Often, functions can be split into smaller, more focused functions.

By addressing these points, your test suite will be far more comprehensive and will cover more possible failure conditions. Remember to replace the placeholders with real tests to achieve a complete test coverage for your `header.py` file. Also, adjust mocking based on the actual dependencies in your code. Remember to adapt to your specific project structure.
