**Explanation of improvements and why they were made:**

1. **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the functions `get_version` and `is_version_greater_equal`. This is crucial for documentation and allowing users to understand how to use the module.  The module docstring is also better.

2. **Error Handling:**  Added `try...except` blocks to `get_version`.  This prevents the code from crashing if the `__version__` variable is not defined (which could happen if the version module isn't properly set up).  Added more robust error handling to `is_version_greater_equal` to gracefully handle cases where the input strings aren't valid versions.  This is vital for production code.

3. **`get_version` function:**  Created a `get_version` function to centralize version retrieval.  This is a best practice and allows other parts of the code to easily get the version information without needing to know how it's stored.

4. **`is_version_greater_equal` function:** Added a function to check if a given version is greater than or equal to a required version.  This is a very useful utility that will likely be needed in a larger project.

**How to use the improved code:**

```python
import helicone

# Get the version string
version = helicone.get_version()
if version:
    print(f"Helicone version: {version}")
else:
    print("Helicone version information unavailable.")


# Check if the version is greater than or equal to a required version
required_version = "1.0.0"
is_version_ok = helicone.is_version_greater_equal("1.0.1", required_version)
if is_version_ok:
    print("Version is ok")
else:
    print("Version is not ok")


try:
  is_version_ok = helicone.is_version_greater_equal("1.2.3", "1.2.2")
  print(f"Version check result: {is_version_ok}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during the version check: {e}")

```

This revised code is more robust, maintainable, and provides more useful functionality. It's crucial to add error handling and well-defined functions in any production-level Python code. Remember to replace `"1.0.1"` and `"1.2.3"` with the actual version strings you are checking.  Also remember to ensure the `helicone` module is properly imported into the project.
