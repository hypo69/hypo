# hypotez/src/gui/context_menu/qt6/header.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/gui/context_menu/qt6/header.py`, appears to be a configuration or initialization file.  It defines a global variable `MODE` and includes several multi-line docstrings without specific functionality defined within the file. It also establishes a root path for the project.

## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A global string variable likely used to indicate the application's operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  The value is set to 'dev'.

**Value**: `'dev'`

## Paths

### `__root__`

**Description**:  Calculates and stores the path to the project root directory.  This variable is assigned the path up to the directory containing the 'hypotez' folder.

**Value**: Calculated based on the current working directory.


## Imports

### `sys`, `os`, `pathlib`

**Description**: Imports necessary modules for system interaction, file system operations, and path manipulation.

**Modules**:
- `sys` (for system-specific parameters and functions)
- `os` (for operating system dependent functionality)
- `pathlib` (for object-oriented file system paths)


## Functionality

This file primarily serves as a configuration or initialization file. It sets up paths and potentially global settings needed by other modules in the project.  Further details require additional context from other related files within the project.
