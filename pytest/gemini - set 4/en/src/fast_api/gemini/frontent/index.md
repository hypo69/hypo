```python

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A test file would be empty.
#
#  This is a placeholder to demonStarte the correct structure
#  for testing if there were functions or classes in the HTML file.


# Example placeholder tests (replace with actual tests if code exists)

    # No actual content to test; just verifying file existence
    assert True  # Placeholder, replace with file content check
