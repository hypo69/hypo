# hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/header.py

## Overview

This module, `header.py`, defines constants related to the operating mode and provides utilities for managing file paths within the `hypotez` project.

## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**:  Specifies the operating mode of the application.  Currently set to 'dev'.

**Value**: `'dev'`

## Utilities

### `__root__`

**Description**: Represents the root directory of the `hypotez` project. It's calculated from the current working directory.

**Implementation**:
```python
__root__ : Path = os.getcwd() [:os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez')+7]
```

**Functionality**:
   - Retrieves the current working directory.
   - Finds the index of the substring 'hypotez' in the path.
   - Extracts the path up to and including 'hypotez'.

### `sys.path.append(__root__)`

**Description**: Adds the calculated root directory of the `hypotez` project to the Python import path.

**Implementation**:
```python
sys.path.append (__root__)
```

**Functionality**:
   - Ensures that modules within the `hypotez` project are accessible by Python.

## Modules Used

- `sys`
- `os`
- `pathlib`

##  Important Notes

- The documentation strings within the Python code (`"""Docstrings"""`) are used as a starting point for the documentation generated here.
- The variable `__root__` relies on `hypotez` being a subdirectory of the current working directory.  If `hypotez` is not in the working directory,  `__root__` will be calculated incorrectly.
- The Python code assumes that `hypotez` is a directory in the current working directory and constructs the path to the root folder.  Adjust the code if your project structure is different.


##  Potential Errors

If the `hypotez` directory is not found in the current working directory, the calculation of `__root__` will result in an incorrect path.   Appropriate error handling should be implemented in a production environment.
