**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`TEST_SETTINGS_FILE`:** A constant is used to store the path to the test settings file. This makes the test code more maintainable and avoids hardcoding paths.  Crucially, this allows us to manage the test file for a controlled, reproducible environment.

2. **Error Handling:** The tests now handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` within a `try...except` block to gracefully manage potential issues when the settings file is not found or contains malformed JSON. This is critical for robustness.

3. **File Creation/Deletion:** The tests create a temporary `settings.json` file for each test case, which is essential for running the tests effectively.  Critically, the files are cleaned up with `os.remove()` to avoid accumulating files and problems. This is essential to prevent unexpected outcomes.


4. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** The test names (e.g., `test_version_missing_settings`) more clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The test suite now covers the case of an empty settings file. This ensures the default values are used correctly when the settings file is empty or missing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_version.py
    ```


This improved solution addresses potential errors, provides more thorough coverage, and makes the tests more robust and maintainable. Remember to replace `'../settings.json'` with the correct path if your `settings.json` file is located somewhere else in your project. Always test with various edge case scenarios when you modify production code.
