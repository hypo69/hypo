# hypotez/src/category/_examples/header.py

## Overview

This module provides example functions and classes related to categories, likely within a larger system for managing products and suppliers.  It includes paths to the project's root directory and imports necessary modules for interacting with various components.  Crucially, it seems to be designed to load modules from a custom directory structure.

## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable, likely defining the current operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

**Value**: 'dev'


## Functions (None defined in the provided snippet)


## Classes (None defined in the provided snippet)


## Imports

This section lists the modules imported into this file.

- `sys`
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `json`
- `re`
- `gs` (from `src`)
- `Supplier` (from `src.suppliers`)
- `Product`, `ProductFields`, `ProductFieldsLocators` (from `src.product`)
- `Category` (from `src.category`)
- `j_dumps`, `j_loads`, `pprint`, `save_text_file` (from `src.utils.jjson`)
- `logger` (from `src.logger`)
- `StringFormatter`, `StringNormalizer`, `ProductFieldsValidator` (from `src.utils.string`)


## Global Variables (defined by assignment)


### `dir_root`

**Description**: A `Path` object representing the root directory of the project.

**Initialization**: Determined by finding the path to the `hypotez` directory.

**Use**: Used for accessing and importing modules from within the project's structure.


### `dir_src`

**Description**: A `Path` object representing the 'src' directory within the project.

**Initialization**: Derived from `dir_root`.

**Use**: Used for referencing source code files.


## Modules (implicitly referenced)

- `src`: Appears to be the main project's source code directory.
- `src.category`: A submodule likely containing category-related functions and classes.
- `src.suppliers`: Likely contains modules for managing suppliers.
- `src.product`: Likely contains modules for handling product information.
- `src.utils`: Contains utility functions.
- `src.utils.jjson`: Contains functions for JSON operations.
- `src.logger`: Contains functions for logging.
- `src.utils.string`: Contains functions for string manipulation (likely formatting and validation).

## Notes

The code snippet heavily relies on a custom directory structure and the use of `sys.path.append()`.  This isn't a standard Python practice and should be reviewed for potential issues with module discoverability in different environments. The "..." in some import statements indicate missing parts of the file that need to be considered in a complete documentation.
