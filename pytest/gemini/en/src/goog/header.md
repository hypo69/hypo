```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs.path.root`:** The original code relied on a `gs.path.root` object.  Since that is not provided, you'll need to mock it using `unittest.mock.patch` to create a safe test environment without modifying the actual file system.


2. **Dummy Files:** The tests now create temporary dummy files (`pyproject.toml`) to simulate the presence of marker files, crucial for testing the `set_project_root` function's logic in a controlled way.  Crucially, these files are *removed* after the test to clean up the temporary directory.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, using phrases like "valid input," "no marker files," and "edge case."


4. **Edge Cases:** Tests now explicitly check cases where the marker files are not found, the current directory is the root directory, and a parent directory is the root.


5. **Error Handling:** The test now demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to verify that `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` are raised when appropriate.

6. **Removed Redundant Code:**  Removed unnecessary comments and code not directly tested by the original code.


7. **Robustness:**  Handles the case where the marker files are not found, ensuring that `set_project_root` correctly returns the current directory if no suitable root is located.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Install `pytest`:** If you haven't already, install `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
- **Create a `hypotez/src` directory:**  Place your `settings.json` and `README.MD` files inside it for these tests to run correctly.  Adapt the file paths in the tests to match your actual directory structure.

Remember to adapt the test file paths and the `hypotez/src` directory structure to match your actual setup.

This improved version provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `set_project_root` function.  Further tests can be added to cover various scenarios, especially those related to the file reading (using mocks), as indicated in the comments. Remember that more mocking might be needed depending on how the `gs` module is defined.
