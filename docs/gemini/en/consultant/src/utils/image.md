.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

## Changes Made

- Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to all functions, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples.
- Replaced the usage of `pprint` with `logger.info` and  `logger.debug` for more appropriate logging levels.
- Implemented more robust error handling, using `logger.error` and `logger.critical` for specific error types (e.g., download failure, file creation errors).
- Removed unnecessary comments and improved code clarity.
- Improved code structure for better readability.
- Ensured proper handling of potential exceptions.
- Added `return None` statements in appropriate `except` blocks for clearer error handling.
- Fixed the redundancy with `return` inside `try-except` block in `save_png` by moving it outside the block.
- Added explicit `raise Exception` where needed to clarify the expected behavior when errors occur.
- Converted `Path` instances to strings before returning in `save_png`.
