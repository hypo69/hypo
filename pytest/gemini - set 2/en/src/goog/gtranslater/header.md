```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures for more controlled testing of loading settings and the README. This isolates the `set_project_root` function from external file dependencies.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases now cover more scenarios:
   - Valid input (file exists)
   - `pyproject.toml` in a parent directory.
   - No marker file.
   - File in subdirectory.
   - Multiple marker files.
   - Invalid marker file type.
   - `settings.json` file not found.
   - `settings.json` invalid JSON.
   - `README.MD` file not found.
   - `README.MD` invalid content

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, catching exceptions from file handling.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive and indicative of the test conditions.

5. **Mocking:** Added a `patch` to mock `sys.path` for the `test_set_project_root_sys_path_insertion` to verify that the insertion happens.

6. **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the main file's `settings` and `doc_str` loading.  The tests now also verify these errors.

7. **`tmp_path`:** Critically important to use `tmp_path` fixture for creating temporary directories. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other.

This significantly improved test suite covers a wider range of possible situations and is more robust. Remember to install `pytest` and `packaging`:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
Run the tests using `pytest`.


This improved version addresses the issues and provides a comprehensive testing Startegy for the Python code. Remember to adapt the test scenarios based on the specific expected behavior of your code. Remember to install the required package:


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
