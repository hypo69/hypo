**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now heavily utilize `unittest.mock.patch` to mock various parts of the code, particularly the `Driver`'s methods and the asynchronous functions.  This isolates the tests from external dependencies and prevents errors related to external resources (e.g., web driver interactions).


2. **Asynchronous Handling:**  Crucially, the tests correctly handle asynchronous operations by using `asyncio.new_event_loop()` and `loop.run_until_complete()`. This ensures that the `grab_page` function, which is asynchronous, runs correctly within the testing context.


3. **Error Handling:** The `test_grab_page_execute_locator_exception` test now properly uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected `ExecuteLocatorException` and verifies that the exception is caught and handled appropriately (or not, depending on the expected behavior).


4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** While it was difficult to fully verify all internal functions (like `id_product`), this test now covers a significant portion of the `graber.grab_page` logic, including valid inputs, exceptions, and the crucial asynchronous aspects.

5. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more focused on the expected outcomes (e.g., `isinstance(result, ProductFields)`), providing a more direct way to validate results.


6. **Edge Case (Missing Data):** The `test_grab_page_invalid_input` test covers the critical case where the necessary data is not provided (e.g. if `id_product` was missing).


**Before Running:**

- **Install pytest:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **Replace Placeholders:** The code still relies on placeholder `ProductFields` definition and other potentially missing imports. If these are part of the larger test suite, ensure the imports are included.

- **Adjust `driver_mock`:** If there are specific methods required to operate `driver_mock` (e.g., `get`, `post`), they should be included within this fixture or the `test_grab_page_...` tests.


This improved test suite provides a more robust and reliable way to validate the `graber.grab_page` function, dealing with asynchronous calls and various exception cases. Remember to adapt the assertions and mocks according to the specific return values and functionalities within your `gearbest` library. Remember to also uncomment imports if necessary.
