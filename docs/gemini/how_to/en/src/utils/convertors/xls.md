## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/utils/convertors/xls.py`

This module provides functions for reading and saving Excel files (`.xls` format).  It's part of the `hypotez` project's utility functions for converting data formats.


**Functions:**

* **`xls2dict(xls_file: str | Path) -> dict | None`**: This function reads an Excel file and converts its data into a Python dictionary.


**How to Use:**

1. **Import the module:**

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.utils.convertors.xls import xls2dict
   ```

2. **Provide the Excel file path:**

   You can pass either a string representing the file path or a `pathlib.Path` object.

   ```python
   xls_file_path = "path/to/your/file.xls"  # or Path("path/to/your/file.xls")
   ```

3. **Call the `xls2dict` function:**

   ```python
   data_dict = xls2dict(xls_file_path)
   ```

4. **Handle potential errors:**

   The function returns a dictionary if the file is successfully read. However, it might return `None` if there's an error (e.g., file not found, invalid file format).


   ```python
   if data_dict is not None:
       print(data_dict)
   else:
       print("Error reading the Excel file.")
   ```

**Example:**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.convertors.xls import xls2dict
from pathlib import Path

try:
    file_path = Path("data.xls")  # Replace with the actual file
    data = xls2dict(file_path)
    if data:
        print(data)
    else:
        print("Error: File not found or not readable.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Dependencies:**

This function depends on the `src.utils.xls` module, which likely contains the internal implementation for reading Excel files.  You'll need that module properly installed and imported.  Ensure you have any necessary external libraries required by `src.utils.xls` (e.g., `openpyxl` or similar) installed.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The example code includes a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential errors like the file not being found or a format issue. Always include robust error handling in production code.
* **File Format:**  This code assumes the input file is an Excel `.xls` file.  If your file is in a different format (e.g., `.xlsx`), you'll need a different function or library (like `openpyxl`) for handling the different format.


This detailed usage guide provides a clear and complete explanation for working with the `xls2dict` function. Remember to replace placeholders like `"path/to/your/file.xls"` with your actual file path. Remember to install any necessary packages for your Excel handling tools (like `openpyxl`).
