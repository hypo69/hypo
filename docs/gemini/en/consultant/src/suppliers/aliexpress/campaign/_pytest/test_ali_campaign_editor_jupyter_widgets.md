```

**Changes Made**

*   Added missing imports (`from src.logger import logger`, `import header`).
*   Replaced standard `try-except` blocks with error handling using `logger.error`.
*   Added detailed explanations for each code block using `#`.
*   Converted comments to RST format.
*   Improved docstrings following Sphinx-style guidelines.
*   Removed redundant docstring sections in the test functions.
*   Added :raises Exception: to docstrings to indicate potential exceptions.
*   Added example usage in docstrings.
