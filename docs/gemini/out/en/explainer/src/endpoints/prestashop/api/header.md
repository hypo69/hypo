## <algorithm>

The code aims to locate the project root directory and load project settings and documentation.

1. **`set_project_root()`:**
   - Takes a tuple of marker file names (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) as input.
   - Starts at the current file's directory.
   - Iterates up the directory tree, checking if any of the marker files exist in each parent directory.
   - If a marker file is found, it returns the path of the parent directory.
   - Otherwise, it returns the path of the current directory.
   - Example: If the current file is in `/home/user/project/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/header.py`, and `pyproject.toml` exists in `/home/user/project`, the function will return `/home/user/project`.


2. **Project Root Determination:**
   - Calls `set_project_root()` to get the project root.
   - Example: The call to `set_project_root()` with default arguments will locate `/home/user/project` if it exists and contains `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`


3. **Settings Loading:**
   - Attempts to open `settings.json` in the `src` directory of the project root.
   - Loads the JSON data into the `settings` variable.
   - Example: If `settings.json` contains `{"project_name": "MyProject", "version": "1.0"}`, then `settings` will hold the loaded data.


4. **Documentation Loading:**
   - Attempts to open `README.MD` in the `src` directory of the project root.
   - Reads the content into the `doc_str` variable.
   - Example: If `README.MD` contains the text "This is my project's documentation.", then `doc_str` will hold the entire string.

5. **Project Information Retrieval:**
   - Extracts various project details (name, version, author, etc.) from the `settings` dictionary.
   - Uses `get()` to handle cases where a key might not exist, defaults to provided values.
   - Example: `__project_name__` will hold "MyProject" if found in `settings.json`, otherwise defaults to "hypotez".

Dependencies:

- `sys`: For interacting with the Python runtime environment.
- `json`: For handling JSON data.
- `packaging.version`: For handling software versioning.
- `pathlib`: For handling file paths in a more object-oriented manner.
- `src`: This imports a module/package named `gs` which is likely responsible for providing path manipulation and project-wide utilities.

## <explanation>

### Imports

- `sys`: Used to add the project root to `sys.path` to allow importing modules from other parts of the project.
- `json`: Used for reading and parsing the `settings.json` file.
- `packaging.version`: Used for handling software versions.
- `pathlib`: For working with file paths in a more object-oriented way.  This is a good practice for handling paths consistently and safely.
- `src`: This is a relative import. It's likely that `gs` is a module or package within the `src` package.  It implies a structure like `src/gs/path.py` for example.  The `gs.path.root` part suggests that the `src` package likely provides utilities for finding the project root or working with paths within the project.

### Classes

There are no classes defined in this code.

### Functions

- `set_project_root()`:
    - Arguments: `marker_files` (a tuple of strings). Default is `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.
    - Return value: `Path` object representing the project root.
    - Functionality: Recursively searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing any of the specified marker files.  If not found, returns the directory containing the current file. This is important for locating the project's base directory for correct imports and path management within the project.

### Variables

- `MODE`: A string constant with the value 'dev'.
- `__root__`: A `Path` object representing the root directory of the project.
- `settings`: A dictionary holding project configuration. Loaded from `settings.json`.
- `doc_str`: A string containing the project's documentation (from `README.MD`).
- `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`: Project-specific attributes extracted from the `settings` dictionary.  These variables give the application metadata like the name, version, documentation, and even optional details or links for supporting the project.

### Potential Errors/Improvements

- **Error Handling:** The code uses `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` if `settings.json` or `README.MD` are not found or are improperly formatted.  This is crucial for robustness in applications, handling unexpected situations.
- **`gs` Dependency:** The code relies on the `gs` package's `path.root` attribute. It's important to ensure that `gs` is correctly installed and available in the Python path. The `gs` dependency could be a component for path management and other utility functions within the project.
- **`MODE` variable:** The `MODE` variable is defined but not used. Potentially this is for different deployment or development environments, but more information would be helpful.


### Relationships with other parts of the project

This code initializes project-wide configuration and context. It's a fundamental step that other modules or endpoints within the `prestashop` API, or even the whole project, depend on to operate using the project's name, version, settings, and/or documentation.
