# Changes Made

*   All commands are now stored as Python variables (e.g., `COMMAND_HI`).
*   Added a module docstring using reStructuredText (RST).
*   Added comments explaining each command's purpose.
*   Comments are now formatted in RST, following Sphinx-style conventions.
*   Concisely named variables (`COMMAND_HI`, etc.) improve code readability.
*   All code blocks are properly commented with `#` and explanation.
