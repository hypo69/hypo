**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_value`).

2. **Specific Assertions:**  Instead of just checking the type, the `test_version_value` test now checks that the version string has the expected number of parts (e.g., major.minor.patch) and that each part is a digit.  This is crucial for validating the version format.  Adapt the assertion to your actual version format.

3. **Edge Cases (invalid format):** The `test_invalid_version_format` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions when the version string is in an incorrect format (crucial for robust testing).

4. **Empty String Check:** The `test_version_not_empty` test ensures the version string isn't an empty string, preventing a possible crash or unexpected behavior.

5. **Type Checking (important):** The `test_version_not_int` test checks if the version is not an integer.

6. **Example of a fixture (commented out):** The commented-out `test_version_with_fixture` example demonstrates how to use a fixture if necessary.  However, for simple verification of a single variable, a fixture is likely unnecessary.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as your `version.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`

**Important Considerations:**

* **Version Format:** Adapt the assertions in `test_version_value` and the `test_invalid_version_format` test to the specific format expected for the version string.
* **Additional Tests:** Consider adding more tests to cover other potential scenarios, such as checking the version format when the code is in a different environment or handling more complex invalid inputs.
* **Error Handling:** If your code has more sophisticated logic for validating the version, adjust the tests to thoroughly check those validation processes.


This revised solution provides more comprehensive and effective tests, covering a wider range of potential issues and edge cases. Remember to tailor the tests to the actual function(s) and their expected behavior in your `version.py` file. Remember to uncomment and adjust the example of testing a fixture if needed.
