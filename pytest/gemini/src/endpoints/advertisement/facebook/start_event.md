**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Crucial for testing functions that interact with external resources (like the webdriver, file system, or network).  The `mock_driver` and `mock_logger` fixtures mock those dependencies.
* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests cover valid input, empty lists, potential exceptions, and the `no_video` option.  A test for an invalid filename is added.
* **Clear Test Names:** Names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.
* **Specific Assertions:**  Instead of just checking if `run_events` completes without errors, now checks if the logger was called (crucial since the original code heavily relies on it.)
* **Error Handling:**  The `test_facebook_promoter_run_events_exception` test now demonstrates handling of an expected exception.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`j_loads` and File Handling:**  The provided code loads JSON files. You'll need to mock the `j_loads` function or create dummy JSON files for testing.  The `test_facebook_promoter_run_events_invalid_filename` test demonstrates this approach.  You should create test JSON files for different scenarios.
* **Time-Dependent Logic (`time.sleep`, `while True`):**  Testing time-dependent loops and delays (like `time.sleep(7200)`) is challenging.   In this case, mocking `time.time()` or `time.sleep()` could help.  It may be more appropriate to test the internal logic of the loop and its actions instead of the delay directly.
* **Integration Tests:** These tests focus on the `FacebookPromoter` class itself;  you might consider integration tests to verify that the FacebookPromoter interacts correctly with the driver and other components, if needed.
* **Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary imports (e.g., `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`, etc.) are included in your test file.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_start_event.py`).
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_start_event.py`


Remember to replace placeholder comments (`# Replace with actual implementation if needed`) with the actual code from the dependencies if you have them.  The way you handle file loading and possible `j_loads` errors in the `FacebookPromoter` code will be key to creating complete and robust tests. Remember the JSON file handling.
