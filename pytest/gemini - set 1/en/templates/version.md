**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The original code lacked robust error handling. The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, preventing crashes and returning sensible defaults.
2. **Temporary Files:** The tests now use temporary files (`settings.json`) for each test, preventing conflicts between tests and ensuring a clean environment for every test run.  Crucially, the `test_cleanup` function is added to remove these temporary files, cleaning up the test environment *after* the test run.
3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
4. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests cover valid JSON, an empty file, a non-existent file, and invalid JSON, validating robust error handling.
5. **Assertions:** Assertions are used to verify the expected values of the variables (__project_name__, __version__, etc.).
6. **pytest:** The tests are using pytest effectively, demonStarting how to use `pytest.raises` (although in this case, `assert` is more appropriate).
7. **Import:** The necessary import statements are included at the beginning.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`

This improved test suite provides a much more reliable and comprehensive way to ensure the correctness of the `version.py` code. Remember to put the `version.py` file in the `hypotez/src/templates/` directory in the same folder structure as the test file.
