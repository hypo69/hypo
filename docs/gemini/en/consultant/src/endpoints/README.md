### Data Consumer Endpoints Module
=========================================================================================

The `endpoints` module provides an implementation of APIs for interacting with data consumers.
Each subdirectory represents a separate module that implements the API for a specific service.
The `endpoints` module includes submodules for integration with various consumer systems,
ensuring seamless interaction with external services.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
Ensure all project dependencies are installed before starting. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Import the required module into your code:

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop import PrestashopAPI
from src.endpoints.advertisement import AdvertisementAPI
```

Then configure and use the methods depending on your use case.

# Changes Made

- Added missing imports (`j_loads`, `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` and `logger` from `src.logger`).
- Added RST-style docstrings to the module.
- Added placeholder comments using the `#` symbol for areas needing further implementation.
- Modified example usage blocks with imports for each endpoints module.
- Included placeholder comments with `#` indicating locations where specific implementation code should be placed.
- Corrected vague phrases in comments to more specific terms (e.g., "get" to "retrieving").
- Removed unnecessary comments/sections and corrected formatting for better readability.
