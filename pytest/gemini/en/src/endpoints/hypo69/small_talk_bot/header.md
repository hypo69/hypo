**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Crucially, fixtures are now used to create and manage temporary files for testing.  This is essential for isolating tests and avoiding side effects.
* **`tmp_path`:**  The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories and files, ensuring clean test environments.  This is a *much* better solution than manually creating and deleting files.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests now cover a wider range of scenarios, including the case where the marker file is in a parent directory, no marker files are found, and the case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`.
* **Error Handling:** Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are added to demonstrate proper handling of potential exceptions during file reading.  This is a critical improvement.
* **Mocking `gs`:** A `@patch` decorator is used to mock the `gs` module to simulate the existence of `gs.path.root`.
* **Mocking `settings.json`:** The `mock_settings_file_path` fixture now creates a temporary `settings.json` file for testing settings loading.
* **Mocking `README.MD`:** The `mock_README_file_path` fixture handles mocking `README.MD` in a similar way.
* **Global Variable Test:** A test specifically checks the assignment of `__root__` to ensure the global variable is correctly set.
* **Clearer Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each test more explicitly.


This revised solution is significantly more robust and comprehensive, addressing potential issues and improving the quality of the test suite. Remember to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install packaging
```

Remember to adapt the code to replace `gs` with the actual module or object handling file paths.  This improved example is a much more realistic and functional solution. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`).
