# hypotez/src/utils/video.py

## Overview

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.  It includes error handling and logging for robust operation.


## Functions

### `save_video_from_url`

**Description**: Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

**Parameters**:
- `url` (str): The URL from which to download the video.
- `save_path` (str): The path to save the downloaded video.

**Returns**:
- `Optional[Path]`: The path to the saved file, or `None` if the operation failed.  Returns `None` on errors and if the file is 0 bytes.

**Raises**:
- `aiohttp.ClientError`: on network issues during the download.


### `get_video_data`

**Description**: Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Handles file not found and read errors.

**Parameters**:
- `file_name` (str): The path to the video file to read.

**Returns**:
- `Optional[bytes]`: The binary data of the file if it exists, or `None` if the file is not found or an error occurred.


## Usage Examples


```python
import asyncio
# Example usage for save_video_from_url
url = "https://example.com/video.mp4" # Replace with a valid URL
save_path = "local_video.mp4"
result = asyncio.run(save_video_from_url(url, save_path))
if result:
    print(f"Video saved to {result}")
else:
    print("Video download or save failed.")

# Example usage for get_video_data
data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
if data:
    print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
else:
    print("Video data retrieval failed.")
```

**Important Notes**:

- Replace `"https://example.com/video.mp4"` with a valid video URL for actual use.
- Ensure the necessary dependencies (`aiohttp`, `aiofiles`, `pathlib`) are installed.
- The `main()` function is included for demonstration purposes.  It is not recommended to run it directly in a production environment unless it is intended to be executed as part of a larger application.
