**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Added `example_settings_json` and `mock_settings_file` fixtures to create mock settings.json files within temporary directories, which are crucial for testing the file loading logic in an isolated way. This addresses a significant weakness in the previous solution.

2. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now cover various scenarios:
   - Valid input (file exists).
   - File not found (handles exceptions).
   - Invalid JSON (handles exceptions).
   - Cases where marker files are in different locations.


3. **`pytest.raises`:**  While the previous version used assertions that assumed the function would fail, these tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` using `pytest.raises`. This is a much better approach for testing error handling.


4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and explicitly state the input conditions being tested.

5. **Correct use of fixture for testing with mock files:** The `mock_settings_file` fixture now correctly creates the necessary directory structure before writing the `settings.json` file, ensuring the file path is valid for the test.  The `set_project_root` function is now being tested by using `mock_settings_file`

6. **Temporary Directories:** Uses `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary directories for the mock files. This prevents interference between tests and keeps the tests isolated.

7. **`assert` Statements:** The `assert` statements are more meaningful, directly verifying the expected results.


This revised solution significantly improves the test coverage, using fixtures effectively and addressing important edge cases and exception handling. Remember to install the necessary libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
