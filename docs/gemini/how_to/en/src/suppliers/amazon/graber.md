.. module: src.suppliers.amazon
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis:  Class to collect field values from the `amazon.com` product page.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    If non-standard processing is needed, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions
    using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, you
    must pass a value to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own
    decorator, uncomment the decorator lines and redefine its behavior.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block around the `grab_page` function. This is crucial for robustness. If any error occurs during data extraction, the function now returns `None` to signal the failure. The error is also logged using `logger.error()`.  This also prevents crashes if individual functions fail.

2. **`_fetch_all_data` function:** Created a helper function.  This makes the `grab_page` function cleaner and easier to maintain.  It takes `product_id` and passes it into the field-fetching functions.

3. **`product_id` parameter:** Added `product_id` to the `grab_page` function to allow passing of the product ID to the data extraction functions. This is *essential* for making the code functional. The `product_id` is now correctly used in `_fetch_all_data`.  Crucially, the individual `self.id_product` now expects this parameter.

4. **`ProductFields` Initialization:** Inside `grab_page`,  `self.fields` is now correctly initialized as an empty `ProductFields` object before attempting to populate it.


5. **Clearer Function Signature:** The `_fetch_all_data` function signature is simplified.

**How to use:**

```python
# Example usage (assuming you have a driver instance 'driver')
async def main():
    graber = Graber(driver)
    product_id_to_fetch = "your_product_id"
    result = await graber.grab_page(driver, product_id_to_fetch)

    if result:
        print(result.name)  # Access the product name field.
        # ... Access other fields as needed
    else:
        print("Error fetching product data.")


asyncio.run(main())

```

**Important:** You *must* implement the `id_product` and other field fetching functions (`self.name`, `self.description`, etc.) within the `Graber` class to actually fetch the data.  These functions should populate the `self.fields` object correctly with the extracted data.  The example above only shows the *structure* for doing that.


This revised solution addresses the critical issues of error handling, parameter passing, and initialization, making the code much more robust and functional. Remember to replace `"your_product_id"` with the actual product ID you want to fetch. Remember to replace placeholders for the functions with actual data fetching logic based on your Amazon product page structure.
