**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **WebDriver Fixture:** The code now includes a `driver` fixture to manage the WebDriver instance.  This is vital for any Selenium test.  The `driver.quit()` is critical to avoid resource leaks.

2. **Page Loading:** The `driver.get("about:blank")` line is essential.  JavaScript code operates within a webpage context;  you must load a page first!  Replace `about:blank` with the appropriate starting page for your tests.

3. **Robust Border Check:** The test now correctly uses `driver.execute_script` to retrieve the current border style, and uses an assertion to ensure the border is set correctly.

4. **Error Handling:** The `test_borderify_no_body_element` test now demonstrates how to handle a situation where the script might fail silently. This is key, as real-world code isn't always perfect.

5. **`test_borderify_invalid_border_style`:** This tests an *invalid* border style.  Real code needs to handle such cases gracefully.

6. **`test_borderify_alert`:** Added a test for the `alert()`.  This correctly switches to the alert, accepts it (very important!), and checks for proper execution without raising an exception.

7. **Error Context:**  The `except` blocks now provide more context about any errors, making debugging much easier.


**Before Running:**

- **Install necessary libraries:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
  ```
- **Install Edge WebDriver:** Download the appropriate WebDriver for your Edge browser version and add its path to your system's `PATH` environment variable or use a `webdriver-manager` to download it automatically.

- **Replace Placeholders:** Update `driver.get("about:blank")` with the URL of the page your JavaScript code will run on.

Now you can run the tests with:

```bash
pytest test_borderify.py
```


This revised solution provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests, covering various scenarios and potential issues. Remember to adapt the tests to your specific needs and the structure of your application. Remember that the tests are testing the script that is running on the browser. The JavaScript code `document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";` will actually work only on an HTML page.
