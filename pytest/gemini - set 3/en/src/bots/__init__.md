**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **No Code, No Tests:** The original prompt had no code in the `input_code` section.  This solution provides *example* test cases.  You MUST replace these example tests with tests tailored to the actual functions and methods within the `hypotez/src/bots/__init__.py` file.

2. **Example Scenarios:** The example tests demonStarte various test categories: instantiation, checking a class variable (`MODE`), testing for expected exceptions, and example testing a method.

3. **Clear Test Function Names:**  The test function names are descriptive, indicating the purpose of each test.

4. **Isolation and Independence:** Each test function is isolated, and the example uses `pytest.raises` to test for the expected exceptions.

5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Cases:** Added a test for invalid or unexpected mode. You'll need to add tests that cover all the possible scenarios defined by the methods and classes in your `hypotez/src/bots/__init__.py` file.

6. **Exception Handling with `pytest.raises`:** The code correctly demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs.

7. **Dummy Assertions:**  I've added `assert bot.send_message("Test message") == True` for illuStartion.  **You need to replace this with accurate assertions based on the actual return values from your functions.**

8. **Crucial Fixture Placeholder:**  While I included examples of functions, if your code has dependencies, fixtures will be crucial. For example, if the `TelegramBot` class depends on a database connection or some other resource, you would need a fixture to provide this resource to the tests.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_bots.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_bots.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:** The provided example test cases are templates. You need to modify them according to the structure of the functions in `hypotez/src/bots/__init__.py`.  This includes the types of expected inputs, outputs, and potential errors.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Create a comprehensive suite of tests to cover all possible scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and edge cases.
*   **Mock Dependencies:** If your `TelegramBot` code interacts with external services (like a database or an API), you'll likely need to mock those dependencies for effective testing.  Using libraries like `unittest.mock` is essential.
*   **Specific Error Handling:** If your code raises specific exception types (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`), ensure your tests check for those using `pytest.raises`.


By implementing these suggestions, you'll create robust and comprehensive test cases for your `TelegramBot` code. Remember to replace the example content with the actual code and add appropriate assertions.
