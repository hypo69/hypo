**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_version_valid`, `test_version_name`).

2. **Type Assertions:** Added `isinstance()` checks to ensure variables have the correct data type (string in this case).

3. **Specific Assertions:** More specific assertions are added to validate the content of the `__version__`, `__name__`, and `__details__` variables. For example, the `__version__` test now checks if the string matches the expected version.

4. **Testing `MODE`:** Added a test case (`test_mode_valid`) to verify the `MODE` constant's value and data type.

5. **Exception Handling (Example):** The `test_no_unexpected_exceptions` example demonstrates how to check for unexpected exceptions if there were functions or methods that might raise errors.  In this case, it's commented out since the provided code does not contain any function calls.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Missing Functions/Methods:** The original Python code has no functions or methods, making tests relatively simple.  If there were functions or methods requiring input and output, more elaborate test cases would be needed.
- **Edge Cases (Limited):**  Edge cases are harder to determine in the given example, because the code doesn't perform any computations or interact with external resources.  We tested the most basic data type verification.
- **Fixture Considerations (If Applicable):** The provided code lacks functions that would benefit from fixtures, so fixtures are not used in these tests.


This improved solution provides more comprehensive and focused test cases for the given Python code. Remember to adapt these tests if the structure of the code changes. Remember to adapt these tests if the structure of the code changes. Add tests for functions/methods, validate parameters, test error handling, and cover different scenarios for more robust testing.  Replace the commented-out assertions with the appropriate assertions for the data contained within `__name__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` according to the actual content.
