**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Test Cases:** The tests now target specific attributes (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `MODE`) instead of just generic assertions.  This is crucial for targeted testing.

2. **Type Checking:**  Added checks to ensure the variables are of the correct data types (e.g., `Version` for `__version__`, `str` for `__doc__`).

3. **Valid Format Checks:** The `test_version_valid_format` test now attempts to create a `Version` object from `__version__`. If it fails, the test will catch the exception and report it. This is better than just assuming the format is correct.

4. **Empty String Check:** The `test_docstring_not_empty` test verifies that `__doc__` isn't an empty string, which is a common requirement for documentation.

5. **Dictionary Check:**  The `test_details_type` test explicitly checks if `__details__` is a dictionary. This is essential since `__details__` may be a complex object.


6. **Mode Test:** Checks for `MODE`'s correct data type and value. Replace `['dev', 'prod']` with actual possible values if needed.

7. **Edge Case Example (Important):**  The `test_version_edge_case` example illuStartes how to design tests for specific scenarios that might not be fully covered by the normal test cases (e.g., handling of versions earlier than a specific release).  You'll need to replace the example with the actual edge cases or validation logic in your code.


8. **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions, a crucial part of robust testing.  The example `test_no_attribute` demonStartes how to handle cases where you expect attributes or values to not exist (or raise exceptions).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger_examples.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_logger_examples.py` from your terminal in the directory where the file is located.


**Crucial Next Step:**

**Analyze `__details__`:**  The code snippet you provided doesn't show how `__details__` is populated.  You *must* modify the tests if the `__details__` object has specific expected values or structure.  The current `test_details_type` test is a very basic one; you'll need to add tests based on the actual implementation of this object.   The same is true for other possible scenarios and specific validation steps.
