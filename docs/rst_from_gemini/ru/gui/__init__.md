""" Module: hypotez/src/gui

This module is the initial entry point for the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
portion of the Hypotez project.  It likely contains imports and/or
setup for the various GUI components.
"""
""" @namespace src.gui """

"""
  This section should document any specific roles or responsibilities of the gui module.
  For example:
  - Contains the main application window.
  - Manages user interactions and displays.
  - Initializes the GUI elements and their dependencies.
  - Provides a high-level interface for other modules in the project to interact with the user.

  A more detailed explanation of the functions and classes contained within this module
  is highly encouraged to provide greater context to the reader.

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__   

from .openai_trаigner import AssistantMainWindow


# Add any necessary docstrings for imported classes or functions.  For example:
#
# def initialize_gui():
#   """Initializes the main GUI window and its components."""
#   # ... implementation details ...
```

**Explanation of Improvements and Best Practices:**

* **Clearer Module Description:** The docstring now clearly states that this is the GUI entry point, providing a high-level overview of its purpose.  Crucially, it explains *what* the module does, not just *where* it's located.

* **`@namespace` usage:** While `@namespace` is a comment convention and not a direct Python construct, the comment still clarifies the module's role in the project.

* **Detailed Docstring:** The docstring is expanded to give a more comprehensive understanding of the module's role. It also includes a placeholder for important information about the functions within the module (e.g., initializing the GUI window).  This is _essential_ for maintainability.

* **Placeholder for Internal Details:** The comment section clearly identifies where more detail about the module's functionality should go.  This helps create a well-organized and documented project.

* **Example Import Docstring:** Added an example of how to document functions imported from submodules.


**How to Further Improve:**

* **Specific Functionality:** Detail the functions and classes within `openai_trаigner` that are exposed through `AssistantMainWindow`.  For example, if the `AssistantMainWindow` allows users to provide prompts and get responses, document that.

* **Dependencies:**  Mention any critical dependencies (`pip install ...`) that the GUI module has.

* **Error Handling:** Briefly document error handling mechanisms, if any.

* **External Interactions:** Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the Hypotez project (e.g., data storage, API calls).

* **Example Usage (Optional):**  If possible, provide a concise example of how to use `AssistantMainWindow` to illustrate its functionality.


By adding these details, the documentation will become more useful and help others understand and maintain the codebase.  Remember to update the documentation as the code evolves.  A good practice is to keep the docstrings up to date during development.
