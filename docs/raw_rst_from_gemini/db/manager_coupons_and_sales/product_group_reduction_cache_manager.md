```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Crucially, added `try...except` blocks around all database operations.  This prevents the script from crashing if a database error occurs.  The `self.session.rollback()` is critical: if an error happens after adding a record but before commit, rolling back prevents an incomplete or invalid state in the database.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  Improved error messages to include the exception details.
* **Explicit `ForeignKey`:** Added `nullable=False` to `id_product` and `id_group` in the model definition.  Foreign keys should typically not be nullable in production code.
* **`scoped_session`:**  Using `scoped_session` is generally better practice for SQLAlchemy session management than `sessionmaker` when using context managers because `scoped_session` automatically manages the opening and closing of the session.
* **Context Manager:** The `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are now properly implemented to ensure the session is closed and removed when the manager is no longer needed.
* **Credentials Validation:** Added a check to ensure that the provided credentials dictionary is valid, containing all necessary keys.
* **Directly using credentials dictionary:** Improved the `connection_string` formatting to avoid nested dictionary access. This makes the code more readable and less error-prone.

**How to use it:**

1.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (SQLAlchemy, mysql-connector-python).
2.  **Critical:** Define your `gs` object and how it will return the database credentials correctly.
3.  Instantiate the manager, passing in the credentials:

```python
credentials = gs.get_db_credentials('db_translations')  # Adapt this based on your gs object
manager = ProductGroupReductionCacheManager(credentials)
```

4.  Use the methods (e.g., `manager.insert_record`, `manager.select_record`, etc.) as before.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Database Connection Pooling:**  If you're dealing with a lot of database operations in your application, consider using database connection pooling to improve performance.
*   **Transaction Management:** For more complex operations, consider using explicit transactions.
*   **Logging:**   Use a robust logging library like `logging` or an advanced logging solution to log errors with context (date, time, request details, etc.) for better debugging.
*   **Security:**  Never hardcode database credentials directly into your code.  Use environment variables or a configuration file to manage them securely.

This revised code is significantly more robust and suitable for production use.  Remember to always handle potential errors in database interactions.
