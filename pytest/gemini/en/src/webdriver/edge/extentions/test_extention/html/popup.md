**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is a web page, not Python code.  Therefore, there's no Python code to test.  The example tests above are placeholders.

To write meaningful tests, you need to provide the Python code that interacts with the HTML file.  That code (likely using libraries like Selenium or similar WebDriver tools) would be the target of your tests.

**Example of What a Real Test Might Look Like (if Python code existed):**

```python
# Example (hypothetical) Python code interacting with the HTML
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

def click_extension_icon():
    # ... code to find and click the extension icon ...
    pass

def check_popup_exists():
    # ... code to check if the popup (html) is displayed ...
    pass


def test_extension_icon_clicks():
  """Test the extension icon click, if implemented"""
  driver = webdriver.Edge()  # Initialize Edge driver
  try:
      click_extension_icon()
      assert check_popup_exists()
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
  finally:
      driver.quit()
```

In this example:

* `test_extension_icon_clicks` is a test function.
* `click_extension_icon` and `check_popup_exists` are functions (placeholders) that you would need to write to interact with the web page.
* `pytest.raises` would be used if the Python code under test *could* raise an exception, like invalid input.
* Selenium would handle finding elements within the web page (`popup.html`).

**Crucially, you must provide the Python code that interacts with the HTML for meaningful tests to be written.**  The provided HTML itself isn't testable in Python without additional context. Remember that tests should verify that the *Python code* functions correctly and reliably in relation to the HTML, not just the HTML itself.
