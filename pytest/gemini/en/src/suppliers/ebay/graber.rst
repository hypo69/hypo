**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` class and its methods. This is crucial for isolating the `Graber` class's behavior from external dependencies.  Critically, it mocks the `fetch_data` function. This is essential, as this was not part of the `Graber` class and would've failed without.
* **MockProductFields:**  A `MockProductFields` class is created to simulate the `ProductFields` class's behavior.  This ensures that tests don't rely on the full implementation of `ProductFields` which might not be fully developed.
* **`test_grab_page_valid_input`:**  Now mocks the individual functions (e.g., `id_product`, etc.) that are called in `grab_page`. This is vital for testing the internal flow. The `fetch_all_data` function is also mocked, so tests don't depend on other external functions.
* **`test_grab_page_with_no_data`:** A new test covers the case where the functions do *not* return data. This is critical for robustness.
* **`test_grab_page_locator_exception`:** A test for the `ExecuteLocatorException` is included. This handles a situation where there is a potential issue with the locator and ensures the `Graber` function handles exceptions correctly.
* **Asynchronous Tests (`@pytest.mark.asyncio`)**: Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to correctly handle asynchronous functions.
* **Error Handling:** The tests appropriately use `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions.
* **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test function names are more explicit about the test scenario.


**Before running the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Ensure that any necessary dependencies (e.g., `pydantic`) are installed.**  This is not directly tested, but you will have to install those as well!


This improved test suite provides a much more comprehensive and reliable way to test the `Graber` class. Remember to adapt the assertions and mocking to match the actual implementation of `ProductFields` and the functions within `Graber` if they are different.
