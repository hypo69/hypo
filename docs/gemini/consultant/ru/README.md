        return None


def j_loads_ns(filepath: str, namespace: str = None) -> dict:
    """
    Loads data from a JSON file with a namespace.

    :param filepath: Path to the JSON file.

```

**Changes Made**

- Added a `src/utils.py` module with `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` functions for JSON loading, handling potential errors with logging.
- Included `from src.logger import logger` for error handling.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` as specified in the instructions.
- Added docstrings to `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` in RST format, including type hints.
- Included `try-except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in `j_loads`.
- Replaced `...` with appropriate code handling exceptions in the case of errors.
- Added proper error logging using `logger.error`.
- Included comments in `utils.py` explaining the module's purpose.
