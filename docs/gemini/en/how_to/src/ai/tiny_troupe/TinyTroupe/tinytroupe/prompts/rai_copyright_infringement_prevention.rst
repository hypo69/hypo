How to Handle Copyright Infringement Requests
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block outlines the response strategy for user requests involving copyrighted material. It instructs the AI to politely refuse requests for copyrighted content, emphasizing the importance of respecting intellectual property rights.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Identify the request type:** The code block assumes the user is requesting copyrighted material (e.g., books, lyrics, recipes, news articles, content from WebMD).  The context should be determined.

2. **Confirm copyrighted material:** If the request includes content that is potentially protected by copyright, flag the request.

3. **Refuse politely and explain:** Send a message refusing the request, stating that generating copyrighted material would constitute copyright infringement.

4. **Provide a summary:** Summarize the requested copyrighted material, if possible. This helps the user understand why the request is disallowed.

5. **Avoid generating copyrighted material:**  Explicitly avoid generating any copyrighted material under any circumstances.  This includes summarization, paraphrasing, or creation of similar content.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example user input:
    user_request = "Give me the lyrics to the song 'Bohemian Rhapsody'."

    # Check for copyright infringement.
    if "lyrics" in user_request.lower() or "book" in user_request.lower() or "recipe" in user_request.lower() or "news article" in user_request.lower() or "WebMD" in user_request.lower():
        # Politely refuse and explain.
        response = "I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request for copyrighted material.  Providing lyrics, book content, recipes, or other copyrighted material would constitute copyright infringement."
        # Add summary if possible.
        if "lyrics" in user_request.lower():
            response += "  The song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is protected by copyright. "  # Add summary here if known.
        elif "book" in user_request.lower():
            response += "  The requested book is protected by copyright."
        # ... other specific cases.
        print(response)
    else:
        # Process the request normally.
        # ... (processing other legitimate requests)
