## **Prompt for Gemini AI: Assembling a Computer**

---

### **Prompt Description**

#### **Role:**  
Computer Builder Assistant  

#### **Task:**  
You will be provided with a JSON dictionary containing information about computer components. Based on these components, your responsibilities include:  

1. **Determine the build type** (e.g., gaming, office, workstation, etc.).  
2. **Generate a descriptive title and detailed description** of the build in **both Hebrew and Russian**.  
3. **Translate component names and descriptions** into Hebrew and Russian.  
4. **Return the response** in JSON format, structured as specified.  
5. **Ensure correct formatting** of all quotation marks and structure in the output.

### **Input Format:** JSON  

**Example Input:**
```json
[
  {
    "product_id": "<leave as is>",
    "product_title": "<component name>",
    "product_description": "<description and specs>",
    "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>"
  },
  {
    "product_id": "<leave as is>",
    "product_title": "<component name>",
    "product_description": "<description and specs>",
    "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>"
  }
]
```

---

### **Output Format:** JSON  

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "he": {
    "build_types": {
      "gaming": 0.9,
      "workstation": 0.1
    },
    "title": "️<Your build title>",
    "description": "<Your build description>",
    "products": [
      {
        "product_id": "<product_id>",
        "product_title": "<Hebrew component name>",
        "product_description": "<Hebrew component description>",
        "specification": "<Hebrew component specification>",
        "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>",
        "language": "he"
      }
    ]
  },
  "ru": {
    "build_types": {
      "gaming": 0.9,
      "workstation": 0.1
    },
    "title": "️<Your build title>",
    "description": "<Your build description>",
    "products": [
      {
        "product_id": "<product_id>",
        "product_title": "<Russian component name>",
        "product_description": "<Russian component description>",
        "specification": "<Russian component specification>",
        "image_local_saved_path": "<leave as is>",
        "language": "ru"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
... (rest of the code)
```

## <algorithm>

The algorithm is implicit within the prompt itself.  It requires the AI to:

1. **Receive input:** A JSON array of component details.
2. **Analyze components:**  Identify the types of components (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) and their specifications.
3. **Predict build type:**  Assess the components to determine the likely build type (gaming, workstation, etc.) and assign probabilities.
4. **Translate:** Translate component names and descriptions into Hebrew and Russian.
5. **Generate output:** Format the results in a structured JSON format, including translated titles and descriptions, and probabilities of build types.

```

**Dependencies:**

The provided code snippet doesn't directly reference external libraries or specific systems.  The dependencies are conceptual: the model needs language translation capabilities and the ability to process JSON.


## <explanation>

This code defines a prompt for a large language model (likely Gemini AI), instructing it on how to assemble a computer.

* **Imports:** There are no imports in the strict sense. This is a prompt, not a program. The prompt describes the expected input and output format as JSON.
* **Classes:**  The code does not define classes in the conventional object-oriented programming sense.  It structures the prompt using natural language to specify the expected behavior and data exchange patterns.  The 'role' of "Computer Builder Assistant" denotes the task's nature, while 'Task' outlines the AI's responsibility.
* **Functions:** The prompt implicitly defines steps as functions: `determine the build type`, `translate`, `generate title/description`.  The prompt itself acts as the instruction set for the AI.
* **Variables:**  Variables are implicit within the prompt. The model processes inputs provided in JSON format, containing  `product_id`, `product_title`, `product_description`, and others. The model is expected to manipulate these variables and output similar, structured variables in the output.


**Possible Errors/Improvements:**

* **Ambiguity in component categorization:** The prompt lacks specific rules for interpreting component data and assigning probabilities to build types. Without clear criteria for determining gaming/workstation characteristics, results could be inconsistent.
* **Missing error handling:** The prompt doesn't define how the AI should handle incomplete or inconsistent input data.
* **Translation quality:**  The prompt emphasizes accurate translations but doesn't specify the translation method. Reliance on AI-based translators alone might not guarantee perfect quality, especially for technical terms.

**Relationships to other parts of the project (if applicable):**

This prompt represents an interface/instruction set for a likely broader system or API that would process the JSON data and perform translations. The prompt acts as the initial, specific interaction point.

In summary, the code is a set of instructions for a language model, not an executable program.  The prompt's design ensures the AI correctly parses the input, categorizes the components, determines the build type, translates items into both languages, and outputs the resulting data in a structured JSON format.
