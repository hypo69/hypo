# nopt - Node.js option parser

This module provides a flexible and robust option parser for Node.js applications.  It handles various option types, including strings, paths, numbers, dates, booleans, arrays, and streams, making it suitable for a wide range of command-line tools and configuration utilities.

## Key Features

* **Flexible Option Types:** Supports a rich set of data types for options, allowing you to validate and handle different kinds of inputs effectively.
* **Shorthands:**  Define concise abbreviations for common options, improving usability for command-line interactions.
* **Abbreviations:**  Handles abbreviated options gracefully, allowing users to enter shortened forms of option names.
* **Unknown Options:**  Tolerates unknown options, allowing for future expansion and flexibility in your application.
* **Error Handling:** Provides configurable error handling for invalid options, with the ability to suppress warnings or customize error reporting.
* **Remaining Arguments:** Preserves the remaining command-line arguments after parsing options in the `argv.remain` property.
* **Type Validation:** Verifies that input values match the specified types, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.


## Installation

```bash
npm install nopt
```

## Usage

The example in the README demonstrates how to use `nopt` to define options and handle them:

```javascript
var nopt = require("nopt")
  // ... (your code) ...
  var parsed = nopt(knownOpts, shortHands, process.argv, 2)
```

This parses command-line arguments against your `knownOpts` and `shortHands` definitions and returns a parsed object.

## Example `knownOpts`


```javascript
knownOpts = {
  "foo" : [String, null],
  "bar" : [Stream, Number],
  "baz" : path,
  // ... other options
}
```


This example defines a `foo` option that accepts a string or null, a `bar` option that accepts a stream or number, a `baz` option as a path, and so on.


## Advanced Features

* **Custom Types:** Extend the library's built-in types by adding new validators to `nopt.typeDefs`.

* **Cleaning:** Use `nopt.clean(data, types, typeDefs)` to sanitize a configuration object and remove invalid properties.


## Error Handling

`nopt` offers customizable error handling through `nopt.invalidHandler`.


## Detailed Explanation (from the README)


The README provides a comprehensive explanation of:

* Supported types (String, path, URL, Number, Date, Boolean, NaN, Stream, Array)
* How to define custom types.
* Error handling mechanisms.
* Usage of abbreviations and shorthands.
* Handling remaining arguments (`argv.remain`, `argv.original`, `argv.cooked`).
* Argument slicing (`process.argv` handling).


**Important Note:** The provided README provides a clear and concise overview of the nopt module. Refer to the `lib/nopt.js` file (and potentially associated test files) for more in-depth examples, edge cases, and detailed explanations.
