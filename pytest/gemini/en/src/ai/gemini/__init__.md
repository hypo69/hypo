**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Missing Class:** The provided code only defined a constant `MODE`.  I've added placeholder tests (`@pytest.mark.skip`) for `GoogleGenerativeAI`.  These tests are commented out because there's no actual class defined to test.  **You need to provide the full `GoogleGenerativeAI` class for meaningful tests.**

2. **Example Test Structure:** The example test functions are now significantly improved:
   - They use `pytest.raises` for checking exceptions (like missing API keys).
   - They have clear docstrings explaining the test's purpose.
   - The examples show how to check different attributes and methods.
   - It demonstrates how to write tests for constructor arguments.

3. **API Interaction Mocking (Crucial):**  The tests marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` need **significant** changes.  You can't directly call the Google AI API inside your tests because you're simulating them. This requires a mocking library (like `pytest-mock`) to stub out the API call and return simulated results.  **This is essential for writing robust tests that won't depend on external services.**

4. **Error Handling:** Added a test (`test_google_generative_ai_missing_api_key`) to illustrate handling when a required parameter (like an API key) is missing or incorrect.

5. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests need to be expanded based on the methods and data structures used in `GoogleGenerativeAI`  to cover valid inputs, edge cases, and possible exceptions.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the test code:**  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_gemini.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_gemini.py
    ```

**To make these tests functional, you MUST provide the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class and any necessary dependencies.  The test file will need to be updated to properly match the methods and expected behavior within the actual `GoogleGenerativeAI` class.  The mocking (and `pytest-mock`) is needed to create realistic tests.**
