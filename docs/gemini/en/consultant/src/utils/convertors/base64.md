# Changes Made

*   Added import `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Added type hints (`-> str`) to functions for better code clarity and maintainability.
*   Implemented robust error handling using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error` for better error management.
*   Added informative error messages to `logger.error`.
*   Added `TypeError` and `ValueError` exception handling.
*   Added detailed docstrings (reStructuredText) for all functions and modules.  These follow Sphinx style docstring conventions and are more comprehensive than the initial docstrings.
*   Removed unnecessary comments.
*   Updated variable names to be more descriptive.
*   Corrected `base64_to_tmpfile` function to return `None` on error.
*   Added detailed error messages to the `base64encode` function.
*   Added `FileNotFoundError` handling to `base64encode` for better error handling.
*   Removed unnecessary comments and code (`#! venv/...`).
*   Improved variable names (`content`, `file_name`).
*   Added `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` imports.
