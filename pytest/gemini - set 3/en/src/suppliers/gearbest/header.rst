**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The `test_settings_json_load_exception` and `test_readme_file_not_found` functions now use `patch` to mock the `gs` module's `Path` object, which is crucial for isolated testing. This prevents the tests from trying to access and potentially modify the real `settings.json` file.

2. **Robust Error Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` to test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, ensuring proper exception handling is verified.

3. **Dummy File Creation (test_set_project_root_valid_input):**  A dummy `pyproject.toml` file is created before the test and removed afterwards. This prevents the test from unexpectedly failing due to the absence of this file.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are made more descriptive and explicit about the conditions they test.

5. **sys.path Patching(test_set_project_root_path_in_sys_path):**  Added a test to verify that the root path is correctly inserted into `sys.path`. This is crucial for the code's functionality.

6. **Mocking gs.path:** Instead of relying on a real `gs` module that may not be defined in a test environment, you need to mock `gs.path.root`. The `mocked_gs_path` fixture helps with this.

7. **Explicit `GEARBEST_PATH`:** Added a `GEARBEST_PATH` constant to make the tests more maintainable and less prone to typos.  Update this constant to the actual path to `hypotez/src/suppliers/gearbest` if the code is in a different location.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.


Remember to replace placeholders like `GEARBEST_PATH` with the actual path if needed.  Crucially, make sure your test files are in the same directory as the files they are testing, or adjust the path accordingly.  If you have a `gs.py` module, it needs to be in a location accessible to the test script.
