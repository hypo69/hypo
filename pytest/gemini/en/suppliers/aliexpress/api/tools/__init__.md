**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing Implementation:** The provided code only imports `get_product_id`.  To make these tests work, you need the actual implementation of `get_product_id` from the file `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/tools/get_product_id.py`.  The test code assumes `get_product_id` takes a URL string as input.  Adjust the test cases according to the actual parameters and return values of your function.

2. **Error Handling:**  The `pytest.raises` context manager is crucial for testing exceptions.  The `assert` statements within the `with` block verify that the correct exception type is raised and that the exception message contains the expected string.

3. **Test Data:** The example data is placeholder.  You need to replace these with the appropriate test data for your specific input.

4. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The provided tests are a starting point.  You need to add more tests to cover various scenarios, such as different URL formats, URLs that do not correspond to valid products, and potentially different error conditions depending on how `get_product_id` is implemented.

5. **Specific Errors:** Add tests to check for `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, etc.  You should create tests specifically for different error conditions.

6. **Edge Cases:** Consider invalid input formats, empty strings, `None` values, and other edge cases.

7. **Mocking:** If the `get_product_id` function makes external calls (e.g., to an API), use `pytest-mock` to mock those calls to avoid external dependencies in your tests.


Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pytest
