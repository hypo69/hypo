**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`, ensuring various aspects are checked.

2. **Type Checking:** Added checks to ensure that `__version__`, `__doc__`, and the values inside `__details__` are of the expected types (e.g., `Version` for `__version__`, `str` for `__doc__` and values in `__details__`).

3. **Edge Case/Invalid Input Handling:**  The tests now validate that `__doc__` and `__details__` are not empty, which is an important edge case.  

4. **Import Error Handling:** Included a basic `test_import_another_module` example.  Crucially, it uses `try...except` to gracefully handle potential `ImportError`s.  This prevents tests from failing unexpectedly due to missing imports. **Always do this for testing code that imports other modules.**

5. **MODE Constant Handling:** If the `MODE` constant is not present (it's commented out in your example code, but this might change), a `pytest.skip` function is used to skip the test gracefully.

6. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of the test easier to understand.

7. **Docstrings for tests:** This is good practice to explain the purpose of each test.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger_examples.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_logger_examples.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.


This improved test suite is more robust and provides better coverage, making it less prone to unexpected failures. Remember to adapt these tests to the specific structure and contents of your actual code. If your code has more complex logic and methods, ensure to test them thoroughly. Remember to adapt and add tests specifically to what your code is doing.
