Module for starting Facebook advertisement posting campaigns.
=========================================================================================

This module provides functionality to initiate and run advertisement campaigns on Facebook.
It utilizes the FacebookPromoter class to manage the campaign execution process, handling
the loading of group data, and performing posting actions.


Example Usage
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # ... (Import necessary modules) ...
    start_posting_katia()

# Example usage (Uncomment to run)
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     start_posting_katia()

```

## Changes Made

*   Added missing import `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Added RST-formatted docstrings to the `start_posting_katia` function.
*   Added detailed error handling using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error`.
*   Replaced `d` with `driver` for better variable naming consistency.
*   Added `finally` block to ensure the webdriver is closed.
*   Improved JSON loading with error handling.  Corrected and expanded comments.
*   Added a `__main__` guard for better modularity.
*   Simplified and enhanced code style.
