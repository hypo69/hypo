```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt.gemini_traigner as gt

def test_mode_is_dev():
    """Checks if the MODE variable is correctly set to 'dev'."""
    assert gt.MODE == 'dev'
```

**Explanation and Justification:**

The provided Python code (`gemini_traigner.py`) contains only a few lines defining a constant `MODE`.  There are no functions or methods to test.  The above test suite provides a single test case that verifies the value of the `MODE` constant, which is the only executable code in the input.  

**Why other test cases are not needed (and why this is crucial):**

There's no meaningful code to test beyond verifying a simple constant.  Writing tests for something that doesn't perform calculations, manipulate data, or execute logic wouldn't yield much value. The test suite is kept minimal and focused on the only verifiable aspect of the code provided.

**How to Improve Further:**

If the intention was to test other parts of the `hypotez` project, it would be necessary to provide the relevant source code files. A more comprehensive test suite would require code with functions and/or methods.  Providing functions to test with different inputs, expected outputs, and edge cases would allow for a thorough set of tests.  Adding error handling and exception testing scenarios (e.g., using `pytest.raises`) would be essential for robust testing.  Missing or incomplete code makes it impossible to write useful test cases beyond the trivial one given.
