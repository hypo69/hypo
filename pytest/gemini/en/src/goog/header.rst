**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The code now correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions that the code is designed to handle, making the tests more robust.

2. **`monkeypatch` for `__file__`:** Using `monkeypatch` to set `__file__` during testing is essential for testing this function, as the function relies on the current file's location.

3. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The test now leverages the `tmp_path` fixture from pytest for creating temporary directories and files. This is critical for isolating tests and avoiding interference with the filesystem.

4. **`mock_files` Fixture:**  Introduces a fixture to efficiently create the necessary files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) in the temporary directory, making tests more readable and maintainable.

5. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test names are more descriptive, explicitly stating the input conditions being tested.

6. **Parameterization:** The `test_set_project_root_valid_input` now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` for more flexibility in testing different tuples of `marker_files`.

7. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Now covers cases where marker files are present at different levels of directories and even if no marker files are found. Also handles cases where a subfolder might be present instead of the files.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Place the test code (above) in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/goog/header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved solution significantly strengthens the testing coverage, making the tests more reliable and comprehensive. Remember to replace `TEST_DIR` and `TEST_PATH` placeholders with the actual paths if they are different. If your `gs` module is not in the same directory as your test file, you might need to adjust the import statements or add a path.
