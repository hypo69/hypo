How to use the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/header.py` file

This file, `header.py`, initializes critical variables for the project, primarily related to its configuration and documentation. It's designed to be included at the top of other files within the project.

**Key Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root()`:**
   - **Purpose:** Locates the project root directory.
   - **How it works:** It starts from the directory of the current file (`__file__`) and recursively checks parent directories for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). The first directory containing any of these markers is considered the project root.  Crucially, it also adds the root directory to `sys.path`. This is important for importing modules from within the project structure.
   - **Args:** A tuple of file or directory names to search for.
   - **Returns:** A `Path` object representing the project root directory.  If no marker files are found, it returns the directory of the current file.

2. **Project Metadata Loading:**
   - **Purpose:** Loads project metadata (name, version, author, copyright, documentation, etc.) from `settings.json` and `README.MD` files.  It handles potential errors like files not being found or invalid JSON.
   - **How it works:**  It attempts to load data from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json'` and `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'README.MD'`, providing sensible defaults if the files are missing or invalid. The `gs.path.root` variable (presumably defined elsewhere) is essential for correctly finding the location of these files relative to the project root.

3. **Variable Initialization:**
   - **Purpose:** Initializes project-related variables like `__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc. from the loaded metadata.
   - **How it works:** Uses the loaded `settings` dictionary to fill in these variables.  Defaults are set if corresponding keys are missing or the loading fails.


**Example Usage (in another file):**

```python
from hypotez.src.goog.spreadsheet.header import __project_name__, __version__

print(f"Project: {__project_name__}, Version: {__version__}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path`:** This code assumes a `gs` module (likely `goog/spreadsheet/path.py`) defines a `path` attribute with methods to construct paths relative to the project root.  You need to implement the `gs.path` module.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions. This prevents the entire program from crashing if the metadata files are missing or corrupted.
* **`sys.path` Modification:**  Adding the project root to `sys.path` allows the import of modules located within subdirectories of the project root without needing to adjust the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (which would not be ideal for other users interacting with your project).
* **`__root__` Variable:**  This variable is critical for relative pathing throughout the project.  Proper path construction is essential for avoiding hardcoded paths.
* **`MODE = 'dev'`:**  This variable is present, but its significance isn't explicitly clear from this code snippet.  It's likely used for conditional logic or different behaviors in development or production modes.


**Before using this code:**

1. Make sure the `gs` module and `gs.path` are defined and correctly handle path construction.
2. Ensure `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git` (or other specified marker files) exist within the project root to properly locate it.
3. Verify `settings.json` is correctly structured and in the expected location.


This usage guide provides a complete explanation of the `header.py` file's purpose and usage. It emphasizes the importance of relative paths, error handling, and the `sys.path` modification for successful module import within the project. Remember to adjust the explanation to match your actual project structure and requirements.
