```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling for cases where "hypotez" wasn't found in the path. The `test_root_path_calculation` and `test_root_path_edge_cases` now include tests for these situations, using `pytest.raises` to check for `ValueError` exceptions.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more explicit (e.g., `test_root_path_calculation`, `test_root_appending_to_sys_path`).

3. **Edge Cases:**  Added tests to cover cases like "hypotez" being at the beginning of the path and the case of "hypotez" not existing. The `test_root_path_edge_cases` function encapsulates these edge cases.


4. **Correct Path Manipulation:** The example now correctly determines the parent directory of the current path rather than relying on relative paths, ensuring proper handling for varying file structures.

5. **Preservation of Original State:** The `test_root_appending_to_sys_path` test now saves and restores the original `sys.path` to prevent side effects on subsequent tests.

6. **Example Usage (Important):**  To effectively test these functions, you'll need to create a sample directory structure mirroring your project that includes the `hypotez` directory.  The examples in the test cases demonStarte how to change the working directory to facilitate those tests.  **Without a proper directory structure, the tests might not reflect the intended behavior of the code.**

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


**Crucial Note:**  The `test_root_path_edge_cases` tests require you to create "hypotez" and "another_dir" directories and files in the appropriate directory structure to appropriately reflect your environment.


This improved solution addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust set of tests for the provided Python code. Remember to adapt the directory structure for testing to align with your actual project structure.
