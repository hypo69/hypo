<input code>
```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

<algorithm>
1. **Import:** The code starts by importing the `calculate_sum` function from the `src.utils.calculator` module.  This indicates that the `calculate_sum` function is defined elsewhere, potentially within a module related to mathematical operations.

2. **Define `add_numbers` function:**  A function named `add_numbers` is defined, which takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, representing the numbers to be added.

3. **Call `calculate_sum`:** Inside the `add_numbers` function, the `calculate_sum` function is called with `a` and `b` as arguments.  This function is expected to compute the sum of the two input values.

4. **Return the result:** The result returned by `calculate_sum` is assigned to the variable `result`.  The function then returns this `result`.

**Example:**

If `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the `calculate_sum` function will be called with these values.  Assuming `calculate_sum` returns the correct sum, `result` will be 8, and the `add_numbers` function will return 8.

<explanation>
**Imports:**

- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `utils` package, which is part of the `hypotez` project (as indicated by the `src` prefix).  This means the `calculate_sum` function is likely defined in a file named `calculator.py` (or similar) that's part of the `hypotez` project's codebase.

**Function `add_numbers`:**

- **Purpose:** The `add_numbers` function simply encapsulates the process of adding two numbers by delegating the actual addition to the `calculate_sum` function. This promotes modularity and code reusability, as the `calculate_sum` function could be used in other parts of the project without needing to be redefined.

- **Arguments:**
    - `a`: The first number to add.
    - `b`: The second number to add.

- **Return Value:** The sum of `a` and `b` as calculated by `calculate_sum`.


**Relationship with Other Packages:**

- The `src.utils.calculator` module is part of the `hypotez` project's utility code. Its existence suggests other utility functions or classes might also be present within this project.

**Possible Improvements:**

- **Error Handling:**  The code lacks error handling. If `calculate_sum` encounters an error (e.g., non-numeric input), the `add_numbers` function will likely propagate this error without any mitigation.  Adding input validation (checking if `a` and `b` are numeric) within `add_numbers` is a good practice to improve robustness.

- **Type Hinting:**  Adding type hints (e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) would significantly improve code readability and allow static analysis tools to detect potential type-related issues.

- **Docstrings:**  Including docstrings in both `calculate_sum` (in the `src/utils/calculator.py` file) and `add_numbers` would improve documentation and understanding of their functionalities.
