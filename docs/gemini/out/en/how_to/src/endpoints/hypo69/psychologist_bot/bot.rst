How to use the PsychologistTelgrambot class
==========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a Telegram bot (`PsychologistTelgrambot`) designed to interact with users.  It utilizes the `telegram` and `google-generative-ai` libraries, and leverages a Google Drive-based file system (`gs`) and a `Driver` object (likely for web interactions).  The bot's key functionality involves processing user messages, generating responses using a large language model (LLM), and potentially handling URLs for specific actions (e.g., retrieving pricing information). It also handles voice and document uploads.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The `PsychologistTelgrambot` class is instantiated.  It retrieves the Telegram bot token from a configuration (`gs.credentials.telegram.hypo69_psychologist_bot`).
2. **Driver and Model Setup**: It initializes a `Driver` object (likely for web interaction), and a `GoogleGenerativeAI` model. The system instructions and questions are loaded from specific files in Google Drive.
3. **Handler RegiStartion**: The bot registers various handlers to handle different types of user input:
    - `/start` command: Sends a greeting message.
    - `/help` command: (Presumably) implements help functionality (not fully detailed in the code).
    - Text messages: Processes user text input, saving the message to a log file, sending it to the LLM for a response, and then sending the LLM's response back to the user. The response generation leverages historical chat data from a file associated with the user.
    - Voice messages: Likely to handle voice messages (the `handle_voice` handler is present but not detailed).
    - Document uploads:  Handles uploads of documents; the code extracts and displays the file content.
    - URLs:  The `get_handler_for_url` method checks for specific URLs (like those for suppliers and onetab) to route the message to a specific handler.
4. **Handling URLs**:
     - `/suppliers` URLs (and their variants) are routed to the `handle_suppliers_response` function, which interacts with the `mexiron` object (another class/module not fully detailed here) to process the URL and produce a result.
     - Other URLs (like from "onetab") are handled by their respective functions.
5. **Handling Commands**: The `handle_next_command` function allows interaction based on user-inputted commands (e.g., retrieving random questions).
6. **Application Run**: The `asyncio.run` method starts the Telegram bot's polling loop, listening for incoming updates and handling them accordingly.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assume gs is already initialized and credentials are properly set.
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.psychologist_bot.bot import PsychologistTelgrambot
    
    # Initialize the bot
    kt = PsychologistTelgrambot()
    
    # ... (Other setup code, e.g., handling Telegram API setup) ...

    # Run the polling loop
    asyncio.run(kt.application.run_polling())
