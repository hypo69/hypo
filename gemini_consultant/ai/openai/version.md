```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is handling the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  The original code would crash if `settings.json` wasn't found or was malformed. Now, it prints a warning and sets `settings` to an empty dictionary. This prevents the script from failing.  **Critically important** for robustness.
* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function. This is essential to correctly handle files with characters outside the ASCII range, which is very common in JSON files.
* **Empty Settings:** If the `settings.json` file is missing or the data within is corrupted, the code now assigns an empty dictionary to `settings`. This prevents errors later when trying to access keys that might not exist.
* **Typo Fix:** Corrected the typo in `__copyright__` to `copyright`.
* **Readability (optional but recommended):** Removed redundant `if settings` checks. The use of `settings.get()` implicitly handles cases where the `settings` dictionary might be `None` or don't have the specific key.


**How to use this improved code:**

1.  **Create `settings.json`:**  Make sure you have a `settings.json` file in the `src` directory of your project. This file should contain valid JSON, and look like this:

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Your Copyright",
  "cofee": "https://anotherlink.com"
}
```

2.  **Run the script:**  The `version.py` file will now function correctly even if there are no settings.  This means your other modules that import it won't unexpectedly fail, which is excellent!


This revised code is far more robust and reliable in handling potential issues. Remember to adjust the `settings.json` example with your actual project data.
