Evaluation result for C:\Users\user\Documents\repos\hypotez\src\___beeryakov\version.py:

**No issues found.**

The file appears to be a standard Python module defining a version string (`__version__`) and an author (`__author__`).  The shebang line (``) is a common way to specify the Python interpreter to use on Windows when the script might be run directly.  The `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` declaration is also standard and correct.  No significant issues or code smells are present.

**Recommendations:**

* **Docstrings:** Consider adding a more comprehensive docstring to the module, explaining its purpose and the meaning of the version string.
