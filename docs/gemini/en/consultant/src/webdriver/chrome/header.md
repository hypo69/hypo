# Changes Made

*   Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` for JSON handling.
*   Added import `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings to the `set_project_root` function and module-level docstrings.
*   Refactored variable names to follow a consistent naming convention.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for file loading failures instead of `try-except` blocks for improved error handling and reporting.
*   Replaced `...` placeholders with specific error handling using `logger.error` and including `exc_info=True` for better debugging.
*   Removed unnecessary docstring for `__root__` variable.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific descriptions for improved readability.
*   Fixed typo in `copyrihgnt` variable name to `copyright`.
