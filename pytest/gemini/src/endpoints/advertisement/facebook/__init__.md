**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  A `facebook_data` fixture is introduced to provide reusable test data for the Facebook class. This is essential for avoiding code repetition and making tests more maintainable. Replace `"your_access_token"` with actual token values in your test environment.  Crucially, if the methods or classes take additional arguments, those should be incorporated into the fixture too.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, reflecting the test's purpose (e.g., `test_facebook_init_missing_account_id`).

3. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to assert that the appropriate exceptions are raised with invalid inputs.  Includes clear error messages in the `match` argument for better debugging.

4. **Edge Cases:** Test cases now cover scenarios like missing required arguments and invalid event IDs.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The provided example tests are a starting point. You need to expand these to cover all methods, attributes, and potential scenarios in your `Facebook`, `FacebookFields`, and `FacebookPromoter` classes.  Important to remember to test both the successful and exceptional cases (e.g., invalid arguments, missing data).

6. **Mocking:** If your code interacts with external services (e.g., making HTTP requests), you would likely want to use `pytest-mock` (or `unittest.mock`) to mock those interactions.  A good practice is to test both the success and failure cases for a realistic test suite.

7. **Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose and logic of each test case, making the tests more readable and understandable.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Replace Placeholders:**  The placeholder values (e.g., `"your_access_token"`, `"invalid_event_id"`) need to be replaced with actual values relevant to your test environment.

- **Data Driven Tests:**  If there are many valid input scenarios for the functions, consider using data-driven testing with `pytest.mark.parametrize` for better organization.

- **External Dependencies:** If your code interacts with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs), ensure you have appropriate setups and mocks for testing without impacting your environment or relying on external systems to be available.

- **Error Handling:**  Thoroughly test the error handling pathways to ensure robust code under various scenarios.


Remember to adapt these test cases based on the actual methods and structure of your `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/__init__.py` file.  Complete and robust testing usually requires more cases. Consider including edge cases, invalid inputs, potential failure modes, and scenarios where you're expecting certain exceptions to be raised.
