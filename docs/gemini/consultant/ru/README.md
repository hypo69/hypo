**Improved Code**

```python

# Contains utility functions and classes used throughout the project,
# including data formatting, parsing, and string processing.
from src.logger import logger
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns
import json  # Standard JSON library

def load_json_file(file_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Loads data from a JSON file.

    :param file_path: Path to the JSON file.
    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
    :raises json.JSONDecodeError: If the file contains invalid JSON.
    :return: Loaded JSON data as a Python dictionary.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            data = j_loads(f)  # Using j_loads for JSON loading.
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading JSON file: {e}")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        logger.error(f"Invalid JSON in file: {e}")
        raise


# Example usage (for testing):
# try:
#     data = load_json_file('data.json')
#     # Process the loaded data...
# except Exception as e:
#     logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Changes Made**

- Added a `load_json_file` function to handle JSON loading.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added comprehensive docstrings to the `load_json_file` function using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Implemented error handling using `logger.error` to log errors and exceptions.
- Included a `try...except` block for robustness, using `logger.error` to log the specifics of any exception encountered while loading the file or parsing the JSON.
- Added appropriate import statements.
- Included comments in RST format for the functions.
- The example usage is commented out for better readability.
-  Improved error handling by distinguishing between `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` and logging specific error messages.
