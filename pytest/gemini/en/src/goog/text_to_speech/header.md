**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Temporary Files:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create temporary `settings.json` and `README.MD` files. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding interference between them.  The `tmp_file.unlink()` in the fixture ensures the files are deleted after each test.

2. **Explicit Error Handling:** Tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, making the tests more robust and informative.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

4. **Complete Test Coverage (Partial):**  The provided example covers basic functionality, error handling (file not found), and edge case (no marker files).  However, additional tests are needed to cover all aspects of the `header.py` code, such as:
   - **`set_project_root` edge cases:**  Testing with marker files in different locations, nested directories, and various invalid input scenarios.
   - **`settings` loading:**  Tests for `settings.json` files with different structures, empty files, and various error conditions.
   - **`doc_str` loading:** Similar tests for `README.MD` as done for `settings.json`.
   - **`__root__` use in subsequent code:** Verify that the `__root__` value is correctly used in other parts of the project.


5. **Mocking `sys.path`:** The `@patch.object(sys, "path", [])` decorator in some test functions is used to isolate and control the `sys.path` fixture for testing purposes. It ensures the tests don't modify global variables in your application.



**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

Remember to adapt and extend these tests based on the actual functionality and error handling needed in the `header.py` file. This revised example provides a structured approach to writing complete, more robust tests for your project.


**Important Considerations:**

- **`gs` module:** The tests should include checking for potential issues or misuses related to the `gs` module (which is imported). If this module has its own tests, it's best to integrate those tests into the larger test suite.

- **Error Handling in `settings` and `doc_str`:** The `try...except` blocks in `header.py` handle potential errors. Make sure your tests are designed to trigger these error conditions and verify that they are handled appropriately.

- **File System Interactions:** Be mindful when testing file operations. Temporary files and directories are often used in such tests.


This more comprehensive approach should improve the testing of your code significantly. Remember to replace placeholders with actual test data and error scenarios relevant to your `header.py` code.
