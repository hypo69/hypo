# Improved error handling and clearer variable names.  
# The previous code was vulnerable to silent failures.
# Explicitly handling the potential for empty dictionaries/missing keys.

```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.  Critically, it prints informative error messages to the console.  Crucially, it now exits the script with an error code (1) if it fails to find a project root - preventing the script from continuing if it can't find necessary files.
* **Explicit `encoding`:**  The `readme_path` now has `encoding='utf-8'` added to the `open()` function. This is essential, especially when dealing with files that might contain non-ASCII characters, otherwise the script could raise an exception or return incorrect data.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `__root__` instead of `__root__: Path` and removing unnecessary type hints in `__project_name__` and others improves readability.
* **Handling Missing Settings:** The code now sets `settings` to an empty dictionary (`{}`) if `settings.json` is not found or invalid.  This is often a better approach than letting a missing value raise an exception.
* **Corrected Spelling:** Fixed a spelling error in `__copyright__`.
* **Robustness:** The code now checks that `__root__` exists, which is vital for preventing potential errors if the project root is not correctly identified.


This revised code is significantly more robust and handles potential errors in a much more informative and controlled way.  The inclusion of the error handling is crucial for real-world applications. Remember to adapt the error handling strategy to match your specific needs.
