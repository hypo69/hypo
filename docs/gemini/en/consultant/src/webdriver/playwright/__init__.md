Module for Playwright webdriver interaction.
=========================================================================================

This module provides a class for interacting with web pages using Playwright.

Example Usage
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright import Playwrid

    driver = Playwrid()
    # ... your Playwright interaction code ...
"""
# Mode variable
MODE = 'dev'

# Import Playwrid class
# from .playwrid import Playwrid # Import statement fixed
from .playwright import Playwrid # Fixed import path to match file name
```

# Changes Made

*   Corrected the import path for the `Playwrid` class. The original import `from .playwrid import Playwrid` was incorrect. The correct import is `from .playwright import Playwrid`.
*   Added a module-level docstring in reStructuredText (RST) format to describe the purpose and usage of the module. This improves documentation and readability.
*   Added a more informative example usage block within the module-level docstring.
