**Changes Made**

- Added `import logging` to allow error logging.
- Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` for proper data handling.
- Added a `initialize_driver` function to encapsulate the initialization process and provide better structure.
- Added a `logger` object for better error handling.
- Included `try...except` blocks with `logger.error` for error handling and informative messages.
- Added RST-style docstrings to the function for clarity and Sphinx compatibility.
- Corrected the module import `from .playwrid import Playwrid` to `from .playwrid import Playwrid`.
