## Changes Made

- Added missing `import` statement for `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added missing `import` statement for `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
- Wrapped all `try-except` blocks with error logging using `logger.error`.
- Added RST-style docstrings for the `set_project_root` function and the module.
- Corrected the casing of `copyrihgnt` to `copyright` in the settings loading.
- Improved variable naming (e.g., `__root__` to `project_root`).
- Added type hints for function parameters and return values where applicable.
- Added more descriptive variable names for better readability.
