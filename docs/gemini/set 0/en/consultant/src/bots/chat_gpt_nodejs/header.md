# Changes Made

*   Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `gs.j_loads` for consistent data handling.
*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to the `set_project_root` function and other functions, variables.
*   Implemented error handling using `logger.error` for file loading and other critical operations, instead of using bare `try-except` blocks.  This makes error reporting more robust.
*   Used `Path` objects for file paths, which is more robust.
*   Improved variable naming conventions to be more descriptive and in line with Python best practices.  For example, `__root__` changed to `root_path`.
*   Added a default value to the `settings` dictionary in case of an error, preventing a `TypeError` later on.
*   Added missing docstrings and parameter types for clarity.
*   Used more precise language in docstrings and comments to avoid vague terms like "get" or "do."
*   Corrected the indentation and formatting of the code for consistency.
*   Added comments to explain the code blocks and their functionality.
