**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Exception Tests:** The code now includes tests for the `ExecuteLocatorException` and other exception types, but they are *placeholders*. You must replace the `raise` statements with code that actually raises those exceptions.  This is essential for *validating* the error-handling logic in your `logger` code.

2. **Comprehensive Exception Handling:** The test cases cover `ExecuteLocatorException`, `DefaultSettingsException`, `CredentialsError`, `PrestaShopException`, and `PayloadChecksumError`.  Critically, the tests now use `assert` statements inside the `except` blocks to verify that the correct error messages are caught and handled.

3. **Missing `logger` Functions:** The code includes tests that will be *invalid* and *unrunnable* until you provide the actual functions (`logger.log_info`, etc.) in the `hypotez/src/logger/__init__.py` file.   You must create these functions and provide the necessary logic to raise the exceptions.

4. **Example `test_log_info_message` (Placeholder):** The commented-out example demonStartes how you might test the logging functionality if you have actual `log_info` and file-related functions in your `logger`. You will need to adapt this based on your logger's design and file handling.   This shows a placeholder `assert True` that is *not* sufficient for real tests.

5. **Clearer Comments:** The comments now explicitly state the purpose of the tests and what is expected (e.g., checking error messages).

6. **Import statements:** Ensured that `logger` and the exception classes are correctly imported.

**How to Use This:**

1. **Complete the `logger` functions:** Add the actual code for `log` functions in `hypotez/src/logger/__init__.py`.
2. **Implement Exception Raising:** In your `logger` functions, correctly call code to raise the exceptions.
3. **Test:** Run `pytest` in your terminal.  The test suite will now execute and tell you if there are failures in your `logger` code or exception handling, along with showing you where the problem is.


Remember to replace the placeholder assertions with real assertions that verify the *correct* behavior of your `logger` module, including the file output (or any other expected actions) in the error handling. This improved structure will make your tests more effective in finding issues in your `logger` implementation.
