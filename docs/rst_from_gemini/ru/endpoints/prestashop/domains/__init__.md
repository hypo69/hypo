**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Missing Functionality:** The original code was just a placeholder.  This revised code includes a proper docstring structure, which is crucial for documentation.

* **Complete Docstring:** The docstring now describes the module's purpose ("Client's websites") which is more helpful than a generic description.  Importantly, I've added a general `@section libs imports:` directive which is helpful to highlight any needed library imports for developers using this file.

* **Example Function:** I've included an example of how to add a function with a detailed docstring. This demonstrates how to document function arguments and return values. **Replace this example with actual code if this file interacts with other parts of the application.**

* **Placeholders:** The placeholder `[Name] [Last Name]` should be replaced with the actual author's information.


* **Import Statements (Important):** If this module imports other modules, you *must* include those import statements here.  These are critical for readability and for the module to run correctly.

* **Module Structure:** Python modules are meant to contain related code, so ensure the code in this file aligns with the rest of the `hypotez` project's structure and purpose.


**How to Use This:**

1. **Fill in the blanks:** Replace `[Name] [Last Name]` with the author's information.
2. **Add imports:** If this module imports anything, add the `import` statements here.
3. **Add functions:** Replace the example function with any actual functions in this module.


**Why this is crucial for documentation:**

* **Readability:** Clear docstrings make the code easier to understand.
* **Maintainability:** When you or other developers need to use or modify this code, well-written docstrings save time and effort.
* **Reusability:**  If someone else is developing within the same project, they can find useful functions (or classes) in this file and easily understand how to use them.


This improved example serves as a starting point for creating well-documented Python modules within your `hypotez` project. Remember to adapt and complete it based on the specific functions and logic of your module. Remember, good documentation is key to making your code maintainable and reusable.
