How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that finds the root directory of a project.  It then loads settings from a `settings.json` file and project documentation from a `README.MD` file, if they exist.  Finally, it sets several variables holding project metadata, such as name, version, and author, based on the loaded settings.  Crucially, it adds the project root to Python's module search path, enabling import of modules within the project.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules, including `sys`, `json`, `packaging.version`, and `pathlib`.


2. It defines the `set_project_root` function.  This function takes an optional `marker_files` argument to specify files or directories used to identify the project root directory.


3. The function starts by resolving the current file's path and using that as the initial candidate for the root.


4. It iterates upward through the directory hierarchy (parents of the current path), checking if any of the `marker_files` (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) exist within the parent directory.


5. If a parent directory contains any of the specified marker files, that parent directory is declared as the root directory and the loop is broken. Otherwise, the function continues looking until it finds the root or reaches the top level.


6. The function adds the found root directory to the Python path (`sys.path`). This allows Python to import modules from the project's subdirectories.


7. The function returns the determined project root directory.


8. The code then calls `set_project_root()` to get the project root.


9. The code attempts to open a JSON file (`settings.json`) within the project root and load its contents into the `settings` variable.  If the file is not found or the JSON is invalid, a `...` (ellipsis) is executed, essentially skipping to the next step.


10. The code attempts to open a Markdown file (`README.MD`) within the project root and read its contents into the `doc_str` variable.  If the file is not found or the Markdown is malformed, a `...` (ellipsis) is executed.


11. The code initializes several variables, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`, with default values or values extracted from the `settings` dictionary if it's available.  These variables essentially store metadata about the project.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming the file is in a project with pyproject.toml, settings.json, README.md)
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.etzmaleh.header import set_project_root

    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(root_dir)  # Output: Path to the project root.
    print(__project_name__)  # Output: Project name from settings.json or default.
