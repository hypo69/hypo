**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The `@pytest.fixture` `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` are crucial.  They allow you to control the input data for the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files, removing dependencies on actual file existence and contents.
* **Mock `gs.path`:**  The `mock_gs_path` fixture creates a temporary directory and mock `gs.path.root` so your tests can run without real files, and therefore are not affected by the existence or non-existence of files on the system.  This is critical for truly isolated tests.
* **`pytest.raises` for exceptions:** The tests now use `pytest.raises` for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. This is correct exception handling practice for your try/except blocks.  The tests check these are handled correctly.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Tests `set_project_root` with cases where marker files are in different levels of parent directories or when no marker files exist.
* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:** Includes tests for various scenarios, including cases where files don't exist.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during the file loading process to demonstrate the proper error handling.

**How to Run:**

1.  Install `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Place the test file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/header.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


This revised solution is much more robust and reliable, demonstrating best practices for writing `pytest` tests, particularly when dealing with file I/O and exception handling.  It uses the `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` for creating temporary files and directories, which is a much better approach than trying to work with the real file system within a test. Remember to replace `gs` with the actual module path if it's different.
