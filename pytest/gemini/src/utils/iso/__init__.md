```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided tests now cover the *specific* content of the given code (which is only a `MODE` variable).  Crucially, the tests now correctly check the type and value of that variable.

2. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are explicit about what they test.

3. **Isolation:** Each test function is independent, as required.

4. **Edge Cases (Simulated):**  If there were functions, example edge cases like empty strings or unusual data types would have been included.


5. **Exception Handling (Simulated):** Placeholder for testing exceptions.  Important if your code raises exceptions.


6. **Documentation:** Docstrings explain the purpose of each test.


**How to Adapt for Your Code:**

- **Replace placeholders:** If your file has functions, replace the commented-out placeholder function calls and assertions with your actual function calls and expected results.
- **Add fixtures:** If you need fixtures, add them following the example structure using `@pytest.fixture`.  Make sure you import and use them properly within the test functions.
- **Test specific function cases:** Add tests for each function, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and exception handling.


**Running the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named something like `test_iso.py` (or similar, following Python naming conventions) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest` from your terminal to execute the tests.


Remember to replace the placeholder code with the actual code from your file for meaningful tests.
