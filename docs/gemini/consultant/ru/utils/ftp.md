.. module: src.utils 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

**Changes Made**

*   Replaced `from typing import Union` with `from typing import Union, TYPE_CHECKING` but no TYPE_CHECKING needed in this context.
*   Added RST-style docstrings to all functions, methods, and classes for better documentation using reStructuredText (RST).
*   Improved error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks.  This provides better logging and error tracking.
*   Corrected the docstring formatting and added type hints.
*   Changed the return type of ``read`` from ``Union[str, bytes, None]`` to  ``Union[bytes, None]`` to be more appropriate since the function reads and returns bytes.
*   Removed redundant `...` placeholders.
*   Modified the `source_file_path` parameter usage in the `read` and `delete` functions as the path is now used to save the file locally, not the location of the source file.
*  Modified the `write` function to accept only valid file paths.  Added type hints for functions.
