**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically, the code now uses `monkeypatch` to mock `Path.exists` and `Path.open`.  This is vital for testing these functions in isolation. The `mock_exists` and `mock_open` functions are now defined to control what `Path.exists()` and `open()` return during the tests.  This allows you to test cases with files present, files not present (a critical edge case), and even bad data.

2. **Robust File Handling:** The tests now mock opening the files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`) and check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. The `test_load_settings_file_not_found` and `test_load_settings_invalid_json` tests are added to test these cases.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** The tests have more descriptive names, making it easier to understand their purpose.

4. **Fixture for Project Root:** A `project_root` fixture is introduced to create a temporary directory structure for testing.  This ensures you are not testing against the real file system.  The crucial step now is the mock file creation and directory setup for testing.

5. **Edge Cases:** The tests now include cases where marker files might not exist or be in different locations to properly test the "search upwards" logic.

6. **Exception Handling:** Tests explicitly verify that `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are handled correctly.

7. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test suite now covers valid inputs, the cases where the marker files aren't found and situations with different file types for the marker files.

8. **sys.path Modification:** The `test_set_project_root` function now takes the `monkeypatch` fixture, allowing you to effectively manipulate the sys.path for your tests. This is essential for correct path handling.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_header.py`

Remember to replace `"my_project_root"` with the actual path that your project should use.  Also,  `test_settings.json` and `test_readme.txt`  are needed as placeholder files in the directory where you are running the test.


This revised solution significantly improves test coverage and robustness, accurately reflecting the potential edge cases in the original code. Remember to run this extensively and adjust the mock data appropriately to ensure your tests capture various real-world scenarios.
