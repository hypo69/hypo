**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Crucial for testing functions that interact with external services (like the browser).  The `mock_supplier` fixture now creates a mock `Supplier` and `Driver` object. This isolates the tests from the actual browser and dependencies.
* **Mock Logger:** A mock logger is used to prevent any actual logging during the tests.  This makes the tests cleaner and faster.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** The tests now include scenarios where the input supplier object is `None` or does not have the necessary methods.  This covers potential errors.
* **Explicit Exception Handling:** The `test_close_pop_up_exception` tests for and expects the `Exception` to be handled within the `try-except` block. It also tests that a warning message is correctly logged.
* **`caplog`:** Included to capture the warning messages printed by the logger.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Improved assertions to more clearly reflect what is being tested.
* **Example Locator:** A dummy locator is defined in the mock_supplier fixture to make the tests compile without having to define a full locator structure in the supplier object.


This improved test suite is much more robust in terms of handling various potential issues and edge cases, and the use of mocks ensures that the tests run quickly and independently. Remember to replace the placeholder `'close_pop_up_locator'` in the `mock_supplier` fixture with the actual locator from your `Supplier` object. Remember to import `pytest` and `patch` from `unittest.mock`.
