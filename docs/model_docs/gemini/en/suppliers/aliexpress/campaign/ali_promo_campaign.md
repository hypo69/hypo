**Explanation and Improvements:**

*   **Clearer Structure:**  The RST now has a better structure, separating functions, classes, and module contents into logical sections.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:**  Function and class docstrings are used effectively to provide clear explanations, including parameters, return values, examples, and any relevant details.
*   **`.. automodule`:** The `.. automodule` directive correctly includes all members and undoc-members of the `AliPromoCampaign` class.
*   **`.. toctree::`:** The `.. toctree::` directive is used in the `index.rst` file to include links to the module descriptions (this requires a file named `modules.rst` in the same directory, which would contain the `toctree` section).
*   **Docstring Examples:** The docstring examples now follow the Python code's formatting.
*   **Corrected Function Names:**  The function names are now correctly referenced using the full import path.
*   **Complete Import Paths:**  Import paths are used in `.. autofunction` and `.. autoclass` directives.
*   **TOC Tree Placeholder:** A placeholder `modules.rst` is required to populate the `.. toctree::` directive with links.
*   **Error Handling:** Docstrings now describe exception handling appropriately.
