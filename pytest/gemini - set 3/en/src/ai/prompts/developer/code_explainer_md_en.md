```python
# The user-provided code goes here
# (No code provided in the prompt)
```

```python
import pytest

# (No fixture needed as no code was provided.)


# (No tests can be written without code)
```
**Explanation:**

The prompt requests test cases for Python code using the `pytest` library. However, there is no Python code provided for testing.  Therefore, I have created an empty code block and a set of empty test functions.

**How to proceed:**

To generate the test cases, you need to provide the actual Python code you want to test.  I will then analyze the code and create appropriate `pytest` tests following the provided instructions. Please provide the Python code you want tested.
