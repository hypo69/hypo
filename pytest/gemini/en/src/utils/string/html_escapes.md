**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better describe the test's purpose.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added tests for invalid inputs (missing keys, non-string keys), edge cases (newline characters), and empty input.

3. **Error Handling:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `KeyError` when accessing non-existent keys and `TypeError` when encountering non-string inputs.


4. **Unicode Character Support:**  Added a dedicated test (`test_html_escapes_unicode_characters`) to verify handling of various Unicode characters.  This is crucial since the input data includes a wide range of characters.


5. **`get()` Method:**  Added a test (`test_non_existent_keys`) to demonstrate how to handle cases where a key might not be present in the `html_escapes` dictionary. The `get()` method is used to safely retrieve values, avoiding `KeyError`.

6. **Example for Specific Character:**  Added `test_euro_symbol` to demonstrate testing a specific character (`€`) with expected output.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_html_escapes.py`).
2.  Ensure the `hypotez` package is structured properly, so the import `from hypotez.src.utils.string.html_escapes import html_escapes` works.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_html_escapes.py`.


**Further Considerations:**

- **More Edge Cases:** Consider testing with characters that might have special encoding requirements or behavior in HTML contexts (e.g., control characters).
- **Performance Testing (optional):** If performance is a concern, consider adding tests to measure the time taken to look up characters in the `html_escapes` dictionary (especially if the dictionary is large).
- **Input Validation (optional):**  If the intended use is to accept user input for characters to be escaped, add tests to ensure the expected behavior when an invalid character is provided as input.



This improved test suite provides a more comprehensive and robust set of tests that covers a broader range of scenarios, including error handling and edge cases, which is crucial for thorough testing. Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific expected behavior of the `html_escapes` dictionary if necessary.
