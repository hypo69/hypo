**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is robust error handling.  The `set_project_root` function now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the project root cannot be found.  Crucially, the code now catches this exception and provides a fallback mechanism (setting `__root__` to the current directory, and prints a helpful error message).  This prevents cryptic crashes. The `settings.json` loading is also improved.
* **Explicit `None` Check:** The code now explicitly checks if `settings` is `None` before attempting to access keys like `settings.get("project_name")`. This prevents `AttributeError` exceptions if `settings` is not properly loaded.
* **`doc` key in settings:**  Added a `doc` key to `settings.json` for consistency.  A `doc` key often holds a description of the project.
* **Meaningful Fallback:** Setting `settings` to an empty dictionary (`{}`) if loading fails is better than simply leaving it `None` as an empty dictionary at least indicates no project-specific data was loaded.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Changed `settings_file` to `settings_file` for better readability.
* **Print Statement:** Added a `print()` statement to debug what the determined value of `__root__` is.  This is crucial for local development.


**How to Use:**

1.  **`settings.json`:** Create a `settings.json` file in the `src` directory of your project with the following structure:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My AliExpress Campaign Project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "doc": "Description of the project",
  "details": "More details about the project",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright Information",
  "cofee": "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
}
```

2.  **Run the script:** The script now will handle cases where the necessary files are missing or cannot be found, making it more robust.  You will need to have the proper `gs` and `src` structure already setup as implied by the import statements in the code.


This revised solution is much more robust and maintainable, handling potential issues with file paths and avoiding common Python errors. Remember to adjust the file paths and keys in `settings.json` to match your project structure. Remember to install the `pathlib` and `json` library if you don't have them already.


```bash
pip install pathlib json
```
