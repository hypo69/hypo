**Changes Made**

- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON loading.
- Added error handling with `try...except` blocks and logging using `logger.error` to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions when loading settings and README.
- Created `load_settings` and `load_readme` functions for better organization and code reusability.
- Improved variable names for better readability (e.g., `PROJECT_ROOT`, `settings`).
- Added docstrings in RST format for functions and variables.
- Docstrings are improved for clarity and follow RST conventions.
- Removed unnecessary comments and variables.
- Fixed potential issues with corrupted or missing files by setting defaults to empty strings and dictionaries where necessary.
