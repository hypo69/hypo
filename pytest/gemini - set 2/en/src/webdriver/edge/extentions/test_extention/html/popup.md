# No Python code to test in the provided HTML.  Therefore, no tests are possible.
#  The provided HTML is just a webpage and does not contain any functions or methods to test.


#  Example of how to test a potential Python script that might have been associated
#  with this HTML file if the structure was different.  This is place-holding.

# Example Python code (replace with your actual code)
# def greet(name):
#     """Greets the person with their name."""
#     if name is None:
#         raise ValueError("Name cannot be None")

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is a static webpage, not Python code.  Therefore, no testable Python functions or classes exist within the context of the provided snippet.  

To write meaningful `pytest` tests, you *must* provide the corresponding Python code that interacts with the HTML (e.g., a JavaScript code handling events, an underlying Python script that fetches data, etc.).

The example I've added shows a placeholder Python function (`greet`) and how tests would be written around it if it were present.  It demonstrates the structure you should follow, including:

*   **Fixture**:  A fixture (`user_data`) is used to provide data to the test functions.  This is very common and is essential in testing complex scenarios.
*   **Clear test function names**: The test function names (`test_greet_valid_input`, `test_greet_invalid_input`) are clear about the purpose.
*   **Exception handling (`pytest.raises`)**: This is used correctly to test for the `ValueError` expected if a `None` is passed to `greet`.
*   **Edge case tests**: The `test_greet_long_name` test demonstrates handling a longer name, making the test more comprehensive.
*   **Valid input**: The `test_greet_valid_input` covers the basic expected behavior.


**How to proceed with testing your code:**

1.  **Provide the Python code:**  The key is to provide the Python code (or JavaScript code) that uses and interacts with the HTML. This code needs to be the focus of your tests.

2.  **Identify testable units:**  What are the functions, classes, or methods you want to test?

3.  **Define clear test cases:** Based on the identified units, devise tests that cover:
    *   Valid inputs.
    *   Invalid inputs (e.g., `None`, empty strings).
    *   Edge cases (e.g., maximum or minimum values).
    *   Exceptional conditions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).
    *   Boundary conditions.


Once you provide the Python code, I can help you write accurate and comprehensive `pytest` tests.
