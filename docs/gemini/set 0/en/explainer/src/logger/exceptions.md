.. module: src.logger.exceptions
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: This module defines custom exceptions used in the application.

Program Exceptions
------------------

This module contains several custom exception classes to handle errors related to various application components, including file operations, product fields, KeePass database connections, and PrestaShop WebService errors.

Classes:
--------
- CustomException: The base custom exception class that handles logging.
- FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file is not found.
- ProductFieldException: Raised for errors related to product fields.
- KeePassException: Raised for errors related to KeePass database connections.
- DefaultSettingsException: Raised for when there are issues with default settings.
- WebDriverException: Raised for errors related to WebDriver.
- ExecuteLocatorException: Raised for errors related to locator executors.
- PrestaShopException: Raised for generic PrestaShop WebService errors.
- PrestaShopAuthenticationError: Raised for authentication errors with PrestaShop WebServices.

**Example Data Flow (CustomException):**

1. A function in the application raises a `CustomException` with a message ("File not found") and an original exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).
2. The `__init__` method of `CustomException` logs the custom exception message as an error using the `logger` object.
3. If an `original_exception` is provided, it logs a debug message containing the details of the original exception.
4. The `handle_exception` method includes a placeholder for potential recovery/retry logic, which isn't implemented in the example.

**Dependency Analysis:**

- `logger`: Imported from `src.logger`.  This suggests that the logging mechanism is defined in a separate module within the same project (`src`).  There's a dependency on the `logger` object for error reporting.
- `WebDriverException`: Imported from `selenium.common.exceptions`. This indicates the project uses Selenium for web browser automation. The `WebDriverException` subclass is redefined in the `logger/exceptions.py` module to add custom logging behavior.
- `CredentialsError`, `BinaryError`, etc.: Imported from `pykeepass.exceptions`. The project likely uses the `pykeepass` library for interacting with KeePass databases.


## <explanation>

- **Imports:**
    - `from typing import Optional`: Imports the `Optional` type from the `typing` module for type hinting. This allows for types to be declared as optionally containing a value.
    - `from src.logger import logger`: Imports the `logger` object from the `src.logger` module. This object likely handles logging operations within the application.  This suggests a clear separation of concerns between application logic, logging, and exception handling.
    - `from selenium.common.exceptions import WebDriverException as WDriverException`: Imports the `WebDriverException` class from Selenium, used for handling browser-related errors.  The `as WDriverException` renames the imported class to avoid naming conflicts. This shows the project has integration with Selenium.
    - `from pykeepass.exceptions import ...`: Imports various exception types from the `pykeepass` library for handling KeePass database interactions, including authentication and data errors.  This indicates use of the PyKeePass library.

- **Classes:**
    - `CustomException`: A base exception class that provides a standardized way to handle exceptions, including logging the original exception (if it exists) and adding handling. This promotes consistent error management throughout the application.
    - `FileNotFoundError`, `ProductFieldException`, `KeePassException`, `DefaultSettingsException`, `WebDriverException`, `ExecuteLocatorException`, `PrestaShopException`, `PrestaShopAuthenticationError`: These are custom exception classes derived from either `Exception` or `CustomException` which provide specific error types for different parts of the application, improving the readability and maintainability of error handling.

- **Functions:**
    - `__init__` method in `CustomException`: This method initializes the custom exception with a message and an optional original exception. It is crucial for properly reporting errors.
    - `handle_exception` method in `CustomException`:  This method is intended for adding recovery or retry logic, providing a structure for developers to implement error handling and recovery Startegies.

- **Variables:**
    - `MODE`: A variable set to 'dev'. This suggests the code is intended for development environments, and its value could be changed for production to alter behavior.

- **Potential Errors/Improvements:**
    - **Recovery Logic:** The `handle_exception` method in `CustomException` currently has a comment that indicates the need for error recovery logic. Implementing retry mechanisms or other recovery methods (like logging error details and letting the application continue) would greatly improve robustness.
    - **Exception Context:**  While logging the original exception is beneficial, consider adding context in the log messages (e.g., the calling function or file location) to make debugging easier.
    - **Clearer Error Messages:**  In `PrestaShopException`, the `__str__` method could be improved to provide more informative error messages including the `error_code` and custom message in a structured way.


**Relationship Chain:**

The `logger` in `src.logger` is crucial for proper error handling and communication. This module likely interacts with other parts of the project where errors might be raised. The `CustomException` and other derived classes provide a way to catch errors from various parts of the application and log them using `logger`.  The usage of specific external libraries (Selenium, PyKeePass) demonStartes the project's need to interact with outside services and handles errors arising from these interactions appropriately.
