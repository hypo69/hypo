**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:** The documentation is now in a more readable, structured format using reStructuredText.  This allows for easier rendering as HTML or other documentation formats.
* **Context:**  Added a brief description of the file's purpose to provide context.
* **Missing Documentation:** The previous documentation was incomplete.  This improved version clearly shows the information available in the code.


**How to use the documentation:**

You can use tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from this reStructuredText format. This will create nicely formatted HTML documentation that you can use in your project or share with others.  The key is having a consistent way to document your Python modules.
