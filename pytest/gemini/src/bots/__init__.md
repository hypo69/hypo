**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import necessary modules:** The code now imports `TelegramBot` from the correct location.

2. **`test_telegram_bot_creation`:** This test verifies that `TelegramBot` can be instantiated without errors.  Crucially, it *asserts* the instance type. This is essential for basic class functionality checks.

3. **`test_telegram_bot_mode`:**  This test checks if the `MODE` variable is correctly set to 'dev'.  This is a crucial sanity check to ensure the module is configured as expected.

4. **Placeholder for Method Tests (`test_telegram_bot_*`):** The original code lacked method tests. I've included commented-out examples (`test_telegram_bot_send_message_*`). Replace the placeholder comments with actual tests if the `TelegramBot` class has methods you want to verify (e.g., `send_message`, `get_updates`, etc.).  Make sure to:
   - **Use `pytest.raises` for expected exceptions:** If a method is expected to raise an exception for specific invalid inputs, use `pytest.raises` to catch and verify the exception type and message.  The example shows how to test for a `TypeError` or other exceptions.
   - **Simulate API calls (if needed):** In the placeholder example, I've commented a placeholder for the `send_message` test.  If `send_message` interacts with an external API, you should mock or stub the API call for the tests to avoid dependency on an external service, or otherwise, handle that correctly in your tests.

5. **Clear test descriptions:** The test function names now clearly indicate the purpose of each test case.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_bots.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/bots/__init__.py` file (or adjust the import paths if needed).

2. Run the tests using `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

This improved testing framework provides more robust and comprehensive testing for your `TelegramBot` class, covering both its instantiation and (if methods exist) its behavior with different inputs.  Remember to replace the placeholder tests with real tests based on the actual functionality of your `TelegramBot` class. Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific methods and expected behavior of your `TelegramBot` class.  Replace the placeholder methods with tests that directly test the actual functionalities.  If external dependencies are involved, mock them appropriately in the tests.
