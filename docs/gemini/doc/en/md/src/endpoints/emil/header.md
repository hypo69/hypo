# hypotez/src/endpoints/emil/header.py

## Overview

This module contains initialization code for the Emil endpoint, including the retrieval of project settings and version information from configuration files.  It primarily aims to define key variables crucial for running the project, such as the project root directory, project name, version, and documentation.


## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: This function dynamically determines the project root directory by searching upwards from the current file's location. It checks for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) to accurately locate the project root.


**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): A tuple containing filenames or directory names to use as markers for finding the project root. Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.


**Returns**:

- `Path`: The path to the project root directory. If no marker files are found, it returns the directory where the script is located.


**Raises**:

- No exceptions are explicitly raised.
