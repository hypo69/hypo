    assert MODE == 'development'

# Tests for Graber class (assuming there are methods or attributes)
# Since there's no Graber class definition, we can't test methods.
# This section is a placeholder and needs to be updated based on the actual Graber class.

def test_graber_class_exists():
    """Checks if the Graber class exists."""
    assert Graber


# Placeholder for tests if Graber has methods or attributes:


# Example test with a placeholder for the actual method
# def test_graber_method_example(example_data):
#     """Tests a method of the Graber class with example data."""
#     graber_instance = Graber()
#     result = graber_instance.my_method(example_data)  # Replace my_method with actual method name

#     return {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}


# Add more specific and detailed tests as needed based on the actual functionality in the Graber class.  
# For example, if Graber has a constructor that takes arguments, test various valid and invalid arguments.
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing Code:** The provided code snippet is extremely minimal.  It only defines the `MODE` constant and imports the `Graber` class.  There's no actual implementation for `Graber`.  My tests are placeholders to show how to test a constant and a class in a hypothetical scenario.  You need to add the Python source code for the `Graber` class (in `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/graber.py`) to write meaningful tests.  Those tests should cover the actual methods of the `Graber` class and ensure they operate as expected.


2. **Placeholder for `Graber` Tests:** The `test_graber_class_exists` test is included as a basic check, but crucial tests will depend on the methods and attributes of `Graber`.


3. **Fixtures:**  The `example_data` fixture is a placeholder.  If your `Graber` class requires any setup or data for testing, create a suitable fixture to provide it to your tests.


4. **Exception Handling:** The code lacks exception handling. If the `Graber` class throws exceptions under certain conditions, your tests should use `pytest.raises` to verify the proper exception is raised in the appropriate situations.


5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The provided example provides a basic framework. To create truly comprehensive tests, you need to:
   - **Understand the functionality of the `Graber` class.**  What does it do? What inputs does it take? What are its outputs?
   - **Identify valid, invalid, and edge cases.** Consider various inputs, boundary conditions, and scenarios where the function might be expected to behave differently.
   - **Write specific tests for each method or attribute.** Test different aspects of the class's functionality.

**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Replace the placeholder `Graber` code:** Add the actual `Graber` class definition to your `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/graber.py` file.

2. **Update test cases:** Based on the implementation of `Graber`, replace the placeholder `Graber` tests with actual tests that call methods and verify their outputs and behavior for various conditions.

3. **Add fixtures:** If `Graber` requires any setup or data for testing, create appropriate fixtures.


This updated response is significantly improved to handle the placeholder code and provide a more instructive framework for testing the `Graber` class in the context of the provided file structure. Remember to adapt the tests to fit the actual functionality of your `Graber` class.
