**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover `__version__`, `__author__`, `__details__`, `__doc__`, `MODE`, and `__name__`, including checks for their data types and (where appropriate) for non-empty values.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**  The test `test_docstring_content` checks for empty docstrings (which could indicate a problem in the code's logic).

3. **Missing Function Handling:** `test_missing_function` demonStartes how to test if the expected functions are present.  This should be updated if the module contains functions.

4. **External Resource Considerations:**  `test_external_resource_access` highlights the need for tests related to external data sources (files, networks) or configurations.  Since there is no external interaction in the provided code, a pass-through is included. This placeholder should be filled in with relevant tests if needed.

5. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific, clearly stating what is expected in each case.

6. **Error Handling:**  Uses `pytest.raises` for potential exceptions if functions in the module raise errors.

7. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose and logic of each test.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as the `version.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.

**Crucial Next Steps (if applicable):**

-   If the module in `version.py` defines functions, you'll need to add tests that verify their functionality as well. Use `pytest.raises` to test exceptions they might raise.
-   If the module interacts with files, external services, or configurations, add appropriate tests to cover those interactions.
