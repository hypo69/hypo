# delayed-stream

Buffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.

## Installation

```bash
npm install delayed-stream
```

## Usage

This example demonstrates a simple HTTP echo server that delays its response by 1000 milliseconds.

```javascript
const DelayedStream = require('delayed-stream');
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);

  setTimeout(() => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    delayed.pipe(res);
  }, 1000);
});

server.listen(3000);
console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
```

If you don't use `Stream#pipe`, manually release the buffered events using `delayedStream.resume()`:

```javascript
const delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);

setTimeout(() => {
  delayed.resume(); // Emit buffered events and resume the underlying source
}, 1000);
```

## API

### `DelayedStream.create(source, [options])`

Creates a new `delayedStream` object.

*   `source`: The stream to buffer.
*   `options`: (Optional) Configuration options.

    *   `pauseStream`: (Boolean, default: `true`) Whether to pause the underlying `source` stream upon creation.  Changing this after creation has no effect.
    *   `maxDataSize`: (Number, default: `1024 * 1024`) The maximum data size to buffer (in bytes for Buffer objects, characters for strings) before emitting an error.  Set to `Infinity` to disable this protection.  Modifying this after creation does affect the current buffering process.

Returns a `delayedStream` object.

### `delayedStream.source`

The original stream object. Useful for accessing properties of the source stream.


### `delayedStream.pauseStream`

The value of `pauseStream` option passed during `DelayedStream.create`.

### `delayedStream.maxDataSize`

The maximum data size to buffer.

### `delayedStream.dataSize`

The current amount of buffered data.


### `delayedStream.readable`

Getter for `source.readable`.


### `delayedStream.resume()`

Releases the buffered events and resumes the underlying stream.  Effectively equivalent to calling `delayedStream.release()` then `delayedStream.source.resume()`.


### `delayedStream.pause()`

Pauses the underlying `source` stream.


### `delayedStream.pipe(dest)`

Pipes the buffered events to the destination. Calls `delayedStream.resume()` internally.  Essentially a convenient shortcut to `delayedStream.resume(); source.pipe(dest);`


### `delayedStream.release()`

Emits all buffered events and clears the buffer. Does *not* resume the underlying stream; use `delayedStream.resume()` for that.


## Error Handling

Error events are buffered like other events.  `DelayedStream.create` installs a no-op error listener on the `source` stream, so you only need to handle errors on the `delayedStream` object itself.

**Improvements:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The revised documentation is more concise and focused on the essential usage aspects.
*   **Example Enhancement:** The example now demonstrates a complete, working HTTP server example.
*   **API Explanation:**  The API section is significantly improved, providing clear explanations for each method and property, including crucial details about the `pauseStream` and `maxDataSize` options, and the difference between `pause()` and `resume()`.
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling description is now more straightforward.
*   **Code Structure:**  Uses code blocks properly for code examples.
*   **Modern JavaScript:** The revised code example uses modern `const` and `let` where appropriate.
*   **Missing `server.listen`:** The original example was missing `server.listen` to start the server. This has been fixed.
*   **Parameter clarification:** Clarified that options are optional and how the `source` parameter is used.


This revised documentation is much more user-friendly and practical. Remember to adjust the `server.listen` call with the appropriate port number for your setup. Remember to install `delayed-stream` with `npm install delayed-stream`.
