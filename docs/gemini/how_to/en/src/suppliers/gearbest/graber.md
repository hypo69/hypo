.. module: src.suppliers.gearbest
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class collects field values from the `gearbest.com` product page.
    For each product page field, a field processing function is defined in the parent class.
    If non-standard processing is needed, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, preliminary actions can be performed using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, you need to pass a value
    to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines
    and redefine its behavior.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Decorator Implementation:** The `close_pop_up` decorator is now correctly implemented and usable.  Critically, it now checks if `Context.locator_for_decorator` is set, avoiding errors if no locator is provided.
* **Decorator Application:** The `@close_pop_up()` decorator is correctly applied to the `grab_page` method. This is essential; without it, the decorator will not be active.
* **Error Handling:** The decorator now includes a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential `ExecuteLocatorException`.  This is vital in real-world applications.
* **`fetch_all_data` Method:** An example `fetch_all_data` method is created.  This method is crucial for calling individual field functions in an organized way.  Crucially, it now correctly takes keyword arguments, allowing for flexibility in the `grab_page` function call.

**How to use:**

```python
# ... (other imports and initialization)

async def main():
    driver = await Driver.create() # Initialize your driver
    graber = Graber(driver)
    product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='123', name='Example Product') # passing needed arguments
    # ... process the product_data ...
    await driver.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with your actual field retrieval functions.


This revised solution addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and practical example of how to use the decorator and fetch data in a structured manner.  You should still adapt the specific `fetch_all_data` and individual methods (`id_product`, `name`, etc.) to match your exact data extraction requirements. Remember to also implement error handling in your individual field functions (`id_product`, `name`, etc.).
