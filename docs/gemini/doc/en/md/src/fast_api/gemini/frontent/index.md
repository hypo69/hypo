# hypotez/src/fast_api/gemini/frontent/index.html

## Overview

This HTML file defines the front-end structure for a chat interface using a generative AI model. It sets up the basic page layout, including a title, styling with Bootstrap, and JavaScript inclusion.


## HTML Structure

The file utilizes standard HTML elements to structure the page, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.  It creates a container (`<div class="container">`) to hold the main content.


## Styling

The `style` tag within the `<head>` section customizes the page's appearance.  The `body` is given a padding for better layout.  The file also includes a link to a Bootstrap CSS file (`/static/bootstrap.min.css`) for responsive design and styling.



## JavaScript Inclusion

The `<body>` contains a `<script>` tag referencing `app.js` using the `src` attribute. This suggests that the JavaScript file, located in the `/static/` directory, handles the dynamic content and interactivity for the chat application.  The `<script>` tag is using `type="text/babel"` which indicates that Babel is used to transpile the JavaScript code before running.
