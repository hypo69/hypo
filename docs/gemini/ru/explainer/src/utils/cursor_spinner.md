# <algorithm>

**Algorithm:**

1. **`spinning_cursor()`:**
   - Enters an infinite loop (`while True`).
   - Iterates through the string '|/-\\'.
   - Yields each character.  

   *Example:*
   ```
   - Yielding '|'
   - Yielding '/'
   - Yielding '-'
   - Yielding '\'
   ```
   The generator `spinning_cursor` essentially produces a sequence of characters.

2. **`show_spinner()`:**
   - Takes `duration` and `delay` as input.
   - Initializes `spinner` with `spinning_cursor()` to get the generator.
   - Calculates `end_time`.
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues until `time.time()` is greater than `end_time`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Gets the next character from `spinner` using `next(spinner)`.
     - Prints the character to `sys.stdout`.
     - Flushes `sys.stdout` to ensure the character is immediately displayed.
     - Waits for the specified `delay` using `time.sleep()`.
     - Writes a backspace (`\b`) to the console to overwrite the previous character, keeping the cursor in place.

   *Example:*
   ```
   - Sets duration = 5 seconds
   - Sets delay = 0.1 seconds.
   - Gets first spinner character '|'
   - Prints '|' to console.
   - Waits 0.1 seconds.
   - Overwrites '|' with '/'.
   - Waits 0.1 seconds and so on.
   ```
   The `show_spinner` function effectively creates a continuously rotating cursor symbol.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `time`: Provides time-related functions, used for pausing and calculating time durations.
- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, used for interacting with the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`).

**Classes:**

There are no classes in this code.

**Functions:**

- `spinning_cursor()`:
    -  A generator function that yields the characters '|', '/', '-', and '\' in a cyclic manner.
    - Arguments: None
    - Returns: A generator object (yields each character).
- `show_spinner(duration: float = 5.0, delay: float = 0.1)`:
    - Takes `duration` (float) and `delay` (float) as arguments to control the spinner's duration and character display speed.
    - Prints a spinning cursor to the console for the specified `duration` with a given `delay` between characters.  
    - Arguments:
        - `duration`: The desired duration of the spinner in seconds.
        - `delay`: The delay between successive characters in seconds.
    - Returns: None.


**Variables:**

- `MODE`: A string constant, likely used for configuration but its value doesn't directly impact the spinner's function.
- `duration`, `delay`: Floats, representing time in seconds,  set to default values but can be changed when calling `show_spinner`.

**Possible Errors/Improvements:**

- **Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle potential exceptions (e.g., if `next(spinner)` raises an exception). Adding error handling would make the code more robust.
- **Clearer Documentation:** While docstrings are present, they could be made more comprehensive, particularly regarding the role of `sys.stdout.flush()` and `\b` (the backspace character) in controlling the cursor.  
- **Alternative libraries:**  Libraries such as `tqdm` or `progress` provide more features for showing progress bars and spinners with more detail and flexibility.
- **Alternative rendering**: The rendering method could be improved by using ANSI escape codes to generate the spinning cursor without clearing the previous character in the console.


**Inter-relation with other parts of the project:**

The `cursor_spinner` module likely belongs to a larger application or library, where it is used to visually signal loading times or other processes.  It is likely used within other modules in the project to display progress, thus facilitating the user experience.
