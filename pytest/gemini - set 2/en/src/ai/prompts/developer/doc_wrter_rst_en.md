**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder for Real Code:**  The code now has a placeholder for the actual `CodeAssistant` class.  Crucially, it includes the  `process_files` method with proper docstrings, parameter types, and expected return values and error handling.
2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
   - `test_process_files_valid_input`: Tests with valid input.
   - `test_process_files_invalid_input`: Tests incorrect input type.
   - `test_process_files_file_not_found`: Tests the `FileNotFoundError` exception.
3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test the exception handling.
4. **Clear Test Function Names:**  The test functions are descriptive.
5. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is independent.
6. **Example Usage (Important):**  The example usage section demonStartes what would happen if the code worked, not just what the tests ensure are possible errors.



**How to use these tests:**

1. Save the code above (including the placeholder for your actual `CodeAssistant` class) into a Python file (e.g., `test_code_assistant.py`).
2. Install pytest:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest test_code_assistant.py
   ```

Remember to replace the placeholder `# The user-provided code goes here` with the actual `CodeAssistant` class code for your tests to be meaningful.  The examples in the prompt were used to show a good general structure, not necessarily complete code.
