How to use the AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest class

This class, located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/_examples/rest/AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest.py`, allows you to retrieve featured promotional products from AliExpress.  It's a REST API call.

**1. Importing the Class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest import AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest
```

**2. Instantiating the Class:**

```python
# Create an instance of the class.  Specify the domain and port if needed, defaults are used if not provided.
request = AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest(domain="api-sg.aliexpress.com", port=80) 
```

**3. Setting Parameters:**

The class accepts various parameters to customize the request.  Here's how to set them:

* **`app_signature`**:  (Required)  Your application's signature.
* **`category_id`**:  Filter by category ID.
* **`country`**:  Filter by country.
* **`fields`**:  A string specifying the fields to return (e.g., "title,price").  Defaults to a full set of data.
* **`page_no`**:  Page number for pagination.
* **`page_size`**:  Number of items per page for pagination.
* **`promotion_end_time`**:  Filter by promotion end time (in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format).
* **`promotion_name`**:  Filter by promotion name.
* **`promotion_start_time`**:  Filter by promotion start time (in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format).
* **`sort`**:  Sorting criteria (e.g., "price_asc", "price_desc").
* **`target_currency`**:  Target currency.
* **`target_language`**:  Target language.
* **`tracking_id`**: Tracking ID.

```python
request.app_signature = "YOUR_APP_SIGNATURE"
request.category_id = 123  # Example
request.page_no = 1
request.page_size = 20
# ... set other parameters as needed ...
```

**4. Making the API Call:**

```python
try:
    # Call the get method.
    response = request.get() 
    # response will be a dictionary containing the API result.
    print(response)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The example code includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during the API call.  Always include error handling in production code.
* **Data Structures:**  The `response` will be a Python dictionary or object.  Examine the documentation for the expected structure of the data returned by the API.  The exact format depends on the response.
* **Authentication:**  Make sure you have the necessary authentication credentials (e.g., app signature) to make the API call successfully.
* **API Documentation:**  Refer to the official AliExpress API documentation for precise details on parameters, data structures, and error codes.  This is critical for correct usage.

**Example of handling the response (crucial):**

```python
try:
    response = request.get()
    if response and 'products' in response:  # Check if the 'products' key exists.
        product_list = response['products']  
        for product in product_list:
            print(product['title'])
            print(product['price'])
            # ... access other product details ...
    else:
        print("No products found or invalid response.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
