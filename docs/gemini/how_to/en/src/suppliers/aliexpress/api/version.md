## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/version.py`

This file defines the version information for the `aliexpress` API module within the `hypotez` project.  It's a Python module, and its contents are structured to provide versioning and metadata information.

**Key Variables and Attributes:**

* **`__version__`:** This string variable holds the version number of the module.  In this case, it's set to `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`.  This format appears to be custom and likely follows a specific versioning scheme used within the project.  You should consult the project's guidelines to understand the meaning of each part of this version string (e.g., major.minor.patch.x.y.z).

* **`__name__`:** This variable contains the name of the module (`'suppliers.aliexpress.api.version'`).  However, it's also set in a way that allows the script to be identified (and distinguish whether code is being imported or run directly) when running the script directly.

* **`__doc__`:** This string variable is the module's documentation string, which provides a description of the module's purpose.

* **`__details__`:** This string variable likely contains additional details about the module's version or the API it defines. In this case, it's set to `"Details about version for module or class"`.  The specific meaning and content depend on the project's internal documentation conventions.

* **`__annotations__`:** This is an empty variable.  You can use this variable to specify type hints or annotations for functions and variables within this module. This allows for static analysis and better code understanding.

* **`__author__`:** This string variable contains the author(s) of the module.  In this example, the author is set to `'hypotez'`.

**How to Use:**

This file is typically imported into other parts of the `hypotez` project.  Other modules or scripts that use this API can access the version information like this:

```python
import hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.version as api_version

print(api_version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(api_version.__name__)  # Output:  (variable depends on how the file is run)
print(api_version.__doc__) #Output: Module's documentation
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Versioning scheme:** Understanding the custom versioning scheme (e.g., `3.12.0.0.0.4`) is crucial. Refer to the project's documentation or guidelines to interpret the version correctly.
* **`__name__`:**  Note how `__name__` will be different depending on how this script is run.
* **Type annotations:** Use `__annotations__` to document types of variables and function arguments.  This makes the code self-documenting and improves maintainability.

**Potential Enhancements:**

* **`__date__`:** Consider adding a `__date__` variable to track the module's creation or last modification date.
* **`__version_info__`:** Create a tuple for version information (`__version_info__`). This can be beneficial for comparison and structured version checking.
* **External version control (e.g., `setuptools`)**: If this file is part of a distributable package, use `setuptools` to manage the versioning and metadata consistently.


This usage guide helps developers understand the structure and how to interact with the `version.py` file within the `hypotez` project.  It should be adapted to reflect the exact details and context of this specific module.
