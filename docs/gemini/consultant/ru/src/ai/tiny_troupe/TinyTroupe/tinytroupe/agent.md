"""
This module provides the main classes and functions for TinyTroupe's  agents.

Agents are the key abstraction used in TinyTroupe. An agent is a simulated person or entity that can interact with other agents and the environment, by
receiving stimuli and producing actions. Agents have cognitive states, which are updated as they interact with the environment and other agents. 
Agents can also store and retrieve information from memory, and can perform actions in the environment. Different from agents whose objective is to
provide support for AI-based assistants or other such productivity tools, **TinyTroupe agents are aim at representing human-like behavior**, which includes
idiossincracies, emotions, and other human-like traits, that one would not expect from a productivity tool.

The overall underlying design is inspired mainly by cognitive psychology, which is why agents have various internal cognitive states, such as attention, emotions, and goals.
It is also why agent memory, differently from other LLM-based agent platforms, has subtle internal divisions, notably between episodic and semantic memory. 
Some behaviorist concepts are also present, such as the idea of a "stimulus" and "response" in the `listen` and `act` methods, which are key abstractions
to understand how agents interact with the environment and other agents.

**Changes Made**

-   Added missing imports (`jjson`, `pretty_datetime`,  `OpenAIEmbedding`, `Settings`, `VectorStoreIndex`, `SimpleDirectoryReader`, `SimpleWebPageReader`, `openai_utils`).
-   Replaced `json.load` with `jjson.j_loads` for loading JSON data.
-   Added type hints (e.g., `: str` after variable names).
-   Improved docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format.
-   Added missing `logger` import, placed `logging.getLogger("tinytroupe")` statement at the beginning.
-   Added missing `utils` import from `tinytroupe` package.
-   Added a hardcoded default value for `embedding_model` if configuration file is not present or missing.
-   Moved default parameter values to the top of the file.
-   Improved variable names for clarity (e.g., `DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`).
-   Corrected indentation and formatting to follow PEP 8 style guide.
-   Corrected various typographical errors and inconsistencies in variable names.
-   Added missing `post_init` decorator to `TinyPerson` class.
-   Added default value for `communication_style` in the `TinyPerson` class, initializing it as `simplified`.
-   Fixed `assert` statements in `act` method for proper error handling.
-   Made sure `_post_init` function is available for deserialization as well as direct initialization.
-   Changed `_configuration` to a dictionary.
-   Added `_prompt_template_path` attribute to the `TinyPerson` class for storing the path to the prompt template.
-   Corrected `_post_init` method to initialize `_init_system_message`.
-   Implemented `def save_spec()` method to save configuration to a JSON file, allowing suppression of specific attributes.
-   Implemented `@staticmethod def load_spec()` method for loading from a file. Added suppress flags to prevent loading of specific memory/faculties.
-   Added `encode_complete_state` and `decode_complete_state` methods for serialization/deserialization, allowing the agent state to be captured and restored.  Important changes to properly serialize and deserialize the state, specifically concerning the agents that are accessible by the agent. Also includes methods to add and remove mental faculties and memory.
-   Added comments using RST format to explain the purpose and usage of various methods and attributes.
-   Consistently used single quotes (`'`) for string literals in the Python code.
-   Replaced `utils.pretty_datetime` with the `pretty_datetime` function in the module.
