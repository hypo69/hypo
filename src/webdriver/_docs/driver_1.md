This code defines a metaclass `DriverMeta` for dynamically creating a `Driver` class that inherits from both the base `Driver` class and a specified Selenium WebDriver class (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, or `Edge`). The metaclass is responsible for instantiating the correct combination of these classes. Here's a breakdown of what each part of this code does:

### `DriverMeta` Metaclass

A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. Here, `DriverMeta` is used to control the creation of a new `Driver` class.

#### `__call__` Method

The `__call__` method in a metaclass is invoked when you instantiate an instance of the class. In this case, it's used to create a new `Driver` class that inherits from both the `Driver` base class and one of the Selenium WebDriver classes (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, or `Edge`).

- `cls`: The class being instantiated, which is `Driver` in this case.
- `webdriver_cls`: The Selenium WebDriver class to inherit from (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, or `Edge`).
- `*args` and `**kwargs`: Arguments and keyword arguments to pass to the `Driver` class constructor.

#### Assertions

- `assert isinstance(webdriver_cls, type)`: Ensures that `webdriver_cls` is indeed a class.
- `assert issubclass(webdriver_cls, Chrome | Firefox | Edge)`: Ensures that `webdriver_cls` is a subclass of one of the allowed WebDriver classes (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, or `Edge`).

#### Dynamic Class Creation

Inside the `__call__` method, a new class named `Driver` is defined dynamically. This new class inherits from both `cls` (the base `Driver` class) and `webdriver_cls` (the specified WebDriver class).

##### `Driver` Class Constructor

- `__init__`: The constructor for the dynamically created `Driver` class.
  - Logs the initialization of the WebDriver with its name and arguments.
  - Calls the constructors of the parent classes using `super()`.
  - Calls a method `driver_payload`.

##### `driver_payload` Method

This method is defined inside the dynamically created `Driver` class and calls the `driver_payload` method from the parent `Driver` class. This ensures any additional initialization required by the `Driver` class is executed.

#### Returning the Dynamic Class

The newly created `Driver` class is instantiated and returned with the provided arguments.

### Example Usage

When you create an instance of the `Driver` class with `DriverMeta` as its metaclass and pass in a WebDriver class, it will dynamically create a new class that inherits from both the base `Driver` class and the specified WebDriver class.

For example:
```python
# Creating a Driver instance with Chrome as the WebDriver class
chrome_driver = Driver(Chrome, *args, **kwargs)

# Creating a Driver instance with Firefox as the WebDriver class
firefox_driver = Driver(Firefox, *args, **kwargs)
```

This allows you to instantiate a `Driver` class that has all the methods and properties of both the base `Driver` class and the specified Selenium WebDriver class (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, or `Edge`), enabling flexible and dynamic WebDriver instantiation with additional custom functionality.
