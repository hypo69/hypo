# No Python code to test, only JavaScript.  Therefore, no tests are possible.
# Tests would need to be written against a Python wrapper for the JavaScript.

# Example structure if tryxpath.isContentLoaded was a Python function:

# def test_is_content_loaded_valid():
#     """Checks correct behavior with valid input."""
#     # Assuming tryxpath.isContentLoaded returns a boolean value indicating content loaded
#     # Replace this with the actual implementation for your function call.
#     # Example using a mock for testing purposes
#     tryxpath.isContentLoaded = True
#     assert tryxpath.isContentLoaded == True
# 


# def test_is_content_loaded_invalid():
#     """Checks handling of invalid input (if applicable)."""
#     # Example for an error condition
#     # Replace this with the actual implementation for your function call.
#     # Assume tryxpath.isContentLoaded is supposed to raise an exception in certain situations.
#     try:
#         #Simulate invalid input.  Replace with your actual invalid input method
#         tryxpath.isContentLoaded = "not a boolean"
#         assert tryxpath.isContentLoaded
#     except TypeError as e:
#         assert "expected boolean" in str(e)

#     # Example for a non-existent property in the tryxpath object
#     try:
#         tryxpath.isContentLoaded = True
#     except AttributeError:
#         assert True  # Expecting the AttributeError, test passes
#     except Exception as e:
#         assert False, f"Unexpected exception: {e}"
#


# def test_is_content_loaded_edge_case():
#     """Checks behavior with edge cases."""

#     # Simulate edge cases in the JavaScript function


#     # Example: check if tryxpath is defined
#     try:
#         if not tryxpath:
#             assert False
#     except NameError:
#         assert True # Expecting the NameError if tryxpath is not defined.

#     tryxpath = {}
#     try:
#         tryxpath.isContentLoaded = True  # Set the property, expect no error
#     except Exception as e:
#         assert False, f"Unexpected exception: {e}"  # No exception, test passes

#     # Edge cases would be specific to the implementation of tryxpath.isContentLoaded
#     # You'll need to define what constitutes an "edge case".

#     # Example: check if tryxpath is a dictionary
#     if isinstance(tryxpath, dict):
#         assert True


#     # Example check if function returns a specific value for edge case
#     # ... (replace with appropriate edge case implementation)

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **No Python Code to Test:** The provided JavaScript code (`try_xpath_check_frame.js`) doesn't contain any Python functions.  Therefore, no direct `pytest` tests can be written *against* the JavaScript itself.

2. **Need a Python Wrapper:**  To test this JavaScript code, you'll need to create a Python wrapper that interacts with it (e.g., using `js2py`, `selenium`, or similar tools). This Python code would need to be used in a `pytest` test environment.

3. **Example `test_is_content_loaded` (IlluStartive):**  The commented-out example (`test_is_content_loaded`) shows how tests *might* be structured *if* `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` were a Python function.   You would adapt these examples to your specific Python wrapper.


4. **Error Handling:** JavaScript errors could be raised and caught differently in your Python wrapper. The example shows how a `TypeError` or `AttributeError` might be handled when `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` is used improperly.  The examples are generic; you'll need specifics about your JavaScript and Python wrapper.

5. **Edge Cases:**  Edge cases are crucial.  What happens if `tryxpath` is not defined?  What does `isContentLoaded` return if the content hasn't fully loaded?  Without more information about the JavaScript's purpose, precise edge-case tests are impossible.


6. **Fixtures:** Fixtures aren't needed in this case for the JavaScript example itself, but they would be vital if your Python wrapper (which *is* testable) used external dependencies or resources.


**To write proper tests, you absolutely need to provide the Python wrapper code that interacts with the JavaScript.**  This example shows the conceptual structure of tests but requires the real function implementations to be complete and usable in a test environment.
