# <algorithm>

1. **`set_project_root()`:**
   - Takes a tuple of marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
   - Starts from the directory of the current file (`__file__`).
   - Iterates through parent directories until it finds a directory containing any of the marker files.
   - If found, it sets `__root__` to that directory and breaks the loop.
   - Adds the root directory to `sys.path` if it's not already there.
   - Returns the root directory (`__root__`).


2. **Get Project Root:**
    - Calls `set_project_root()` to determine the project root directory.

3. **Load settings:**
   - Tries to open `src/settings.json` in the project root.
   - Parses the JSON content into the `settings` dictionary using `json.load()`.
   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in case the file doesn't exist or is corrupted.

4. **Load Documentation:**
   - Tries to open `src/README.MD` in the project root.
   - Reads the file content into the `doc_str` variable.
   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **Extract Project Information:**
   - Extracts project name, version, author, copyright, and a coffee link from the `settings` dictionary (or defaults if `settings` are missing).
   - Assigns values to variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc.


**Data flow:**

- The current script's path is used to locate the project root.
- The `gs` module (presumably in the `src` package) is used to access the project root.
- `settings.json` and `README.MD` are read in the root directory.
- Values from `settings.json` are extracted and assigned to variables.

**Example:**

If `pyproject.toml` exists in the `hypotez` directory one level above the `header.py` file, `__root__` will be set to the `hypotez` directory.

**Explanation of dependencies:**

- `sys`, `json`: Standard Python libraries for system interactions and JSON parsing.
- `packaging.version`: Used for handling and comparing software version numbers.
- `pathlib`: Provides objects representing filesystem paths.
- `gs`: A custom module (likely in `src/`) that provides information about the project's location (`gs.path.root`).  This module is a critical dependency for locating the necessary files.  Without `gs`, the script cannot find `settings.json` and `README.MD`.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, including the `sys.path` variable. Used here to add the project root directory to the Python path.
- `json`: For working with JSON data. Used to load settings from a JSON file.
- `packaging.version`: For working with software versions. Not directly used in the shown example, but often beneficial in package management.
- `pathlib`: For interacting with files and paths in a platform-independent way.
- `gs`: A module in the `src` package, likely part of the project's infrastructure. This module provides the `gs.path.root` object, which helps in locating the project's root directory.


**Classes:**

- No classes are defined in the provided code.


**Functions:**

- `set_project_root(marker_files)`:  Finds the project root directory.  Crucially, it dynamically modifies `sys.path`, making modules in the `src` directory accessible. This function is essential for the project's modular structure.  Arguments: `marker_files`.  Return type: `pathlib.Path`.


**Variables:**

- `__root__`:  Stores the project root directory, as determined by `set_project_root()`.
- `settings`: A dictionary holding project settings (loaded from `settings.json`).
- `doc_str`: Stores the content of the `README.MD` file.
- `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:  These variables store project information extracted from `settings.json` (or defaults if not found).


**Possible Errors/Improvements:**

- **Robustness:** The `try...except` blocks for reading `settings.json` and `README.MD` are good, but could be made more specific.  For example, `FileNotFoundError` is likely, but other errors might occur. Consider using `importlib.metadata` to find package metadata instead of manually searching for files. This would help to avoid having hardcoded file locations.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling to provide more informative messages when `settings.json` or `README.MD` cannot be read or parsed. Include the file paths to assist in debugging issues.
- **Version checking:** Use `packaging.version.parse` or a similar function to properly parse the version number if it isn't already in the correct format.


**Relationship with other parts of the project:**

- This file acts as an entry point for accessing project settings and documentation.  It depends on the `gs` module for locating the project root. Other parts of the project likely use the variables (`__project_name__`, etc.) defined here.


**Overall:** The code is well-structured and handles potential errors gracefully.  The use of `pathlib` is good practice, and the `set_project_root` function is a helpful utility that centralizes project path management. Consider using `importlib.metadata` for more robust package metadata retrieval if applicable.
