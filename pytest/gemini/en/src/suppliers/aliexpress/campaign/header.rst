**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy File Creation and Deletion:** The tests now create dummy `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files for testing purposes and crucially remove them. This avoids accidentally introducing side effects and ensures the test environment is clean after each test run.
   - The location of the files (`Path(__file__).parent / "pyproject.toml"`) is important. `__file__` refers to the location of the current test file.
2. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are improved to verify the type and expected path of the `root_dir`.
3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where marker files aren't found, or are in a parent directory, or there are multiple marker files.
4. **Correct Handling of `sys.path`:** While you should test that the root directory is added to `sys.path`, this code also now checks the directory exists in `sys.path` after running `set_project_root()`, but note that testing modification of the `sys.path` directly can be fragile. The primary focus should be on ensuring that `set_project_root` calculates the path correctly.
5. **Isolated Tests:** The tests are designed to be independent of each other and avoid creating unnecessary dependencies between them.
6. **Error Handling (Partial):** The original code had error handling.  This test suite does not cover that code since there's no valid input that could *cause* a FileNotFoundError or JSONDecodeError for `set_project_root()` in isolation; that logic is more appropriately tested in the `header.py` file using `pytest.raises` (as shown in the example, though the code provided does not have error handling).

**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

Remember to adjust the test setup and assertions based on the specifics of your code and the expected behavior.  The current tests are thorough for the `set_project_root` function, but it's possible that other aspects of the code in `header.py` will also need testing.
