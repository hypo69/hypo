**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition of a `try...except` block around `set_project_root` is essential.  If the project root isn't found (e.g., marker files are missing), a `FileNotFoundError` is raised and the script exits gracefully with an informative message.  Error handling is also added to the loading of `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  This prevents the script from crashing and provides informative messages to the user.
* **Explicit Empty Dictionaries/Strings:** Instead of `...` in the `try...except` blocks, the code now sets `settings` and `doc_str` to empty dictionaries/strings in the `except` block.  This is vital to prevent errors later in the script when attempting to access keys that might not exist.
* **File Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function. This is crucial for handling files that may contain characters outside the ASCII range. Without this, your script could encounter errors (e.g., UnicodeDecodeError).
* **Clearer Error Messages:** More informative error messages now tell the user exactly what went wrong and where to look.
* **`sys.exit(1)`:** Using `sys.exit(1)` after printing the error message gracefully ends the script with a non-zero exit code, indicating an error to any calling environment.  This is essential for error reporting outside the script's context.
* **Correct Copyright Key:** Corrected the key name from `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"` in the code.
* **Docstring Enhancements:** A more comprehensive docstring is added to clearly explain what the module does, where it can be used and what potential problems can arise (which is important for users).

This improved version is significantly more robust and user-friendly. It handles potential errors gracefully, providing helpful feedback to the user, and addresses potential problems arising from malformed or missing files. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you don't have it already: `pip install packaging`.
