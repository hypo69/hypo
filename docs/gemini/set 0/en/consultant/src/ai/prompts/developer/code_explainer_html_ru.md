# Changes Made

*   Added docstrings to the module and the `add_numbers` function using reStructuredText (RST) format, adhering to Sphinx standards.
*   Added type hints (`a: int`, `b: int`, `-> int`) to the `add_numbers` function for better code clarity and type safety.
*   Added input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are integers.  Crucial to prevent unexpected behavior, especially when using external libraries.
*   Error handling was improved using `logger.error` for better logging.  `try-except` blocks were used to catch any potential calculation errors and properly report issues.
*   The `return` statement after the `except` block was added, to re-raise the error for proper error handling.
*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for consistent error logging.
*   Improved comments and removed vague words like "get" and "do."  Specific terms like "validation" and "calculation" were used instead.
