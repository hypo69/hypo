```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hypothesis for Input Variations:** The code now uses `hypothesis` to generate various inputs for testing, making tests more comprehensive and covering different scenarios.  I added a `test_grab_page_none_id_product` as a concrete example.

2. **Mocking:**  Critically, I've mocked the `execute_locator` method, `id_product`, `description_short` and `name` methods. This is essential because the actual `Driver` object interactions are complex and time-consuming and difficult to fully control within a pytest test. This prevents your tests from making real web requests and thus greatly improves their speed.


3. **Asynchronous Operations:** The tests now use `asyncio.get_event_loop()` and `loop.run_until_complete()` to properly handle the asynchronous nature of the `grab_page` method and other functions, as these methods use `async def` which need to be run by an event loop.


4. **Exception Handling:** Added a test `test_grab_page_fetch_all_data_exception` to demonStarte the proper approach to testing exceptions raised within the `fetch_all_data` function.


5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The example tests are a starting point.  You need to create similar tests for `id_product`, `description_short`, `name`, and other methods called within `fetch_all_data`, covering various valid and invalid input cases.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Install `pytest`, `hypothesis`, and `unittest.mock` :
    ```bash
    pip install pytest hypothesis unittest.mock
    ```
2.  Save the test code (as `test_graber.py`, for example) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.
3.  Run the tests using pytest:
    ```bash
    pytest test_graber.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Mock Realistic Data:**  The mocked return values for functions like `id_product`, `name`, `description_short` should be realistic to cover more of the possible behaviours of the system, but don't necessarily need to be actual data, as long as they are valid inputs and outputs in the right format.
- **Error Scenarios:** Add tests specifically for various error scenarios that might occur within the different functions of the graber file.
- **Complex Data Structures:** If your functions deal with complex data structures, think carefully about how to represent them in the test data using `hypothesis` or other Startegies.

Remember to replace the placeholder tests and mocks with your actual tests that specifically cover the logic and the expected behavior of your code. These example tests serve as starting points to guide you. Remember to test each function individually (and their interactions).
