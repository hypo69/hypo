```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function and the `json.load` function.  This isolates the `get_project_root` function from external file dependencies, allowing us to test different scenarios without needing actual files.  This is vital for reliable testing.

* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary files and directories within the test environment. This avoids polluting the actual file system with test data.

* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The tests now cover `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the settings and README loading scenarios, ensuring robustness.

* **Clearer Test Names:**  The test names are more descriptive, improving readability.

* **Edge Cases:** Tests now explicitly check for cases where no marker files are found and cases where the root directory is provided directly.

* **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):**  Since we're using mocking, `pytest.raises` is not necessary for exception testing, as the `side_effect` of the mock object can simulate exceptions.


This revised solution addresses the critical issue of relying on external files and provides comprehensive tests for error handling and various input conditions. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.logger.header` with the actual path if it's not in the same directory as your test file.  This revised solution is significantly more robust and reliable. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
