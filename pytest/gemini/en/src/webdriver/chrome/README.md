```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`@pytest.fixture(scope="module")` for `chrome_driver_service`:** This is crucial.  It ensures that ChromeDriver is started only once for the entire test module, preventing multiple instances of ChromeDriver from being created for each test. This fixes memory leaks and saves resources.


2. **Robust Error Handling:** The tests now include `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during the execution of the `execute_cdp_cmd` calls. This helps to identify errors more effectively during testing.


3. **Specific Exception Assertions (`test_execute_cdp_cmd_invalid_url`)**: Instead of just checking for any exception, we now verify that the `Exception` message contains expected strings, increasing test reliability.


4. **`test_execute_cdp_cmd_nonexistent_command`:** This tests for handling a command that doesn't exist in the DevTools Protocol, a critical aspect of robustness.


5. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are now more specific.  Instead of just checking for `None`, we verify the `response['id']` and `response['result']` are not None. This improves the test's ability to catch subtle issues.


6. **Missing/Incomplete Code**: The example code only provided a simple example. The provided tests are now significantly more thorough and include important checks (like for an invalid URL) and critical error handling.

**Before running the tests:**

- **Install necessary libraries:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest selenium
  ```

- **Replace `/path/to/chromedriver`:** Change this to the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable on your system.


- **Run the tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest your_test_file.py
  ```

This revised solution provides a more comprehensive and robust set of tests that cover various scenarios, including error handling and edge cases. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual functionality of the code you want to test.
