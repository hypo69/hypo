# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.

# Example of a test file with no actual code to test
# This is a placeholder as the provided HTML file has no Python code
# You would replace this with tests for the actual Python functions.


# Example fixture (replace with actual fixture if needed)
@pytest.fixture
def example_data():
    """Provides test data for a hypothetical function."""
    return {"key": "value"}

# Example test (replace with tests for the actual functions)
def test_function_not_present(example_data):
    """
    This is an example test.  Replace with tests for the
    actual Python functions if any exist. This function
    currently passes because there is no function to test.
    """
    assert True
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) contains no Python code.  Therefore, there is nothing to test.  The example tests above are completely hypothetical and will pass because there is no function or class to verify.

**To create effective tests:**

1. **Identify the Python Code:**  The crucial first step is to locate the Python code related to the `popup.html` file.  The HTML file likely interacts with Python code to display content or handle user interactions.  **Find that Python code.**

2. **Analyze the Python Code:** Understand the logic of the Python code.  Determine the functions, methods, and classes to test.  Consider potential inputs, outputs, and error conditions.

3. **Design Test Cases:** Based on the analysis, create test functions that cover different scenarios:
   - **Valid Inputs:**  Ensure the code works correctly with expected data.
   - **Invalid/Unexpected Inputs:**  Test how the code handles incorrect or unexpected data.
   - **Edge Cases:**  Test the behavior near boundaries (e.g., maximum/minimum values, empty lists, etc.).
   - **Error Handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to check if the code raises exceptions when it should, and verify the type of exception raised.

4. **Implement Tests:** Write `pytest` test functions (as shown in the example) following best practices for clarity, structure, and isolation.

**Example (IlluStartive, needs actual Python code):**

```python
import pytest
import your_module  # Replace with the actual module

def test_get_greeting(your_module):
    assert your_module.get_greeting("David") == "Hello, David"
```

This example assumes a function `get_greeting` in a module named `your_module` that returns a greeting.  Replace placeholders with your actual function names and module names.  You should also include tests for error handling, edge cases, and any other aspects of the code that need verification.

**Key Takeaway:**  The provided HTML file is insufficient for test writing. You *must* identify the corresponding Python code. Without that, there is nothing to test. Remember to replace the example tests with tests tailored to the actual Python code you have.
