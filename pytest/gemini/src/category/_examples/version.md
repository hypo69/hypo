**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now accurately describe the attribute being tested.

2. **Attribute Type Checking:** Added checks to ensure the attributes have the expected data types (string, etc.).

3. **Missing Attribute Handling:** The code now includes assertions to check if the attributes exist before trying to access them.

4. **Specific Value Verification:**  The tests now check for the *exact* expected values of attributes.

5. **Comprehensive Attribute Coverage:** Tests cover `__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__author__`.

6. **Example Exception Handling (commented out):** Demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.  Uncomment and modify this section if your code raises exceptions.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as your `version.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_version.py` from your terminal.


**Crucially important:**  The code example in your `version.py`  doesn't have *functions* or *methods* to test, so the examples are focused entirely on attributes.  If your `version.py` contained *functions* (e.g., functions that calculate a version, validate a version, or other operations on versions), you would add test functions there to check their behavior. The template will work for these tests too. Remember to adjust the tests based on the logic in the `version.py` file.
