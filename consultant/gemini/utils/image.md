Image Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None:
        Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

Examples:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

**Changes and explanations:**

* **Error Handling (Crucial):** The most significant change is enhanced error handling.  The previous code swallowed exceptions.  Now, `try...except` blocks are added to catch `aiohttp.ClientError` (for network issues),  `FileNotFoundError`, and other potential exceptions during both downloading and saving.  This makes the code much more robust.  It logs the error and returns `None` to signal failure, instead of potentially crashing.  The critical fix was adding the `if not file_path.exists() or file_path.stat().st_size == 0:` check in `save_png` to handle cases where a file might be created but empty.

* **HTTP Error Handling:** The `response.raise_for_status()` call is added to `save_png_from_url`. This is vital; it will raise an exception for bad HTTP responses (like 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error), preventing silent failures.

* **Clearer Error Messages:** Error messages are more descriptive, helping with debugging.

* **Return `None` on Failure:** The functions now return `None` if any error occurs during the operation. This is a standard and more informative way to signal that the operation failed.

* **Concise Exception Handling:** The `except Exception as e:` block remains, but it is improved to at least log the problem and return `None`.

* **Removed redundant `image = Image.open(...)`**: The `Image.open` call is now done *after* the file has been written, this should be the correct order and avoids a potential error.



This revised code is far more reliable and user-friendly because it gracefully handles potential problems during the image download and save processes.  Always thoroughly test your error handling in a production environment! Remember to adjust the logging as needed for your application.
