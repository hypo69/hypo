How to use the `version.py` file in the `hypotez` project

This file, located at `hypotez/src/templates/version.py`, defines variables related to the project version, author, and other metadata.  It aims to load this information from a `settings.json` file, providing flexibility.

**Purpose**

The primary purpose of this file is to store project metadata like:

* `__project_name__`: The name of the project (defaults to "hypotez").
* `__version__`: The version number of the project (defaults to empty string).
* `__doc__`, `__details__`: Documentation strings (currently empty).
* `__author__`: The author of the project (defaults to empty string).
* `__copyright__`: Copyright information (defaults to empty string).
* `__cofee__`: A link to a platform for supporting the developer (defaults to a Boosty link).

**How to use it:**

1. **`settings.json`:**

   Create a `settings.json` file in the same directory as `version.py` (one level above):

   ```json
   {
       "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
       "version": "1.2.3",
       "author": "John Doe",
       "copyright": "Copyright 2023, My Awesome Company",
       "cofee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername"  
   }
   ```
   
   This file provides the project's specific metadata.  If any of these keys are missing, the defaults in `version.py` will be used.

2. **Import and Access:**

   In your other Python files, import the variables:

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.templates.version import __project_name__, __version__

   print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
   print(f"Version: {__version__}")
   ```


**Error Handling and Fallbacks**

The code includes a `try...except` block to handle potential issues:

* **`FileNotFoundError`:** If `settings.json` doesn't exist, the defaults will be used.
* **`json.JSONDecodeError`:** If `settings.json` has invalid JSON format, the defaults will be used.

This robust error handling prevents the script from crashing if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted.


**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Explanation:** Added a comprehensive explanation of the file's purpose and use.
* **Explicit Instructions:** Provided step-by-step instructions on how to use the file and create `settings.json`.
* **Error Handling Detail:** Highlighted the error handling to show how the script gracefully handles missing or invalid configuration files.
* **Example Usage:** Included a Python code snippet demonstrating how to import and use the variables.


This revised guide provides a complete, easy-to-understand explanation of how to leverage the `version.py` file effectively for project metadata management. Remember to adjust the paths and example data to match your specific project structure.
