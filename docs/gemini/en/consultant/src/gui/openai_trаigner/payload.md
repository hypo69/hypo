# Changes Made

*   Added import statements: `import json`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`, `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Added detailed docstrings (reStructuredText) to the `load_payload` function and the module.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
*   Implemented error handling using `logger.error` for better error reporting.
*   Corrected inconsistent variable naming (e.g., 'trаigner' to 'trainer').
*   Improved clarity and specificity in comments.
