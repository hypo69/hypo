**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `find_project_root` function now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if no suitable root directory is found, which is crucial for proper error handling.  Crucially,  it now *explicitly* checks if the directory exists.
* **Robust `settings.json` Handling:** The code now has much more robust error handling for loading and parsing `settings.json`.  It catches both `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, preventing the script from crashing if the file is missing or the JSON is invalid.  It also provides a fallback to the folder name if `project_name` isn't found in `settings.json`.
* **Explicit Path Existence Checks:** Checks are added to make sure the bin directories actually exist before adding them to `sys.path`. This prevents errors and unexpected behavior.
* **`gi` Library Warning Filtering:** The code specifically filters warnings from the `gi` library which is commonly used with GTK.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Improved error messages to aid in debugging.
* **Redundancy Removal:** Removed unnecessary `__root__` assignment inside the `try/except` block. The `__root__` value is already established and should be used instead.
* **Idiomatic Python:** Uses `any` for conciseness in finding the marker files.
* **Corrected Path Handling:** The code now correctly uses `Path` objects to manipulate paths, which is more robust to different operating system conventions.


**How to Use:**

1.  Ensure your project structure has `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git` (or other marker files) in the top-level project directory.
2.  Place this script in your project's `src/endpoints/emil` directory.
3.  This script should be imported in your other python modules and executed to run the scripts.

This revised script is more reliable and robust, handles errors gracefully, and is more aligned with Pythonic best practices. Remember to adjust the paths (`gtk_bin_path`, etc.) to match your actual project structure. Remember that setting `sys.path` this way will not affect imported modules that are already in memory.  For those, you would need to restart your application or re-import the modules in your new python process.
