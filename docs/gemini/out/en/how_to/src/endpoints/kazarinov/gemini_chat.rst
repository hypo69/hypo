How to use the KazarinovAI class for model training and dialog generation
=========================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a `KazarinovAI` class for interacting with the Google Generative AI (Gemini) model within the Kazarinov project.  It handles model initialization, training with data from specified files, question answering, and interactive dialog sessions.  The code utilizes functionalities from other modules within the project for file reading, logging, and handling credentials and paths.  Crucially, it implements chunking of large training data to avoid exceeding API request size limits.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
   - The `KazarinovAI` class is instantiated with optional `system_instruction` (for the model's system role) and `generation_config` (for content generation).
   - It initializes two instances of `GoogleGenerativeAI` (gemini_1 and gemini_2), sharing the API key and system instructions, but each using a different history file for potential distinct dialog contexts.


2. **Training (`train` method):**
   - Reads training data from files located in a specified directory, recursively handling subdirectories.
   - Splits the training data into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding API request size limitations.
   - Iterates through each chunk, sending it to the `gemini_1` model for processing.
   - Logs information about each chunk, potentially for monitoring and debugging.
   - (The example code in this step also has a commented-out section for saving the dialog data in JSON format to a file, for persisting interactions during training.)


3. **Question Answering (`question_answer` method):**
   - Reads questions from files in a specified directory.
   - Iterates through each question, sending it to the `gemini_1` model.
   - Prints the responses from the model.


4. **Dialog (`dialog` method):**
   - Reads questions from files in a specified directory.
   - Randomly shuffles the questions.
   - Prints questions and then gets responses from the `gemini_1` model, for each question.
   - Prints the response, and adds a delay for better user experience.


5. **Asking Questions (`ask` method):**
   - This method is used internally by other parts of the code, and sends questions to the Gemini model, optionally logging the interaction and whether pre-training should be applied.


6. **Chat Session (`chat` method):**
   - Reads system instructions from a text file.
   - Creates a `KazarinovAI` object using the instructions.
   - Enters a loop to get user input until the user types "exit".
   - If the user types "--next", it selects a random question from the question database and sends it to the AI model.


7. **Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**
   - Reads system instructions.
   - Creates an instance of the `KazarinovAI` class.
   - Calls the `train` method (training model)
   - Calls `dialog` method (starts a dialog interaction)


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.gemini_chat import KazarinovAI, chat
    import gs

    # ... (Set up your gs module for accessing credentials and paths.) ...

    # Initialize the AI object
    system_instruction = read_text_file(gs.path.google_drive / 'kazarinov' / 'prompts' / 'system_instruction.txt')
    k = KazarinovAI(system_instruction=system_instruction)

    # Start the chat session.
    chat()
