```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import PrestaShop

# Tests for PrestaShop class (assuming it's the core class)

def test_prestashop_mode():
    """Checks the MODE attribute is correctly assigned."""
    assert PrestaShop.MODE == 'dev'

def test_prestashop_import():
    """Checks the PrestaShop class can be imported successfully."""
    try:
        PrestaShop
        assert True
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Error importing PrestaShop: {e}"
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code snippet is very minimal, only defining a `MODE` variable and importing a `PrestaShop` class.  There are no methods or functions to test.  Therefore, the test cases are significantly simplified.  The original prompt lacks crucial information about the `PrestaShop` class's actual functionality. 

* **Missing Class Definition:**  The prompt needs the actual Python code for the `PrestaShop` class.
* **Functionality Unknown:**  Without knowing what `PrestaShop` does (e.g., retrieves data, performs calculations), it's impossible to write meaningful tests.
* **Testing `MODE`:**  The simplest test we can add is validating the `MODE` attribute.
* **Import Test:** Adding a test to verify the import is successful is essential for basic class integrity checks.

**Example with More Realistic Code (assuming a method):**

```python
# Placeholder for the PrestaShop class (Replace with your actual code)
class PrestaShop:
    

    def get_products(self, limit=10):
        """
        Retrieves a limited number of products.

        Args:
            limit: The maximum number of products to retrieve.

        Returns:
            A list of product dictionaries or None if an error occurs.
        """
        if limit <= 0:
            return None  # Error condition for invalid limit
        # Replace with your actual data retrieval logic.
        return [{'id': i} for i in range(limit)]

```

```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import PrestaShop


def test_get_products_valid_limit():
    """Test getting products with a valid limit."""
    ps = PrestaShop()
    products = ps.get_products(limit=5)
    assert products == [{'id': 0}, {'id': 1}, {'id': 2}, {'id': 3}, {'id': 4}]


def test_get_products_invalid_limit():
    """Test getting products with an invalid limit (less than 1)."""
    ps = PrestaShop()
    products = ps.get_products(limit=0)
    assert products is None


def test_get_products_large_limit():
    """Test getting products with a large limit."""
    ps = PrestaShop()
    products = ps.get_products(limit=20)
    assert len(products) == 20 # Ensure the correct number of products is returned.
```

**Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Replace the placeholder `PrestaShop` class** with your actual class definition from `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/__init__.py`.
2. **Add tests based on the methods** within the `PrestaShop` class.  Focus on the various input parameters and expected outputs for each method.
3. **Implement error handling:**  Use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling for invalid inputs to methods.
4. **Consider edge cases:**  For example, if a method interacts with external services, validate how the method handles failures or timeouts from those services.

This improved example demonStartes how to write tests based on a more realistic example of a class. Remember to adapt the test functions to accurately reflect the logic and behavior of your actual `PrestaShop` class. Provide the class code for more targeted and complete testing advice.
