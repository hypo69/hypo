**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hypothetical Function:** The provided code had no functions or classes, so I've created a hypothetical `calculate_total_cost` function.  Replace this with your actual code for testing.
2. **pytest.raises:**  Crucially, I've used `pytest.raises(ValueError)` to test for the `ValueError` exception raised by the hypothetical function. This is a critical aspect of testing for errors.
3. **Parameterization (`@pytest.mark.parametrize`):**  This is a powerful feature of `pytest` for testing multiple scenarios in a single function. This covers various valid inputs, an empty list, and the error case.  This approach is much more efficient than writing separate test functions for each case.
4. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** The test function names are more descriptive, and the docstrings explain the purpose of each test.
5. **Edge Cases:**  The `test_calculate_total_cost_empty_list` function now demonStartes a test specifically for an empty input list.



**How to Use This Example with Your Code:**

1. **Replace `calculate_total_cost`:**  Substitute your actual function or class.
2. **Modify test cases:**  Update the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` cases to match your function's input and expected output types. If your function returns something other than a number or None, or raises different exceptions, adjust the expectations accordingly.
3. **Add tests for other functions/methods:**  If your code has other functions, create new test functions to test each of them following the example approach.

**Example using the provided text:**  Testing for the document itself isn't possible because there are no functions or classes to test directly within the `input_code`.  Therefore, this response offers a demonStartion of a *generic* testing method that could be applied if you had a relevant Python function to test.


Remember to install pytest if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
