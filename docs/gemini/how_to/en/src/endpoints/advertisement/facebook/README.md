# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook`

This directory contains code for interacting with the Facebook Ads API.  This document outlines how to use these endpoints.

**Disclaimer:**  This is a placeholder.  Specific instructions and examples are missing.  To use the code, you'll need to fill in the details below.

**1. Prerequisites:**

* **Facebook Ads API Account:** You need a valid Facebook Ads API account and associated API credentials.
* **Python Libraries:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including `facebook-ads`.  You'll likely also need other libraries for data handling (e.g., `pandas`).
* **Authentication:**  Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms for accessing the Facebook Ads API.  This typically involves using an access token.

**2. Core Concepts:**

* **Endpoints:** This directory likely contains functions/classes interacting with various Facebook Ads API endpoints (e.g., `create_campaign`, `get_ad_performance`).  Each endpoint interacts with specific parts of the API.
* **Input Parameters:** Each endpoint expects specific input parameters, such as campaign details, targeting criteria, budget, and more. Review the docstrings and function parameters of each endpoint to understand the needed input.
* **Output Data:** Each endpoint returns specific data types representing the result of the Facebook API call.  The output format will depend on the API call.
* **Error Handling:**  Properly handle potential errors and exceptions during API interactions.  The API might return errors, like rate limits or invalid inputs.


**3. Usage Example (Placeholder):**

```python
from facebook_ads import FacebookAdsApi

# Replace with your actual API credentials and access token
api = FacebookAdsApi(access_token='YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN')


def create_campaign(api, campaign_details):
    # ... (implementation details) ...
    try:
        result = api.create_campaign(campaign_details)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating campaign: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
campaign_data = {
    'name': 'My Facebook Campaign',
    'objective': 'LINKEDIN_LEAD_GENERATION',
    'budget_daily': 10,
    # ... more campaign details
}

campaign_result = create_campaign(api, campaign_data)

if campaign_result:
    print("Campaign created successfully:", campaign_result)
```

**4. Key Considerations:**

* **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of Facebook's API rate limits to avoid interruptions in your program.
* **Error Management:**  Implement robust error handling to catch and manage issues with API requests.
* **Data Validation:** Validate input data to prevent errors when calling the API.
* **Authentication:**  Properly handle the refresh token management for continuous access to the API.


**Important:**  This README is a template.  Please replace the placeholder code and examples with the actual implementation details from the codebase.  Add specific instructions for each endpoint, including input parameter details, return values, and potential error scenarios. Provide documentation for the input structure and expected output.  Example calls to specific endpoints would be very helpful.
