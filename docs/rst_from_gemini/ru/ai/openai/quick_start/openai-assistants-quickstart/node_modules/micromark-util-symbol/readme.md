A micromark utility package containing symbol constants.

## Summary

This package exports constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.  These constants are primarily intended for use within custom micromark extensions. They improve code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to reference symbols by name instead of their numerical values.  The `micromark-build` package compiles these constants away in production code.

## Installation

This package is ESM only.

**Node.js (v16+)**

```bash
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

**Deno (with esm.sh)**

```typescript
import * as symbol from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol@latest';
```

**Browsers (with esm.sh)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as symbol from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol@latest?bundle';
</script>
```

Replace `@latest` with a specific version if needed.

## Usage

```javascript
import { codes, constants, types, values } from 'micromark-util-symbol';

console.log(codes.atSign); // Output: 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax); // Output: 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw); // Output: 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign); // Output: '@'
```


## API

This package exports the following identifiers:

*   `codes`: Maps string names to code point values.
*   `constants`: Maps string names to various constants.
*   `types`: Maps string names to type values.
*   `values`: Maps string names to character values.


## Types

This package is fully type-safe, utilizing TypeScript.  No additional type definitions are exported.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with `micromark@^3`.  It targets Node.js 16 and above.  Support for older Node.js versions may be dropped in future releases.


## Security

* **Installation Examples:**  Added explicit examples for various environments (Node.js, Deno, Browsers).  Using `@latest` encourages using the latest version.
* **API Details:** Added a brief description of each exported object.
* **Compatibility Clarification:** Added explicit compatibility information, particularly targeting Node.js versions.
* **Security and Contributing:** Improved links to the relevant documentation.
* **Readability:** Improved formatting and spacing for better readability.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary details (e.g., the "What is this?" section could be implied by the package name).


This revised README is significantly more user-friendly and provides a better introduction to the package's purpose and usage. Remember to update the link definitions (badges, etc.) to point to the correct locations.
