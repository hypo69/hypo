**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  The `mock_file_system` function now correctly creates mock directories and files, avoiding potential issues with real file system interactions during testing.  Critically, this means we don't rely on the existence of `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` in the test environment.

2. **Clearer Fixtures:** The fixtures now explicitly name the scenarios (e.g., `test_data_dir_no_marker`).

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Added tests for cases where marker files are:
   - In the current directory.
   - Not found (returns current directory).
   - Located in a subdirectory.
   - Invalid (marker file doesn't exist).

4. **Exception Handling:** Included a test using `pytest.raises` to verify that no exception is raised when the function finds the correct directory.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing `test_header.py`.


This improved solution addresses the previous limitations and provides a more robust and reliable test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/webdriver` with the actual path if needed.  The example uses `tmp_path` which is a fixture provided by pytest to create temporary test directories, making the tests more self-contained. `pytest.raises` is used to check for the absence of exception during successful function execution.
