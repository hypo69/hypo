**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` class and other parts of the code that are not easily testable directly. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing dependencies on external services or resources.


2. **`MockContext`:**  A mock `Context` is introduced to provide a substitute for the global `Context` object. This is essential for testing because the global `Context` makes tests tightly coupled.


3. **Clearer Test Cases:**  Test names are more descriptive (`test_graber_init`, `test_grab_page_valid_input`), making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.


4. **Exception Handling:** A `test_grab_page_exception` is included to verify that the `grab_page` function handles exceptions during data fetching gracefully.


5. **`test_other_methods_called`:**  This test verifies that the `id_product` and `name` functions (which are now mocked) are actually called within the `grab_page` function, ensuring that the necessary parts of the code are executed during the test.


6. **Mock Dependencies:**  The `@patch` decorator is used to mock functions like `id_product`, `name`,  etc., within the `Graber` class to avoid calling the actual implementation during testing, ensuring the tests are isolated.


7. **`test_name` Example:**  A complete example for testing a method like `name` is provided, demonStarting how to mock the method's execution to control the test's outcome.


**Key Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **Specific Method Tests:**  Create tests for each method (`id_product`, `name`, etc.) to verify their behavior with various inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases).
* **Input Validation:** Test the handling of `None` or empty values for the arguments passed to methods.
* **Error Handling:** Add more tests for exceptions that might be raised during the process of gathering product data. Use `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct exceptions are raised when needed.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Since the code is asynchronous, ensure you are using `asyncio.run` to run the asynchronous methods within your tests properly.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive set of test cases, addressing the key issues of the original example. Remember to adapt the mocks to match the actual implementations of the various methods in the `Graber` class. Also, install the `pytest` library if you haven't already. `pip install pytest`
