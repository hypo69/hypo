# ... other test functions for edge cases and invalid inputs as needed ...
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `settings.json`:** The solution now uses `pytest.fixture` to create a temporary `settings.json` file within each test. This is crucial for isolating the tests and preventing them from depending on the existence of a file in the project directory.  This is done via `tmp_path`.

2. **Multiple Fixtures for different scenarios:** The code defines `mock_settings_file` for valid data and `mock_empty_settings_file` for the case of an empty settings file. This allows you to test both cases.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_with_valid_settings`, `test_version_without_settings_file`).

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The code now covers the case of `settings.json` not existing.


5. **Error Handling:** It uses `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` appropriately, ensuring that the tests don't crash if the `settings.json` file is missing or has invalid data. It also checks for empty dictionary in `settings`.

6. **Import from `hypotez`:** The code now correctly imports from the assumed `hypotez` module.

7. **Import from `hypotez`:**  Critically, this solution now imports the variables (e.g. `__version__`) from `hypotez.src.version`. This is a critical step for testing the module as written, since the code inside the module is now actually being tested.

8. **Invalid JSON handling**: The tests now include a test case where the `settings.json` file has invalid JSON to verify that the program can handle this case gracefully and doesn't crash.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_version.py`


This improved solution provides a more robust and effective way to test the provided code. Remember to adapt the test cases to precisely match the expected behavior of your function or class.  Crucially, the solution now focuses on validating that the imported function is returning correct values given various inputs and error conditions, as opposed to simply checking the presence or absence of files.
