Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Raises exceptions for errors.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Raises exceptions for errors.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')  # Note: Replace with actual return value

    >>> data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...    print(data[:10]) # Print first 10 bytes
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling using `try...except` blocks.  Crucially, it catches `aiohttp.ClientError` for HTTP problems and `IOError` for file system issues.  This prevents silent failures.  It also provides more informative error messages.
* **Explicit Directory Creation:**  Instead of relying on `mkdir` on a potentially nonexistent parent, it explicitly creates the required parent directories using `save_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
* **Timeout:**  A crucial addition is a `timeout` parameter in the `session.get` call. This prevents the script from hanging indefinitely if the download takes too long or if the server is unresponsive.
* **Clearer Exception Types:**  `FileNotFoundError` is now raised if the file doesn't exist, and more specific exceptions are raised for other issues.
* **Function Documentation:** Enhanced the docstrings with `Raises` sections to clearly specify potential exceptions.
* **Realistic Example (main):** The `main` function is improved and illustrates correct usage.  It includes a more realistic example, and importantly, catches and handles exceptions to prevent your application from crashing.  It's now using a publicly available image URL to show how it would work in practice.

**How to use:**

1.  **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install aiohttp aiofiles
    ```

2.  **Replace placeholders:** Update the `url` and `save_path` variables in the `main` function with your actual video URL and desired save path.

3.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

This revised solution is significantly more robust and reliable for handling potential issues during the download and file saving process, making it suitable for production environments. Remember to replace `"https://example.com/video.mp4"` with a valid URL.  Also, make sure the `src.logger` module is correctly configured for your logging needs.
