# README for micromark-util-types

This package provides TypeScript types used throughout the micromark ecosystem.  It's crucial for creating typed extensions for micromark parsers.

## Purpose

This package exposes a standardized set of TypeScript types for micromark, helping developers create extensions that are both functional and type-safe.  It avoids redundant type definitions across different micromark packages.

## Usage

To use the types, install the package:

```bash
npm install micromark-util-types
```

or for Deno using `esm.sh`:

```javascript
import type { Point, /* other types */ } from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-types@latest';
```

Import specific types as needed within your code:

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {import('micromark-util-types').Point} Point
 */

// ... your code using the Point type ...
```


## Key Concepts

* **Type Safety:**  Reduces the likelihood of errors by ensuring your code interacts with micromark data structures in the expected way.
* **Consistency:**  Provides a consistent type definition across different micromark components.
* **Extensibility:**  Allows developers to build extensions with type safety without needing to define every type from scratch.

## Documentation

The complete API documentation for the types is available within the `index.d.ts` file.  You can find this within the project's repository.

## Compatibility

This package is designed to work with `micromark@^3`.  Be sure to consult the release notes of the `micromark-util-types` package for specific compatibility information.
