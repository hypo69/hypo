**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` (Exception Handling):**  Added tests that specifically check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.  This is crucial for robustness. Example:  We've not added the tests to the `from src import gs` parts as the `gs` object is imported elsewhere and mocking or testing it here wouldn't be appropriate.

2. **Mocking:**  Instead of relying on actual files, fixtures like `project_root_mock` and `no_project_root_mock` create temporary directories with or without marker files. This improves test isolation and makes the tests faster.

3. **Clearer Test Names:**  Improved test names for better readability and to reflect the specific input or scenario being tested.

4. **Fixture Usage:** Introduced a fixture (`project_root_mock`) to make the `set_project_root` test creation more straightforward.

5. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Used `tmp_path` from pytest for creating temporary directories, avoiding issues with real file systems and ensuring test isolation.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added a test that checks the function when the directory is deep (nested subdirectories).

7. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**  Added tests for cases where the file system is not well-structured in a real-world scenario (like the case of a missing `pyproject.toml`).

8. **`sys.path` Modification:** A test is included to verify that the function adds the correct path to the `sys.path` list.

9. **Important Considerations:** The tests now focus on validating if the function correctly finds and returns the project root directory.  They do *not* verify the subsequent code using `__root__` (like opening the settings.json file). This is because, those tests should be in the module that imports and uses this function. These tests are specific to the function `set_project_root`.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


Remember to adapt these tests if the underlying code changes, especially if the `gs` module or related functions are modified.
