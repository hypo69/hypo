```

## <algorithm>

The algorithm is quite straightforward.

1. **Get File Path:** The current file's absolute path is obtained using `Path(__file__).resolve()`.
2. **Call Relative Path Function:** The `get_relative_path` function from the `src.utils.path` module is called, passing the absolute path of the current file and the target directory ('hypotez') as arguments.
3. **Calculate Relative Path:** The `get_relative_path` function computes the relative path from the current file to the target directory.
4. **Print Result:** The calculated relative path is printed to the console.

**Example:**

If `__file__` resolves to `/path/to/hypotez/src/utils/_examples/get_relative_path.py`, and the target directory is `/path/to/hypotez`, the output would be a relative path like `../`.

**Dependencies Analysis:**

The mermaid diagram shows a straightforward call flow.  The `get_relative_path` function is imported from the `src.utils.path` module. `Path` is imported from the standard library `pathlib`.  There's also an `import header`, but without further context, we cannot analyze its role or dependencies within the broader project.


## <explanation>

### Imports:

- `from pathlib import Path`: Imports the `Path` object from the `pathlib` module, which is part of the Python standard library.  This allows working with file paths in an object-oriented way.  This import is crucial for handling file system paths correctly.

- `import header`: Imports the `header` module.  Without seeing the contents of the `header` module, its purpose and dependencies are unknown. It's possible this module provides configuration settings, imports, or utility functions required by the project.  We need more context about the project structure to fully understand its role.

- `from src.utils.path import get_relative_path`: Imports the `get_relative_path` function from the `src.utils.path` module.  This implies a modular structure where utility functions for path manipulation are located in `src.utils.path`.  The function is likely part of a larger set of utilities for path-related operations within the `hypotez` project.


### Functions:

- `get_relative_path(current_path, target_path)`: This function, imported from `src.utils.path`, calculates and returns the relative path from `current_path` to `target_path`.  Without the implementation, we can't be precise about the algorithm used, but it will likely use the `Path` objects' functionality.

    * **Arguments:**
        * `current_path (Path)`: The absolute path of the current file.
        * `target_path (str)`: The target path (e.g., a directory name) as a string.

    * **Return Value:**
        * `(Path)`: The relative path to `target_path` from `current_path`.


### Variables:

- ``: This variable stores a string value likely representing the application mode ('dev', 'prod', etc.).

- `relative_path`: Stores the calculated relative path from the current file to the `hypotez` directory.


### Potential Errors and Improvements:

- **Missing error handling:** The code lacks error handling. If `get_relative_path` raises an exception, or if `target_path` does not exist, the script will crash. Consider adding `try-except` blocks to handle potential exceptions.
- **`header` module dependency:** The purpose of the `header` module is unclear from this code segment, making it difficult to assess whether its usage is optimal or if there are potential dependencies or issues concerning the module.


### Project Relationships:

The code clearly demonStartes a relationship with the `src.utils.path` module, which provides path manipulation utilities.  Further investigation of the `header` module and the broader `hypotez` project structure is needed to understand its full context and other interactions.  The `pathlib` module, being part of the Python standard library, is a dependency of this code but does not indicate a strong relationship between the application itself and `pathlib`.
