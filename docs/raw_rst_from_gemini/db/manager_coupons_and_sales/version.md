"""
This module defines the version information for the 'manager_coupons_and_sales' module.
It contains the version number, name, documentation, details, annotations, and author information.

- `__version__`: The version string of the module.
- `__name__`:  Name of the module (usually the filename without the extension).
- `__doc__`: Docstring describing the module.
- `__details__`: Additional details or metadata about the module version.
- `__annotations__`:  Type hints (annotations) for variables and functions (currently empty).
- `__author__`: The author of the module.
"""
__name__ = "version"  # Corrected, __name__ should be the module's name
__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"
__doc__ = "Version information for the manager_coupons_and_sales module."
__details__ = "Details about version for manager_coupons_and_sales module."
__annotations__ = {} # Empty dictionary for type annotations

__author__ = 'hypotez'
```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **`__name__` Correction:** The `__name__` variable should be set to the name of the module, which in this case is likely "version".  Setting it to an empty string (`__name__ = ''`) is incorrect and misleading.

* **`__doc__` Improvement:**  The docstring (`__doc__`) is now more informative, explaining the module's purpose.

* **Type Hinting (`__annotations__`):**  The `__annotations__` variable is now an empty dictionary, which is the correct way to store type annotations if any.

* **Module Clarity:** The docstring clearly describes the purpose and usage of each variable within the module.

* **PEP 8 Compliance (Spacing and Naming):** The code now follows Python's style guide (PEP 8) for better readability.

**How to Use (Example):**

```python
import sys
from hypotez.src.db.manager_coupons_and_sales import version

print(f"Module version: {version.__version__}")
print(f"Module author: {version.__author__}")
```

This improved version is more consistent with Python best practices and provides a better understanding of the module's role.  Remember to ensure the file path is correct when importing.  Also consider using a `setup.py` file with `setuptools` if this is part of a package to properly manage the version across different projects and installations.
