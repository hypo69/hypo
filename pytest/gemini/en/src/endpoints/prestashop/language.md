# Example tests for other methods (add_language_PrestaShop, etc.)
# These tests will need the actual PrestaShop API mocked or stubbed
# to prevent external calls.  Here's an example using a mock:

def test_add_language_PrestaShop_valid(mocker, credentials):
  """Tests add_language_PrestaShop with valid input."""
  # Mock the PrestaShop API call
  mocked_api = mocker.patch('hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.PrestaShop.post', return_value={'status': 'success'})
  presta_language = PrestaLanguage(credentials=credentials)
  presta_language.add_language_PrestaShop('English', 'en')
  mocked_api.assert_called_once()


# More tests for other methods should be added based on their functionality
# and using the appropriate mocking mechanism (e.g., mocker.patch).
# Replace the placeholder with actual test logic.

# Example for testing exception handling in the __init__ method:
# def test_presta_language_init_invalid_credentials(mocker):
#     """Tests handling of invalid credentials in __init__."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
#         PrestaLanguage(credentials=42)  # Invalid credential type
#     assert "credentials must be a dict or SimpleNamespace" in str(excinfo.value)

# Remember to replace the placeholder comments in these example tests 
# with the actual code for the corresponding function.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial missing piece in the original response was mocking the `PrestaShop` API calls.  The `test_add_language_PrestaShop_valid` example now shows how to mock the `post` method (or any other API call) to isolate your tests and avoid actually communicating with the PrestaShop API.  **This is essential for proper unit testing!**

2. **Clearer Error Matching:** The `pytest.raises` statements now include regular expressions (`match`) to check for specific error messages, making the tests more robust.

3. **Comprehensive `__init__` Tests:**  The `__init__` method now has tests for various conditions including valid credentials, `None` credentials, missing `api_domain`, and missing `api_key`, correctly covering both valid and invalid scenarios.

4. **Fixtures:** The code now includes a `credentials` fixture, making it easier to use the same credentials across multiple tests.

5. **Example for other methods:**  The placeholder for `add_language_PrestaShop` is now an example of how to structure a test for it. You'll need to do this for all the other methods and mock the necessary parts of the `PrestaShop` class in your tests.

**How to run the tests:**

Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_language.py`) in the same directory as your `language.py` file, and then run `pytest test_language.py` from your terminal.  Pytest will discover and execute the test functions.


**Important Considerations:**

* **PrestaShop API Mocking:** You'll need to replace the placeholder `mocked_api` with the appropriate mocked call. Research how to mock the `PrestaShop` API's methods using `pytest-mock`.
* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the necessary modules (`gs`, `pprint`, `header`, etc.) and their dependencies are correctly installed for the test to work.
* **Error Handling:** Add tests for error handling and edge cases in the `add_language_PrestaShop` and other methods.
* **`PrestaShopException`:** If your `PrestaShopException` contains specific error types or messages, use `pytest.raises` with appropriate error type and message to check its proper usage.  


This revised answer provides a significantly improved starting point for your test suite. Remember to thoroughly test all methods, including their error handling and interactions with the external `PrestaShop` API. Remember to replace the placeholders with actual code logic for the missing methods.
