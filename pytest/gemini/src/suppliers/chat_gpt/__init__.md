**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `GptGs`:** The provided code only imports `GptGs`, but doesn't define it.  A `MockGptGs` class is created. This is CRUCIAL for testing.  You must mock out any external dependencies (like database calls, external APIs, etc.) to isolate your test.  This example shows how to mock the function call and return a result.  Adapt this to your specific `GptGs` implementation.


2. **`test_mode_is_set`:** Checks that the global `MODE` variable is correctly defined and has the expected value.


3. **`test_gptgs_do_something`:**  Tests the `do_something` method (replace `do_something` with the actual method name) with a mock object.  This example shows an *expected* result.


4. **`test_gptgs_do_something_raises_exception`:** Demonstrates testing for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.


5. **Missing scenarios:** The example tests are very basic.  You *must* add tests for specific use cases you expect in your code based on the input in `GptGs` or similar methods.  If you have requirements on how many times this method can be called, etc. Include those tests now.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace the `MockGptGs` with the actual `GptGs` class import.**


2.  **Adapt the test methods to the specific functions/methods** of `GptGs` (or classes imported from `hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt`).


3.  **Add test cases for different inputs, exception handling, and edge cases.**  Don't just test valid inputs; test invalid inputs to `do_something` (if applicable), boundary values, and empty inputs.


4.  **Run the tests:**  Install pytest (`pip install pytest`) and run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.


**Example with a more realistic mock, if you had a method that took input**:

```python
def test_gptgs_do_something_with_input():
    class MockGptGs:
        def do_something(self, input_data):
            return f"Processing: {input_data}"

    gpt_gs = MockGptGs()
    result = gpt_gs.do_something("Hello, world!")
    assert result == "Processing: Hello, world!"

```
