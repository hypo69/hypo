```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test is present in the HTML file.  Therefore, no tests can be written.

# Example of a test that would be appropriate if a Python file contained functions to interact with the HTML:
#
# def test_page_content(some_function_that_loads_page):
#     """Checks if the page contains the expected text."""
#     page_content = some_function_that_loads_page()
#     assert "<h1>Hypotez</h1>" in page_content
#     assert "<p>Привет, Это Давидка. Я обучаю модель</p>" in page_content
#
#     # Example of testing for specific element, using a library like Beautiful Soup:
#     # from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#     # soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, 'html.parser')
#     # h1_element = soup.find('h1')
#     # assert h1_element.text == "Hypotez"

#  Important:  To write meaningful tests, you need Python code that interacts with this HTML,
#  for example, code to fetch and parse the HTML content.  The provided HTML itself does not contain
#  any Python code.  Please provide the Python code that uses or interacts with this HTML to
#  generate test cases.
