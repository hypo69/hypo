```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Moved import statements to the top for clarity and organization.

2. **Clearer Test Function Names:** Improved test function names to clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

3. **Using `Path` Correctly:**  The code now uses `Path` objects consistently to work with file paths.

4. **Temporary Directory Creation:**  Crucially, the tests now create temporary directories and files for testing, ensuring they don't interfere with or affect the real project structure, making the tests self-contained and reliable.


5. **Cleanup:** Added `shutil.rmtree()` to remove temporary directories after each test run to prevent file system clutter.  This is essential for repeatable tests.


6. **Comprehensive Testing:** Added tests for:
   - Valid paths containing marker files.
   - Paths where no marker files are found.
   - Paths where the marker file is in the parent directory.
   - Cases with multiple marker files.

7. **Robustness:** Added handling for potential `FileNotFoundError` if the marker file is not found in the expected location (previously missing).


This revised solution is more robust, self-contained, and avoids potential issues from running tests in the presence of a real project directory. This is best practice in test development. Remember to run `pytest` from the root directory of your project to execute these tests.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Ensure the `hypotez` project structure (including `src/endpoints/kazarinov/react/header.py` and other files mentioned in the code) is setup correctly.
3.  Run `pytest` from your terminal in the project's root directory. `pytest test_header.py` or `pytest` will run all test files.
