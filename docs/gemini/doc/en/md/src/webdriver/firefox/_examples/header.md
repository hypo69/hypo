# hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_examples/header.py

## Overview

This module, located within the `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_examples` directory, appears to be a header file for a Python project. It contains several multiline strings, likely documenting various aspects of the project or defining constants.  The script also performs operations related to setting the project root directory in the system path.

## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string constant likely defining the current mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

**Value**: 'dev'


## Functions

### `__root__`

**Description**: This function calculates and returns the root path of the project.

**Returns**:
- `Path`: The absolute path to the project root.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`: if the project root directory is not found in the current path.




## Code Structure


The script imports `sys`, `os` and `Path` from the `pathlib` module.  These are likely used to interact with the file system,  manipulate paths and add the project root directory to the system path.

## Usage Example


```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# ... (rest of your code)

# Example demonstrating the use of __root__
project_root = __root__
print(f"Project root: {project_root}")

# ... (rest of your code)
```
