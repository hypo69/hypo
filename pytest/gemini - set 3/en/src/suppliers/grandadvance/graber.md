**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `save_png` and `execute_locator`, which is crucial for isolating the tests and avoiding external dependencies.
2. **Exception Handling Tests:**  Added tests specifically checking the exception handling for `local_saved_image` to ensure errors are caught and appropriate messages logged.
3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more precisely describe the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_local_saved_image_success`).
4. **`pytest.mark.asyncio`:** The decorator `@pytest.mark.asyncio` is added to ensure that the test functions are executed using an asyncio event loop. This is critical for async functions.
5. **Mock Driver:** A `MockDriver` fixture is created to mock the webdriver interactions, making tests more reliable.
6. **Example Test for Exception:** Includes a test case for a function that might raise `ExecuteLocatorException` for comprehensive exception handling testing.
7. **Fixture `product_fields`:** Added a fixture to provide a `ProductFields` object to the `test_local_saved_image_success` test. This makes it easier to set up the testing environment.
8. **Missing Tests:** Placeholder comments  `# ... (similar tests for other functions)`  are added as a reminder to add similar test cases for other functions (like `id_product`).

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as `test_graber.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/graber.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`


**Important Considerations:**

*   **`Context`:**  The tests need to properly mock the `Context` object and its attributes (e.g., `Context.locator`, `Context.driver`) if they are used inside the `Graber` class.
*   **External Dependencies:** If your code interacts with external services (e.g., file system, databases), you'll need to mock them as well to isolate the tests.  The `save_png` is now mocked.
*   **Asynchronous Functions:** All tests involving asynchronous functions (like `grab_page`) should use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and the appropriate `await` calls.


Remember to adjust the tests based on the specific functionality of the other functions.  The important part is to isolate and mock dependencies to test each method thoroughly.
