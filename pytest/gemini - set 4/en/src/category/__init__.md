**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The code now uses `pytest.raises` to check for `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions, making the tests more robust.  The error messages are also asserted to verify the specific exception reason.

2. **Clear Test Function Names:** Function names now clearly indicate the purpose of the test, making the test suite easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:**  Added tests for edge cases (e.g., very long names) and invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings, incorrect types).

4. **Comprehensive Tests for `Category`:** The test cases demonStarte the crucial steps of creating `Category` instances, verifying attribute values, equality checks, and handling potential errors.

5. **Testing `MODE`:** Added a test for the `MODE` global variable to ensure it's defined and has the expected string value.  Crucially, it tests for *missing variables* using `NameError`, making it more reliable.

6. **Type Checking (Important):** Checks the type of the `MODE` variable using `isinstance` to ensure the code is not unexpectedly assigning an inappropriate value.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_category.py`).
2.  Make sure `pytest` is installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_category.py` (or the appropriate test file name).

**Crucially Important:**

Replace the placeholder comments in the test functions (e.g., `# Replace with actual code if Category class is defined...`) with the actual code for your `Category` class.  Then, these tests will effectively test *your* `Category` class.  The example provided above is sufficient to test the cases for which the user has given the code, but may not be sufficient to test the *complete* function. Add tests as needed based on the specific behavior of your `Category` class and the requirements of your program.
