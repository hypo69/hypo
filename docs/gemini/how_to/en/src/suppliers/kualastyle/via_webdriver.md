How to use the `get_list_products_in_category` function in `hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/via_webdriver.py`

This function retrieves a list of product URLs from a category page on a website, using Selenium WebDriver.

**Function Signature:**

```python
def get_list_products_in_category(s) -> list[str, str, None]:
```

**Parameters:**

* **`s`**: An object representing the supplier.  Crucially, this object must have attributes `driver` (a Selenium WebDriver instance) and `locators` (a dictionary containing locators for elements on the webpage).  The `locators` dictionary in particular, is key to the function's operation.  It must contain a key 'category' pointing to a further dictionary containing elements such as 'product_links'.  Without the correct `s` object with these attributes and the proper locators defined, the function will fail.


**Return Value:**

* A list of product URLs (strings), or `None` if there's an error.  The return value is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a product URL, a string, and `None`.  This format is not very useful and likely indicates a type error in the function's implementation.  The function should either return a list of URLs (`list[str]`) or a list of tuples in a more structured format.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from src.suppliers.kualastyle.via_webdriver import get_list_products_in_category
# ... (your code to create the 's' object and set up the WebDriver) ...

supplier_object = ... # Your supplier object with driver and locators

try:
    product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier_object)
    if product_urls:
        for url in product_urls:
            print(url)
    else:
        print("No product URLs found or an error occurred.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

**Explanation and Key Points:**

1. **Supplier Object (`s`):**  The function relies heavily on the structure of the `s` object. It must contain the WebDriver (`s.driver`) and the locators (`s.locators['category']`).  This object encapsulates the supplier-specific details and actions, which are critical for interacting with the website's page.

2. **Locators (`s.locators`):**  The `s.locators['category']['product_links']` dictionary likely holds selectors (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath expressions) for the web elements containing the product links.  These locators must be correct to identify the intended elements. If these locators are incorrect, the function will likely return an empty list.

3. **Error Handling (Important):** The provided example now includes a `try...except` block.  This is essential because errors (like network issues or incorrect locators) can occur while interacting with the browser.  Adding error handling makes the code more robust.

4. **`execute_locator` (Potential Issue):** The line `_ = d.execute_locator` is not standard. WebDriver typically uses methods like `find_element` or `find_elements` to locate elements. This suggests a potential implementation error that needs to be fixed.  You should examine the method `execute_locator` (or `execute_script`, which `execute_locator` might be a custom wrapper for) to ensure it is the correct way of identifying product links.

5. **Type Hinting Improvement:** The return type hint `list[str,str,None]` is incorrect. If the function intends to return a list of URLs, it should be `list[str]`, or if the function is returning a list of tuples, a more descriptive return type is necessary.

**Debugging Tips:**

* **Print Statements:** Add `print()` statements to inspect the values of `s.driver`, `s.locators`, and the elements returned by `list_products_in_category` during debugging.
* **WebDriver Debugging:** Use your browser's developer tools (or a dedicated Selenium IDE) to inspect the elements on the webpage and ensure the locators (`s.locators['category']['product_links']`) accurately target the product links.
* **Verify `s` Object:** Check that `s` is correctly initialized with the necessary attributes and correct locator information.
* **Locator Correctness:** Double-check that `s.locators['category']['product_links']` points to the correct selectors for the product URLs on the page.  Test the locators outside the function to ensure they are working as intended.


By implementing these improvements, you'll have a more robust and usable function that reliably extracts product URLs. Remember to adjust the code snippets to fit your actual implementation.
