## Usage Guide for `get_product_id.py`

This module provides a function to extract product IDs from various input strings. It leverages the `extract_prod_ids` function from `src.suppliers.aliexpress.utils.extract_product_id`.

**File:** `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/tools/get_product_id.py`

**Function:** `get_product_id(raw_product_id: str) -> str`

**Purpose:** Extracts the product ID from a given input string.

**Parameters:**

*   `raw_product_id`: A string potentially containing the product ID.  This string *might* contain the product ID in multiple formats.  The function now *relies* on `extract_prod_ids` to handle these different formats.

**Return Value:**

*   A string representing the extracted product ID.

**Raises:**

*   `ProductIdNotFoundException`: If no valid product ID is found in the input string.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Import the function:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.tools.get_product_id import get_product_id
```

2.  **Provide the input string:**

```python
raw_product_id = "This is the product's detail page, with product id 1234567."
```

3.  **Call the function:**

```python
try:
    product_id = get_product_id(raw_product_id)
    print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
except ProductIdNotFoundException as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Example Usage (with possible error):**

```python
raw_product_id_valid = "product-12345"
raw_product_id_invalid = "This string contains no product id."

try:
  product_id = get_product_id(raw_product_id_valid)
  print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
except ProductIdNotFoundException as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
  product_id = get_product_id(raw_product_id_invalid)
  print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
except ProductIdNotFoundException as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Explanation of the Changes and Improvements:**

*   The code now relies entirely on the `extract_prod_ids` function.  This is a crucial improvement.  The original regex-based approach was brittle and likely not robust enough to handle various product ID formats. Using `extract_prod_ids` means that the logic for parsing different formats is encapsulated in a separate function, making the code more maintainable and extensible.  Crucially, this relies on `extract_prod_ids` being correctly implemented and robust in handling various formats.


**Key Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is essential for handling cases where a product ID is not found, preventing your program from crashing.
*   **Input Validation:** Consider adding input validation to `get_product_id` to check for invalid input types (e.g., if `raw_product_id` isn't a string).
*   **`extract_prod_ids` Implementation:** The success of this function hinges entirely on the quality of the `extract_prod_ids` implementation.  Make sure it is well-tested and handles various product ID formats comprehensively.


**Further Development:**

*   **Documentation:** Provide more detailed documentation for the `extract_prod_ids` function, including examples of different input formats it can handle.
*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure that `get_product_id` works correctly for various input strings containing different formats of product IDs.
