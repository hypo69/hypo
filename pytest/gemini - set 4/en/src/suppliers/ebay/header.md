```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to mock `sys.path` for more comprehensive testing of the `set_project_root` function.

2. **Edge Cases:** Tests now cover cases where no marker files are found and multiple marker files are provided.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test obvious.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Used for testing `FileNotFoundError` when `settings.json` doesn't exist.

5. **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Crucially, `tmp_path` is used to create a temporary directory for testing. This is far better than using absolute paths, as it ensures tests run independently, and eliminates the risk of collisions with existing files.

6. **File System Setup:** The `mock_file_system` fixture now creates a complete mock directory structure (including `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`,  `settings.json`, and `README.MD`) within the temporary directory, making tests much more robust and reliable.

7. **Comprehensive Testing:**  Tests now cover cases for a successful load, missing file, and correctly handling `sys.path`.

8. **Correct Exception Handling:** The tests for `settings_loading_failure` now use `pytest.raises` to ensure that the correct exception (FileNotFoundError) is caught.


This improved solution is far more robust and provides a much more effective set of tests, ensuring that the code functions correctly in various scenarios. Remember to install the necessary packages (`pytest`, `packaging` etc.) before running the tests.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
