**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to catch and log exceptions during credential retrieval, file upload, and folder lookup.  This is crucial for robust code.  Critically, the `upload_file` function now `raise`s an exception if the credentials aren't available.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Improved error messages to provide more context and help in debugging.
* **`_get_folder_id` Function:** Created a dedicated function to retrieve the folder ID.  This enhances code organization and readability.  **Crucially**, it now searches for the folder by name and checks if the folder exists;  it returns `None` if the folder isn't found.  This prevents the program from crashing.
* **File Path Handling:** Uses `Path` objects for consistent file path handling.
* **`SCOPES` as Class Variable:**  The `SCOPES` variable is now a class variable. This is better practice than having it defined locally within `_create_credentials`.
* **Credential File Existence Check:** Added a crucial check to ensure that the credentials file (`hypo69-c32c8736ca62.json`) exists before trying to use it.
* **Import `MediaFileUpload`:**  Added the necessary import (`MediaFileUpload`) for uploading files.
* **Main Function Example:** The `main` function now has an example usage (with error handling) that demonstrates how to use the `GoogleDriveHandler` class.


**Before Running:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Replace Placeholders:**
   - Update `'/mnt/data/google_extracted/sample_file.txt'` with the actual path to your file.
   - Update `'My Drive Folder'` with the name of the folder in your Google Drive.
   - Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the path of the file you want to upload.
3. **Configure Credentials:** Ensure you have a valid service account key file (`hypo69-c32c8736ca62.json`) in the `secrets` directory,  as indicated in the `gs.path.secrets` variable. This file needs to have appropriate permissions for Drive access.  This is the **most important** step.

This revised code is significantly more robust and user-friendly.  Remember to handle potential errors in your application logic! Always check for valid responses from Google APIs.
