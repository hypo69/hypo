**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the input type and expected behavior.
* **Parametrization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used to efficiently test various inputs.  This is crucial for testing functions that take different inputs, reducing repetitive test code.  Note how different types of invalid input are tested.
* **Edge Case Testing:**  The tests now include empty strings and `None` for input validation.
* **Comprehensive Exception Handling:**  Tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for the expected `TypeError` when invalid input is provided to the `gs` function. This is critical for robust error handling.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings are improved to clearly explain the purpose and logic of each test.
* **Comments:** Comments are added to explain the structure of the test cases.
* **Removed Unnecessary Code:** The example fixture and test using it are removed as they are not relevant to the provided code.


This improved test suite provides better coverage and ensures that the `gs` function works correctly under different conditions, especially when unexpected or invalid input is given.  It also follows good `pytest` practices for organization and readability. Remember to adapt the test cases to any specific error handling or expected behavior of the functions you're testing. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.credentials` with the actual module path if needed.
