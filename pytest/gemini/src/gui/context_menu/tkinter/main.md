**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs` and `header`:**  The code now uses a `MockGS` class to mock the `gs` module, which is crucial for testing functions that rely on external dependencies without actual file system interaction.  This makes the tests more robust and avoids issues related to file system operations during testing.
* **Temporary Files:** The `temp_script_path` fixture now uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` to create a temporary Python file for testing purposes. This ensures that test files are automatically deleted after each test, avoiding potential conflicts or leftover files.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_add_context_menu_item_invalid_script` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected error (SystemExit) when the script file does not exist, demonstrating proper error handling. This provides a more comprehensive test suite.
* **Registry Access:** Tests now use `try...except FileNotFoundError` blocks to gracefully handle the case where the registry key might not exist.
* **`root.withdraw()` and `root.destroy()`:** Added  `root.withdraw()` to hide the main GUI window during testing. And `root.destroy()` to release resources. This is very important for pytest to run smoothly without blocking the main thread.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately apparent.
* **Cleanup:** The `temp_script_path` fixture includes cleanup to remove the temporary file created for the test, which is crucial to prevent test failures due to resource leaks.
* **`pytest.fail`:**  Now correctly uses `pytest.fail()` to indicate the registry key wasn't created, rather than just returning.


This revised solution addresses the issues with previous responses, providing a more robust and reliable set of tests that can verify the functionality of the code in a more thorough manner. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Also, make sure to run the tests from a directory where `hypotez/src` is accessible to the Python interpreter.
