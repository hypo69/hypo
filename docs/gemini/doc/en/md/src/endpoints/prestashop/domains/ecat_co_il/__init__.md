# Module: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/ecat_co_il/__init__.py

## Overview

This module initializes the PrestaShop endpoint for the ecat_co_il domain.  It likely defines constants and potentially imports necessary modules for interacting with the PrestaShop API related to this specific domain.


## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A constant holding the current operating mode ('dev' in this case).  This likely affects configuration and behavior.

**Value**: 'dev'


## Notes

The extensive use of multiline docstrings suggests an effort towards thorough documentation of the module's purpose and intended use.  However, the current docstrings are largely empty and uninformative beyond basic metadata. More detailed descriptions of the intended use, the variables, and the module's functions would enhance the usefulness of this documentation.
