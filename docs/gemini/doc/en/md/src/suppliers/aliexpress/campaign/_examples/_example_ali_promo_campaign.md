# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_examples/_example_ali_promo_campaign.py

## Overview

This module provides an example of creating an AliExpress promotional campaign. It demonstrates instantiation of `AliPromoCampaign` and accessing campaign, category, and product data.  It also utilizes utility functions from the `src.utils` module for file handling, data processing, and logging.

## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A variable likely representing the operational mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  Its value is set to 'dev'.


### `campaigns_directory`

**Description**:  A `Path` object representing the directory containing AliExpress campaign data.  It's constructed from the Google Drive path (`gs.path.google_drive`) and the `'aliexpress'`, `'campaigns'` subdirectories.


### `campaign_names`

**Description**:  A list of strings, potentially containing the names of various campaigns found in `campaigns_directory`.  Obtained using `get_directory_names`.


### `campaign_name`, `category_name`, `language`, `currency`

**Description**: Strings representing the campaign, category, language, and currency, respectively.  Used as parameters to the `AliPromoCampaign` class.

## Functions

(No functions are explicitly defined in this example, but the code utilizes functions imported from other modules, which are not documented here due to lack of code content.)


## Classes

### `AliPromoCampaign`

**Description**: A class for creating and managing AliExpress promotional campaigns.  (Not fully documented as no class body is present.)


### `AliAffiliatedProducts`

**Description**: A class likely for managing or retrieving affiliated products associated with a campaign.  (Not fully documented as no class body is present.)

## Usage Example

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to instantiate an `AliPromoCampaign` object and access related campaign, category, and product data.  It further showcases the use of `SimpleNamespace` for structuring the results.

```python
# Example Usage (Illustrative)
campaign_name = '280624_cleararanse'
category_name = 'gaming_comuter_accessories'
language = 'EN'
currency = 'USD'

a: SimpleNamespace = AliPromoCampaign(campaign_name=campaign_name,
                                     category_name=category_name,
                                     language=language,
                                     currency=currency)

campaign = a.campaign
category = a.category
products = a.category.products
```

**Note:**  The code snippets with `"""` docstrings seem to be intended for documentation purposes, but aren't fully utilized for class and function documentation within this example file.   Further code context (specifically the `AliPromoCampaign` class) is needed for complete and accurate documentation.
