```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling. If `get_project_root` couldn't find the project root, it would silently return the current directory, which is incorrect and could lead to import errors.  The updated code raises a `RuntimeError` if no root is found, forcing the calling code to deal with the problem. This is *vital* for robust code.

* **Clarity and Style:** Minor stylistic improvements for better readability.

* **Docstring Enhancement:** Docstring for `get_project_root` was improved to include a crucial detail:  raises `Exception` if no root can be found.  This critical information is now part of the API contract.  The docstring also includes a `Returns` section.

* **`sys.path` Modification:**  The insertion of the root path into `sys.path` is done *only if* the path is not already present in `sys.path`.   This is a more robust way of handling path inclusion.  (the prior version might have duplicated entries).

* **Explicit Return:** The return statement from `get_project_root` is now explicit and handles the case where a root is found and already in `sys.path`.

* **Import Order:**  Standard Python practice suggests imports are grouped (e.g. standard library, third-party, then local).

* **Noqa directive:**  Added `# noqa`  comment after `from .version import ...` to suppress warnings about unused imports.

* **`__root__` Assignment:** `__root__` is assigned *after* the call to `get_project_root`, which is important for the value to be properly computed.


**How to use this improved code:**

Put this code in your `__init__.py` file.

```python
# ... other imports ...

# Get the root directory of the project.
try:
  __root__ = get_project_root()
  from src import gs
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Error finding project root: {e}")
  # Handle the error appropriately (e.g., exit the program)
```

This ensures that if `get_project_root` fails, your script gracefully handles the issue, rather than silently failing.  Now your imports will work as intended.


By using this improved version, your code will be more robust and reliable.  It's crucial to always consider error handling when dealing with file paths and imports.
