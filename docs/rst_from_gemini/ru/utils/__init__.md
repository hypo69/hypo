**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `get_project_root` function now raises a `FileNotFoundError` if no matching marker file is found, preventing cryptic errors later in the code.  Crucially, this error is raised *immediately*, preventing silent failure.
* **Robust Path Handling:** Instead of potentially adding non-existent paths to `sys.path`, the code now explicitly checks if the path exists using `bin_path.exists()`.  This prevents errors if paths are incorrectly specified.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is reorganized for better readability, using a list comprehension to define `paths_to_add`. The variable names are improved (`gtk_bin_path` instead of `gtk`).  The logic for adding paths to `sys.path` is made clearer.
* **Docstring Improvements:** The docstring for `get_project_root` is enhanced to include details about what happens when the root is not found and it now explicitly states that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised if the marker files are not found.  This crucial documentation provides context to developers using the function.

**How to Use (Example):**

```python
import src.utils

try:
    root_dir = src.utils.__root__
    print(f"Project root: {root_dir}")
    # Now use root_dir for other operations
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This revised code is more robust, easier to understand, and significantly less prone to subtle errors that might have occurred due to missing or invalid paths.  It prioritizes error handling and makes the code more maintainable. Remember to replace the `...` with the rest of your imports. Always handle potential errors in your application code.
