# Changes Made

*   Converted the markdown-formatted content into a Python module.
*   Added docstrings (using reStructuredText) to describe the module and each function.
*   Removed unnecessary headings and formatting.
*   Replaced the comments with actual Python functions returning strings that contain the instructions and policy. This makes the module reusable.
*   Added type hints to functions.
