# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/utils/video.py`

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, and retrieving video data. It handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

## Functions

### `save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]`

Downloads a video from a given URL and saves it to the specified local path.  This function is asynchronous, meaning it can perform other tasks while the download is in progress.

**Parameters:**

* `url` (str): The URL of the video file to download.
* `save_path` (str): The local path where the video should be saved.  This should include the filename (e.g., `myvideo.mp4`).

**Returns:**

* `Optional[Path]`: The path to the saved video file if successful.  Returns `None` if the download or saving process fails (e.g., network error, file not saved, empty file).


**Error Handling and Logging:**

The function includes comprehensive error handling:

* **Network Errors (`aiohttp.ClientError`):** Catches network-related issues during download (e.g., connection problems).  Logs the error and returns `None`.
* **File Saving Errors:** Catches exceptions during file saving (e.g., permission issues). Logs the error and returns `None`.
* **Empty File Check:**  Crucially checks if the downloaded file is empty. If the file has zero bytes, it returns `None` and logs the issue.
* **File Existence Check:** Checks if the file was actually saved, returning `None` if it does not exist after the download attempt.
* **Logging:** Uses the `logger` from `src.logger` to record both successful and error conditions. This allows you to track download progress and identify problems.

**Example:**

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

async def main():
  url = "YOUR_VIDEO_URL" # Replace with a valid URL
  save_path = "downloaded_video.mp4"
  result = await save_video_from_url(url, save_path)
  if result:
      print(f"Video saved to: {result}")
  else:
      print("Video download failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```


### `get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]`

Retrieves the binary data of a video file if it exists.

**Parameters:**

* `file_name` (str): The path to the video file.

**Returns:**

* `Optional[bytes]`: The binary data of the video file if found, or `None` if the file doesn't exist or if an error occurs during reading.

**Error Handling and Logging:**

* **File Not Found:** Catches the case where the file does not exist at the specified path, returning `None` and logging the error.
* **Read Errors:** Catches any exceptions encountered during reading the file, returning `None` and logging the error.


**Example:**

```python
import asyncio

def main():
  file_name = "downloaded_video.mp4"
  data = get_video_data(file_name)
  if data:
      # Process the video data (e.g., convert to a different format)
      print(data[:10]) # Print the first 10 bytes for verification
  else:
      print("Could not retrieve video data.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The extensive error handling is crucial for robust applications.  Always check the return value of `save_video_from_url` to determine if the download was successful.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `asyncio.run()` to run the asynchronous `save_video_from_url` function.
* **`src.logger`:** Ensure that the `src.logger` module is properly configured in your application.
* **Replace placeholders:**  Update `YOUR_VIDEO_URL` and file paths with the actual values for your use case.
