## Changes Made

- Added missing imports (`json`, `logging`).
- Replaced `...` with appropriate implementation for `current_url`.
- Added RST-style docstrings for the class, methods, and variables.
- Implemented error handling with `try...except` blocks and logging to `logger`.  (using `logger.critical` and `logger.error` for appropriate error levels)
- Used `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON loading.
- Corrected the missing `current_url` method.
- Improved code structure and readability using more descriptive variable names.
- Added comprehensive docstrings adhering to RST and Python standards.
