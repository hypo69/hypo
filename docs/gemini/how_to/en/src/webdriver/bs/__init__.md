## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for a WebDriver-related module likely part of a larger application (`hypotez`). It primarily imports a class or function named `BS` from a submodule (`hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py`).

**Functionality:**

The file initializes a `MODE` variable with the string value `'dev'`.  This suggests a possible configuration for development mode, likely impacting how the `BS` object (or related functions/classes) operate.  This could affect things like logging levels, data sources, or other aspects of behavior.

**How to use:**

1. **Import:**
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.webdriver.bs import BS
   ```

2. **Usage of `BS`:**  The crucial step is accessing the `BS` class or object defined within `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py`.  Since the `__init__.py` file only imports `BS`, you'll need to examine that submodule to understand how to instantiate and use `BS`.

   ```python
   # Example (assuming BS is a class):
   my_bs_instance = BS()
   # ... use my_bs_instance ...
   ```


**Important Considerations:**

* **`hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py`:** The actual implementation details reside in this file.  This guide assumes that `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py` contains the definition of the `BS` object (e.g., a class or function), including its methods and attributes. Thoroughly review this module to grasp how to leverage the `BS` component.

* **Development Mode (MODE = 'dev'):** Understanding the effects of `MODE='dev'` is essential. Different configurations for `MODE` might affect the behavior of your `BS` objects. Check the implementation in `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py` to learn what impacts the code.

* **Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies (e.g., libraries for web drivers) are installed in your project environment.


**Example `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py` (Illustrative):**

```python
from selenium import webdriver

class BS:
    def __init__(self, driver_path="path/to/chromedriver"):  # Example
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)
```

In this example, `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py` defines a `BS` class that takes a `driver_path` to initialize a `ChromeDriver` instance.  Your actual implementation might differ significantly, possibly using other drivers, configurations, or initialization logic.

**Recommendation:**  To improve usability, add docstrings to the `BS` class and any important functions in `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/bs.py`.  This will provide users with clearer information on how to interact with the library's objects.
