```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `locators` and the Selenium driver interactions.  This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the `login` function from the external dependencies (Selenium, and real network requests). 

2. **Driver Fixture:** A `@pytest.fixture` named `driver_fixture` is introduced to manage the Selenium webdriver.  It creates, uses, and then quits the driver for each test. This is the *correct* way to interact with Selenium within a `pytest` test framework.

3. **Error Handling:**  The tests now include `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions like `AttributeError` and `TypeError` that might occur due to bad input or incorrect usage of the `login` function.  The test now checks for the expected exception string to validate that it is the correct exception being raised.

4. **Valid Input Test:** The test `test_login_valid_input` now has a sensible assertion `assert login(supplier) is True` to test if it works as intended with mock objects.

5. **Edge Case Tests:** The example now includes tests covering cases where locator lookups fail.


**How to Run:**

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest selenium
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


**Crucial Considerations:**

* **Real Driver vs. Mock:** For a production-quality test, avoid using mocking if possible! In your actual implementation, you should replace the mocked `WebDriver` instances with a *real* WebDriver instance.  
* **Selenium setup:** Ensure you have Selenium properly set up on your system. You might need to install the appropriate webdriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
* **Error handling:** The `login` function needs to handle exceptions properly in the real code. The placeholder `TODO` should be replaced with error handling and logging.
* **Data-Driven Tests:** Consider adding more data-driven tests if the `login` function takes arguments or complex data for different accounts.
* **Clean-up (in `driver_fixture`):** The `driver.quit()` ensures the WebDriver is properly closed after each test, preventing resource leaks.
* **Realistic Tests:** This is a skeleton for starting your test suite. Expand on these basic cases.  Add tests for other scenarios (invalid usernames/passwords, different failure conditions, etc.). Remember to adapt this example to the actual behavior of the `login` function.



This revised example is significantly more robust and provides a much better starting point for your `pytest` tests. Remember to adjust it to the specific logic and error handling required by your actual `login` function.
