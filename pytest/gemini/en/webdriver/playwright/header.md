**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs`:** The crucial part is mocking the `gs` module.  The provided code depends on `gs.path.root`.  This solution uses a `MockGS` class to provide dummy `path` and `root` attributes for testing.  This is *essential* for isolating the `get_project_root` function from external dependencies.


* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various scenarios, including existing projects, missing marker files, and correct handling of exceptions. The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is now used to create temporary directories and files, ensuring clean tests.


* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test names to better reflect their purpose.

* **Exception Handling:**  Tests now cover cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might not exist or be invalid JSON, correctly handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.


* **Mocking settings.json and README.MD:** The tests include explicit creation of mock files and content to control input for testing.


* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Uses `pytest.fixture(tmp_path)` to create a temporary directory for each test, ensuring test isolation. This is essential for avoiding conflicts between test runs.


* **Explicit `gs_mock` argument:** Added `gs_mock` to `get_project_root` to allow mocking for the test.

This revised solution is far more robust and addresses the critical need for mocking external dependencies when writing unit tests. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
