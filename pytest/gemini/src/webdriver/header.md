**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`tmpdir` fixture:**  The solution now uses `pytest.tmpdir` to create temporary directories for testing. This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing interference between them.  This ensures that operations on files (like `settings.json` and `README.MD`) don't affect other tests or the actual project directory.

2. **Dummy Data:** The `dummy_settings_json` fixture creates a temporary `settings.json` file with predefined content. This allows tests to operate on the expected data.  The function `remove_settings_file()` cleans up this file, ensuring test isolation.

3. **Comprehensive Exception Handling:**  The tests now handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during the file reading operations, preventing unexpected crashes.  The test `test_load_settings_invalid_json` is introduced to simulate this.

4. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid`, `test_load_settings_valid`).

5. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly used to assert that the expected exceptions are raised when the `set_project_root` function or file reading fails.

6. **Modularity:** Added the `create_settings_file` and `remove_settings_file` functions to better manage the creation and removal of temporary files, improving testability and reducing code duplication.

7. **Edge Cases:** The test cases now include tests for cases where marker files are not found, files are in a parent directory, and no marker files are passed,  testing boundary conditions.

8. **Import Adjustments:** The code now correctly imports necessary modules (e.g., `Path`) within the test file, and imports the relevant modules from `hypotez.src.webdriver.header` to properly test the functions in the target file.


This improved solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for the provided Python code, helping to ensure the correctness and reliability of the project's logic in different scenarios.  Remember to install `pytest` and the `packaging` library (`pip install pytest packaging`).   Also, make sure to replace `"hypotez"` with the correct path to your project if it's different.
