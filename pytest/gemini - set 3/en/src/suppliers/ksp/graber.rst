```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `Driver` object and relevant methods within the `Graber` class.  This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding external dependencies.  The `side_effect` is used to control the behavior of `execute_locator` when called.


2. **Asynchronous Handling:**  The tests correctly use `asyncio.run(future)` to execute the asynchronous functions (`grab_page`, `id_product`, etc.). This is essential for testing asynchronous code in pytest.


3. **Exception Handling:** The `test_grab_page_execute_locator_exception` test demonStartes how to handle exceptions during `execute_locator`.


4. **Complete Test Cases:**  The `test_grab_page_valid_input` test is more comprehensive now. It mocks the internal function calls within `grab_page` to cover the different data fetching scenarios.


5. **Example Test (`test_id_product`):** The example shows how to test a specific function within the `Graber` class. Replace the placeholder assertion (`assert graber.fields.id_product is not None`) with the actual assertion for `id_product`.


6. **Clarity and Readability:** Added more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each test and the logic behind mocking different scenarios.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the tests in a file named `test_graber.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.
3. Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Crucial Considerations:**

* **Real Data:** In a production environment, you'll need to replace the mocked data with actual data or valid data from a database or external source. The mocked data is vital for running the tests, but your production code should depend on real data if possible.
* **Database Interactions (if applicable):** If your `graber.py` code interacts with a database, you'll need to mock database operations in your tests.
* **Complex Scenarios:**  For more complex scenarios, carefully mock the various methods and data flows within `graber.py` to test each part in isolation.
* **`ProductFields` object:** Make sure the `ProductFields` object and its attributes are properly defined, or update the assertions based on your actual class.


Remember to adapt the assertions and mocking to the specific logic and data structures of your `graber.py` file. These updated tests are a good starting point, but refine them further to cover all the necessary scenarios.
