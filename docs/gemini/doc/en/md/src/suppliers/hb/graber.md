# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for grabbing product fields from the HB supplier. It utilizes asynchronous operations and interacts with a `Driver` instance to extract data.  The class inherits from `Grbr` (likely a base Graber class).  Global settings are managed via a `Context` object, and a `close_pop_up` decorator is implemented (although not currently used within this file).


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class handles the asynchronous process of grabbing product fields from the HB supplier. It manages the supplier prefix and interacts with the `Driver` object.

**Attributes**:

- `supplier_prefix` (str):  The prefix used to identify the supplier.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`: Initializes the `Graber` instance with a `Driver` object. Sets up global settings via `Context`, and potentially other initializations.

- `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`:  Asynchronous function that grabs product fields from a given URL.

    **Parameters**:
        - `driver` (Driver): The `Driver` instance used for interacting with the web page.

    **Returns**:
        - `ProductFields`: The extracted product fields in a `ProductFields` object.

    **Raises**:
        - `ExecuteLocatorException`: Raised if there's an error executing a locator (e.g., if a pop-up doesn't exist).


## Functions


### `close_pop_up(value: Any = None) -> Callable`

**Description**: This is a decorator function that aims to close pop-ups before executing a function. It's not currently utilized within the `Graber` class.

**Parameters**:
   - `value` (Any): An optional additional value passed to the decorator.

**Returns**:
   - `Callable`: A decorator that wraps the target function.


## Variables


### `MODE`

**Description**: A global variable, likely used to define the current mode (e.g., 'dev' for development or 'prod' for production).



## Notes

The `grab_page` method contains a significant amount of commented-out code, indicating a large number of potential data fields that can be extracted.  These fields are likely fetched using specific functions (e.g., `self.id_product()`, `self.name()`, etc.) which are not explicitly documented here.  Careful inspection of those functions would be needed to understand their intended behavior and parameter requirements.  Also, there's a `global d` declaration, indicating a potential global variable that needs review.
