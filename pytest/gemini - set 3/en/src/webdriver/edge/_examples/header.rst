**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`dir_root` Variable:** The code now defines `dir_root` using `Path(os.getcwd())`, which is a more robust approach to getting the current directory.  Crucially, it now also verifies that the `dir_root` actually exists.

2. **Import Verification:** Added `test_import_success` to check if fundamental imports like `Path` are successful. This covers a critical baseline for execution.

3. **`sys.path` Test Cases:** Includes tests for appending to `sys.path` to ensure the code appends the path correctly and doesn't lead to unexpected errors from duplicate appends.  Includes cleanup to prevent side effects.

4. **`dir_root` Construction Test:** Added a test to verify that `dir_root` is constructed as expected.  This is essential to catch errors in determining the path.

5. **Placeholder Tests:** Added `test_potentially_dangerous_function_with_invalid_input` as a placeholder.  Replace the comment with the actual function and expected exception to properly test error handling.

6. **Error Handling (Crucial):** The example for handling exceptions now includes a `pytest.raises` context manager. It shows how to use this to ensure that the expected exception is raised when invalid input is given.


**How to use:**

1.  **Replace placeholders:** Update the placeholder comments in the `test_potentially_dangerous_function_with_invalid_input` function and other parts of the test script with the actual functions and inputs from the `header.py` code.
2.  **Run pytest:** Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`). Then, run `pytest` from the directory containing your test file.

This significantly improves the test suite by:
*   **Robustness:** Handling cases where `dir_root` might not exist and preventing unexpected behavior.
*   **Completeness:** Verifying crucial steps in the code (importing libraries and modifying `sys.path`) and checking for correct path construction.
*   **Error Handling:** Showing how to test for expected exceptions using `pytest.raises`, a vital part of writing robust tests.


Remember to replace the example functions and expected exceptions with the specific functions and errors related to the actual code in `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/_examples/header.py`.
