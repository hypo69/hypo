```
**Received Code**:

```python
## \file hypotez/src/ai/__init__.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
""" module: src.ai """
MODE = 'development'


from .gemini import GoogleGenerativeAI
from .openai import OpenAIModel
```

**Improved Code**:

```python
"""
Module containing AI models.
"""
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
MODE = 'development'


from .gemini import GoogleGenerativeAI
from .openai import OpenAIModel


```

**Changes Made**:

- Added a module-level docstring in RST format explaining the purpose of the module.
- Removed unnecessary comments like `""" module: src.ai """` that were already implied by the file location.  The new docstring is more helpful for users.
- Improved formatting for consistency.
