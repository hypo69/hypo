**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import `logger`:**  Import the necessary logger from `src.logger` for error handling.
* **Clear Test Function Names:** Test names are descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Error Handling with `logger`:** The code now uses `logger.error` to log exceptions during file loading, which is better practice than relying solely on `pytest.raises` for every error case.
* **Example Fixtures:** Included an example fixture (`example_data`) that can be adapted to your actual needs.
* **Valid and Invalid Input Tests:** Tests now cover both valid and invalid input scenarios.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Uses `pytest.raises` to specifically test exception handling (e.g., invalid JSON).
* **Realistic File Paths:** Added a placeholder for a file path to help with running the test in a real environment (you'll need to replace the placeholder with the correct path).
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Tests now include `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions, preventing test failures due to missing files or issues with the JSON data.

**Critical Notes:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** You **must** replace the placeholder `file_path` with a valid path to a JSON file on your system to run the file loading tests.
* **`j_loads_ns` Tests:**  Add similar test cases for the `j_loads_ns` function if it exists in your code.
* **Add Actual Code:** The provided example `Input code` is empty.  Replace the `...` in the `Input code` section with the actual Python code you want to test, and adjust the tests to match the functions and methods.


This revised solution provides a more robust and practical approach to writing `pytest` tests that include necessary error handling, realistic file paths, and both valid and invalid input cases. Remember to replace placeholders and adapt the tests to suit the structure of your actual code. Remember to adapt the test data and paths to your actual test environment. Remember that the tests assume that you have the file located at `src.utils.jjson`.
