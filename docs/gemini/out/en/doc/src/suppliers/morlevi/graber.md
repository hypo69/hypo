# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is responsible for collecting product fields from the `morlevi.co.il` website.  It provides functions for handling various product fields, allowing for customized data extraction.  The class leverages the `Graber` base class and includes asynchronous operations for efficient data retrieval.  The module also features a `@close_pop_up` decorator (commented out) for optional pop-up window closure before data collection.  

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class extends the `Grbr` base class to handle Morlevi-specific data extraction logic.  It initializes with a driver instance and the supplier prefix.  It provides an asynchronous function (`grab_page`) for retrieving all necessary product fields.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`
    **Description**: Initializes the `Graber` instance with a driver and the supplier prefix.
    **Args**:
        - `driver (Driver)`: The WebDriver instance to use for interaction.
    **Raises**:
        - `Exception`: General error during initialization.

- `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`
    **Description**: Asynchronously retrieves product fields from the webpage.
    **Args**:
        - `driver (Driver)`: The WebDriver instance.
    **Returns**:
        - `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product fields.
    **Raises**:
        - `Exception`: Errors during data extraction.


- `local_saved_image(self, value: Any = None)`
    **Description**: Fetches a product image, saves it locally, and stores the path in the `ProductFields` object.
    **Args**:
        - `value (Any, optional)`:  An optional value that can be used to override the image fetching process. Defaults to `None`. If provided, the value will be directly used for handling.
    **Returns**:
        - `bool`: Returns `True` if image saving is successful, `False` otherwise.
    **Raises**:
        - `Exception`: Any error during image fetching or saving.

## Functions

*(Note: The commented-out `close_pop_up` function is not documented as it's not currently used.)*

## Notes

- The code includes numerous commented-out lines, indicating a collection of methods that are not implemented but could be added based on their documentation.
- The `fetch_all_data` function and related calls are placeholder functions and require implementation.
- Error handling is partially implemented but needs to be further refined for better robustness.  The use of `logger` and exceptions suggests improved logging and error management compared to earlier versions.
- The `local_saved_image` method demonStartes a more structured approach to fetching and saving images, including error handling using `try...except` blocks and more descriptive error messages.
- The `@close_pop_up` decorator (commented out) demonStartes a potential mechanism for closing pop-up windows prior to other data extraction procedures. It shows a more refined exception handling approach, using the `ExecuteLocatorException` to address the case where the locator fails to close a popup.
