How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` to locate the project root directory.  It then loads project settings from `src/settings.json` and project documentation from `src/README.MD`.  Finally, it retrieves and assigns various project metadata attributes (name, version, documentation, etc.) to variables for later use.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from the `packaging` module, and `Path` from the `pathlib` module.
2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names as an argument.  It starts by getting the current file's directory. It iterates upwards through parent directories until it finds a directory containing any of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
3. **Setting the Project Root:** The function sets the project root path and adds it to the Python path if it isn't already present.
4. **Loading Project Settings:** The code attempts to load settings from `src/settings.json`. If the file doesn't exist or is not a valid JSON, it handles the potential errors gracefully.
5. **Loading Project Documentation:** The code attempts to load project documentation from `src/README.MD`. If the file doesn't exist or is not readable, it handles the potential errors gracefully.
6. **Assigning Metadata:** The code assigns project metadata (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a coffee tip) from the settings dictionary to project-related variables. If settings are not available or the relevant key doesn't exist, default values are used.
7. **Return the Root Directory:** The function returns the determined project root directory.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.emil.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage (assuming your code is in a file called header.py)
    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root directory: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Project documentation:\n {__doc__}")
    # ... (access other metadata variables as needed)

    # Example to demonstrate adding to sys.path
    # This will check if a specific directory is already in sys.path, 
    # which is important in avoiding duplicate entries.
    if os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) not in sys.path:
      sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

    # ... (your rest of your code that utilizes this header)
