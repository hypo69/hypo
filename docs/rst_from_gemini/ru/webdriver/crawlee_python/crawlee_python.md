## File: hypotez/src/webdriver/crawlee_python/crawlee_python.py

This file implements a Python script for web crawling using the `crawlee` library and Playwright. It defines a `CrawleePython` class that encapsulates the crawling process, from setting up the crawler to running it and exporting the extracted data.

### Module Description

This module (`crawlee_python`) provides functionality for web scraping and data extraction.  It leverages the `crawlee` library to efficiently manage the crawling process, including handling requests, enqueuing links, and extracting data using Playwright.

### Class: CrawleePython

The `CrawleePython` class manages the entire crawling lifecycle.

**Constructor (`__init__`)**:
```python
    def __init__(self, max_requests: int = 5, headless: bool = False, browser_type: str = 'firefox'):
```
Initializes the crawler with parameters:
- `max_requests`: Maximum number of concurrent requests.
- `headless`: Whether to run the browser in headless mode.
- `browser_type`: The type of browser to use (e.g., 'firefox', 'chromium').

**Methods:**

- **`setup_crawler()`**:
```python
    async def setup_crawler(self):
```
Initializes the `PlaywrightCrawler` instance with the specified parameters.  Critically, it defines a `@self.crawler.router.default_handler` that will process each page visited. This allows for consistent data extraction.


- **`run_crawler(urls)`**:
```python
    async def run_crawler(self, urls: list[str]):
```
Runs the crawler with the provided list of initial URLs.

- **`export_data(file_path)`**:
```python
    async def export_data(self, file_path: str):
```
Exports the extracted data to a JSON file at the specified path.

- **`get_data()`**:
```python
    async def get_data(self) -> dict:
```
Retrieves the collected data as a dictionary. This method is crucial for accessing the results after the crawl.

- **`run(urls)`**:
```python
    async def run(self, urls: list[str]):
```
The main method that orchestrates the entire process. It sets up the crawler, runs the crawl, exports the data, retrieves and logs the data.  Crucially, it demonstrates proper use of `asyncio` for asynchronous operations.

### Usage Example (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    async def main():
        experiment = CrawleePython(max_requests=5, headless=False, browser_type='firefox')
        await experiment.run(['https://ksp.co.il'])

    asyncio.run(main())
```
This example instantiates the `CrawleePython` class and calls the `run` method to start the crawl from the provided URL.  It demonstrates how to integrate with the provided class and handle the asynchronous nature of the code.


### Important Considerations

- **Error Handling:** The code lacks explicit error handling.  Consider adding `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during the crawling process (e.g., network errors, invalid URLs, website changes).
- **Data Validation:** The code extracts only the first 100 characters of the page content.  Improve the data extraction to ensure complete and accurate data capture.  Consider using more sophisticated methods to extract information.
- **Robustness:** The usage of `Path` and `gs` suggests a deeper context that may require further documentation to clarify its functionality and role in the project.
- **Logging:** The `logger` is used, but the `src.logger` module should be documented to describe the logging setup.

This improved documentation provides a more comprehensive understanding of the code's purpose, functionality, and usage.  It also highlights potential areas for improvement, such as error handling and data validation. Remember to include documentation for the `gs` and `logger` modules if they are not self-explanatory within their own files.
