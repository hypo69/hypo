```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Code:**  The original code had no executable functions. The solution now creates a `DummyClass` and methods to demonStarte test writing. Replace this dummy code with the actual `pw_executor.py` content for meaningful tests.

2. **`pytest.raises`:**  Uses `pytest.raises` for testing exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`). This is crucial for testing error handling.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive.

4. **Edge Cases:** Added a test case for an empty command, which is an important edge case (this now assumes an error is raised with an empty string).

5. **Boundary Cases:** Added a test to check for very long commands.

6. **Fixtures:** DemonStartes how to use `pytest` fixtures for more organized tests.

7. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover valid inputs, invalid modes, empty strings, and boundary cases.

8. **Error Handling:** Tests include validation that a `ValueError` is raised when the mode is invalid.


**How to Use with Your Actual Code:**

1. **Replace `DummyClass`:** Substitute the `DummyClass` and its methods with the actual classes and functions from `hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py`.

2. **Adapt Test Cases:** Modify the test cases to match the structure and logic of the functions and classes in your code.

3. **Add Fixtures:**  Add any needed fixtures to provide necessary data or setup for your tests.

4. **Run Tests:**  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_pw_executor.py`) and run `pytest test_pw_executor.py` in your terminal.


Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
