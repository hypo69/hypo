# File: hypotez/src/endpoints/bots/version.py
# Linter Issues:

# 1. Missing type hints:  The variables `settings`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__` should have type hints.  Python type hints improve code readability and maintainability, and enable tools like mypy to catch type errors early.

# 2. Potential `__root__` error:  The `__root__` variable is used.  This is likely a path manipulation from a package management tool like Poetry or a similar setup.  If `__root__` isn't defined or set correctly, it will cause an error.  It's better to use a proper path joining mechanism.

# 3. Missing exception handling for `__project_name__`:  While the code handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, it doesn't catch errors that could arise from `settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez')`.  For example, if `settings` is a dictionary, but `settings['project_name']` is not a string, this could cause a type error.

# 4. `copyrihgnt` vs `copyright`:  The variable `settings.get("copyrihgnt", '')` should be `settings.get("copyright", '')`.  Typos are common and should be fixed to maintain code quality.

# 5. Unnecessary `if settings`:  All of the `if settings` checks can be simplified to eliminate redundant code. Python's `get()` method already handles the case where `settings` is None or doesn't have the key.

# 6. Redundant `__doc__` and `__details__` initialization:  The code initializes `__doc__` and `__details__` to empty strings.  If not used, this is unnecessary.

# 7.  Possible improvement: Consider using a dedicated `get_project_data` function (or similar) to encapsulate the reading of the `settings.json`. This makes the code more reusable and readable.

```python
""" module: src.endpoints.bots """
import json
import pathlib

from typing import Dict, Optional

settings: Optional[Dict] = None

# Use pathlib.Path to handle paths more safely.
settings_path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.parent / "settings.json"

try:
    with open(settings_path, 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading settings: {e}")  # Important: Log errors
    # Consider a more robust error handling mechanism (e.g., exit the app)

__project_name__: str = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez')
__version__: str = settings.get("version", '')
__doc__: str = settings.get("doc", "")  # Use get instead of direct access
__details__: str = settings.get("details", "")
__author__: str = settings.get("author", '')
__copyright__: str = settings.get("copyright", '')
__cofee__: str = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69")
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Type Hinting:** Added `Optional[Dict]` type hint to `settings` and appropriate type hints to other variables, improving type safety.
* **Pathlib:** Replaced the string-based path manipulations with `pathlib.Path`. This is more robust and platform-independent.
* **Error Handling:** Added error logging to the `try...except` block.  Crucially, the code now logs the error, which is important for debugging.
* **Simplified `if settings`:** Removed the redundant `if settings` checks within each `settings.get` call, improving code conciseness.
* **Removed Unnecessary Initializations:**  Removed the initialization of `__doc__` and `__details__` to empty strings if not used in the code.
* **Added `get`:** Changed the direct access to `settings['doc']` etc. to use the `get` method to handle the case where the key doesn't exist gracefully.
* **Clearer Error Handling:** Improved the error handling to include a more descriptive error message.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It addresses the potential issues and improves the overall quality of the `version.py` file.  Remember to install the `pathlib` module if you haven't already.  (It's part of the standard library)
