**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  It gracefully handles cases where `settings.json` doesn't exist or is corrupted, preventing the script from crashing.  The `print("Warning...")` statement is a good way to inform the user about the issue without halting execution.

* **Explicit Type Hinting (PEP 484):**  Using type hints like `settings: dict = None` is good practice.  It helps with code readability and can be helpful with static analysis tools.

* **`__doc__` and `__details__`:**  Critically, the code now ensures `__doc__` and `__details__` are *always* strings, even if the `settings.json` file doesn't contain them. Setting them to `""` is the correct approach, not `None`.  Setting them to `None` can cause errors later when those variables are used in a function that expects a string.


* **`__copyright__`:**  Corrected the typo in the variable name from `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.

* **Readability:**  Slightly reorganized the code for better visual flow.


**How to use this file:**

This `version.py` file is designed to be imported into other Python modules in your project.  You can then access the version information like this:

```python
import hypotez.src.ai.dialogflow.version as version_info

print(version_info.__version__)
print(version_info.__project_name__)
```


**Crucial `settings.json` Example:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024, My Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

Place this `settings.json` file in the `hypotez/src` directory (3 levels up from your `version.py` file).


By making these changes, your code is now robust, readable, and follows best practices. Remember to adjust the file paths if your project structure is different. Also, consider using a dedicated package management tool (like `setuptools`) for more sophisticated versioning and deployment in a production environment.
