**Explanation of Changes and Why They Were Made:**

The original code was a completely empty file.  To be a usable test file, it needs:

1. **Import `pytest`:**  This is essential for any pytest-based test.
2. **`@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator:**  Indicates that the function is an asynchronous test, which is often appropriate for interacting with external services like Facebook APIs.
3. **`test_post_message_in_biz` function:**  A descriptive function name, which is a standard pytest practice.
4. **`pytest` style docstring:** Explains the purpose of the test.
5. **Placeholder code:**  A placeholder `pass` statement. Replace this with your actual test code, which would involve:
    *  Setting up a test environment (e.g., initializing Facebook API client objects, creating mock data).
    *  Calling the function you are testing (the one posting the message).
    *  Assert statements to check the results of the call, verifying that the message was posted successfully, or any expected status codes/responses were returned.

This improved code structure makes the file functional as a pytest test file.  It also follows standard Python and pytest conventions. Remember to replace the `pass` statement with your actual test implementation. Importantly, you'll need the necessary libraries (e.g., for the Facebook API) installed in your virtual environment.


**Example using a Mock Facebook API (Replace with your actual code):**

```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from facebook_business.api import FacebookAdsApi
from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
# ... (other necessary imports)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_post_message_in_biz():
    """Тест отправки сообщения в бизнес-страницу."""
    # Mock Facebook API client (replace with your actual setup)
    mock_api = MockFacebookApi()
    
    # Replace with your actual function to post the message
    await post_message_to_facebook(mock_api, message_text="Test message")

    # Assertions to check the result (e.g., success status)
    assert mock_api.mock_call_count == 1
    assert mock_api.mock_results[0] == 'success'
    # ... more assertions ...
```

Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual interactions with the Facebook API, mocking or otherwise, and include appropriate assertions to validate the functionality under test.  The specific form of the test assertions will depend on the expected outputs of your `post_message_to_facebook` function.  For instance, you might check status codes, API responses, or database records for completeness.
