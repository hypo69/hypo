**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks `Driver`, `Context`, and other parts of the dependencies, preventing actual interactions with the web driver or external resources. This is crucial for isolating tests.  The `MockDriver` class mocks the `execute_locator` method.
* **`pytest.raises` for Error Handling:** The `test_local_image_path_error` test uses `pytest.raises` to verify that the `Exception` is correctly caught.
* **`ProductFields` Fixture:** Created a `ProductFields` fixture to provide a `ProductFields` instance for testing, instead of creating it directly in each test. This makes tests more readable.
* **`mock_context` Fixture:** A fixture for `mock_context` was added to pass the necessary context object to the tests.
* **Comprehensive `grab_page` test:**  A placeholder test case for `grab_page` is included. This is significantly more complex, so you'll need to add mocks to the necessary functions within `grab_page` to make the test complete. The tests now include checks for the type of the returned value.
* **`async def` for Tests:** All tests are `async def` to properly test asynchronous methods within the `Graber` class.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Error messages in the `test_local_image_path_error`  test have been made more descriptive.
* **Additional Assertions:** Add specific assertions to verify the content of `fields` after calling `grab_page`.
* **Testing with Valid Inputs:** The `test_local_image_path_success` test verifies that the image was correctly saved.
* **Complete Async Mock:** Correctly mocking `execute_locator` to return an `asyncio.Future` for `test_grab_page_success`.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2.  Replace placeholders like `gs.path.tmp`, `self.l`, etc. with your actual implementations or appropriate mocks.
3.  Add appropriate test cases for `id_product`, `description_short`, `name` (and any other functions called within `grab_page`) by mocking their behavior using `MagicMock`.


**Crucial:**

You need to adapt these tests based on the specific fields and operations you want to verify in your code.  The `test_grab_page_success` example is a *very* basic structure. You need to mock how `graber.id_product`, etc., work and make assertions on the fields of the returned `ProductFields` object.  The example needs much more complete mocking to properly verify behavior. Remember to replace the placeholder mocks (like `b'test_image'`) with the expected values.
