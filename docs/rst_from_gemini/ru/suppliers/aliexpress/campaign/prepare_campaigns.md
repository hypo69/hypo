"""
This module prepares AliExpress campaigns by processing categories, handling campaign data, and generating promotional materials.

### Examples:
To run the script for a specific campaign and a list of categories:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py summer_sale -c electronics books -l EN -cu USD

To process all campaigns in the specified locales:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py --all -l EN -cu USD

To process a specific campaign without categories:

    python src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaigns/prepare_campaigns.py summer_sale -l EN -cu USD

**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to `process_campaign_category`, `process_campaign`, and `process_all_campaigns`. This is crucial to prevent the entire script from crashing if an error occurs during processing of a single category or campaign.  The errors are logged, and appropriate return values (empty list for category processing, `False` for campaign processing) are used to indicate failure.

* **Empty List for No Products:** `process_campaign_category` now returns an empty list (`[]`) if no products are found for a category, making the function more robust.

* **Clearer Success Indication:** `process_campaign` now returns `True` to indicate successful processing of a campaign, and `False` if an error occurred.  This is very useful in understanding the script's outcome and taking appropriate action, for example, logging error details and halting further processing for that campaign.

* **Handling Missing Category:** The code now gracefully handles cases where categories are not provided (i.e. empty `args.categories`) by calling `process_campaign` to process the entire campaign.

* **Consistent Locale Handling:** Using `locales` in a more structured way to process a list of locales for specific campaigns.

* **Robust `main_process`:** Added  `if args.categories:` to the `main` function. This correctly calls `main_process` only when categories are provided, otherwise calling `process_campaign` to handle processing without specific categories.


These changes make the code significantly more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It's also much more reliable in the face of potential errors. Remember to replace placeholders like `gs.path.google_drive` with your actual path. Remember to install necessary libraries (`argparse`, `pathlib`).
