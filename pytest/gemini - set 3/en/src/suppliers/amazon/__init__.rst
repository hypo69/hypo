**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly describe the input and expected outcome.

2. **Fixture `sample_graber`:** A fixture is introduced to mock the `Graber` object. This is crucial for testing the `get_list_products_in_category` function without relying on a real Amazon API connection.  Crucially, the fixture now *mocks* the Amazon API calls to avoid external dependencies and allow us to control the outcome.

3. **Robust Exception Handling:** Tests now comprehensively cover invalid inputs (e.g., `None` or empty string category) and potential errors from the `Graber` class, including cases where `get_products_in_category` might raise an exception.   `pytest.raises` is correctly used for checking exceptions.

4. **Mocking `Graber`:**  The `test_get_list_products_in_category_graber_error` demonstrates how to test error handling within the `get_list_products_in_category` function if the `Graber` class itself throws an exception, which is much more realistic and useful.

5. **Placeholder Assertions:** The `test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input` includes placeholder assertions to check the structure of the `products` list.  *Replace* these with concrete expectations, e.g., checking that the list contains product titles, prices, etc.  This is *essential* for a real-world test.

6. **Missing `Graber` Test:** I added a placeholder comment for testing the `Graber` class itself.   This is essential, but you need to fill in appropriate test cases.

**How to use/adapt this:**

- **Replace `"test_amazon_credentials"`:** with the appropriate credentials or setup for your `Graber` class.
- **Implement a working `Graber`:** In your actual `Graber` class, make sure that `get_products_in_category` handles the various cases your tests are checking (e.g., empty categories, incorrect data types, exceptions from the Amazon API).
- **Add assertions:** In `test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input` and other tests, add specific assertions that check the expected return type (product data structure). For example, `assert isinstance(products[0], dict)`.
- **Adapt to actual error types:**  Adapt the exception-raising part of `test_get_list_products_in_category_graber_error` to match the specific exceptions that might be raised in your `Graber` class.

This significantly improved example now provides a much better structure for comprehensive and robust testing, including edge cases and error handling. Remember to adapt these examples to the exact structure and functionality of your code. Remember to fill in the necessary placeholder assertions in the tests.
