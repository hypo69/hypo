**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `service_account` function and  `json.loads` for avoiding actual API calls or file operations during testing.  This is crucial for unit tests to be fast and reliable.

2. **Mock Data:**  `MOCK_SPREADSHEET_DATA` provides dummy data for testing.

3. **Robust `get_by_title` Test:** The test now checks if the spreadsheet was created correctly  and if the `openall()` method is called. It also handles the case where the spreadsheet already exists.


4. **`get_by_id` Test:** The test now correctly mocks the `open_by_key` method and checks if the returned value matches the expected spreadsheet object.

5. **`get_all_spreadsheets_for_current_account` Test:** The test now mocks the `openall` method to return some mock data.

6. **`MockSpreadsheet` Class:**  A mock class is created to simulate the behavior of `gspread.Spreadsheet` objects. This allows for easier mocking of methods like `openall()`, `open_by_key()`, and `create()`.

7. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests now include more scenarios for `get_by_title`, `get_by_id`, `get_project_spreadsheets_dict` and `get_all_spreadsheets_for_current_account`.

8. **Error Handling:** Added a test for the case where the `spreadsheets.json` file is not found, triggering a `FileNotFoundError`.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save:** Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_gspreadsheet.py`).

3.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_gspreadsheet.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`global_settingspread`:** Make sure that the `Spreadsheet` and `service_account` classes are correctly defined and available in your project.  The import statements at the top of your test file should correctly point to those definitions.

* **Real API calls (optional):** If you need to test interactions with the actual Google Sheets API, you'll have to configure your environment to handle API keys and authentication.   Pytest, by itself, doesn't perform authentication. The mocks in the test solution are the best practice to run your tests isolated from actual api calls.

* **`@patch` usage:** `@patch` is a powerful tool.  Always specify the function or module you are patching, and be cautious about how you modify the mock object's behavior within the `with` block. Using a specific mock type (MockSpreadsheet) improves code organization.
