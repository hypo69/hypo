**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` class and `logger`. This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the `Graber` class from external dependencies (like the actual WebDriver).  Mocking `Context.driver` was also necessary for testing methods using it.

2. **Fixture for `Driver`:** A `@pytest.fixture` is created to provide a mock `Driver` object.  This improves code organization and makes it easier to use in multiple tests.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init_decorator_with_value`).

4. **Decorator Test:**  Tests are added to verify that the decorator (`close_pop_up`) is *not* called during initialization, as intended.

5. **Handling of `Context.locator_for_decorator`:** The tests now cover different scenarios related to `Context.locator_for_decorator`, verifying that the decorator logic is correctly handled or ignored when the variable is `None` or contains a value.

6. **Missing Tests:** The original code was missing tests, and this update includes more comprehensive tests for the `Graber` class's initialization (`__init__`).

7. **Example Test Structure:** The example test structure is adapted to the `Graber` class, mocking appropriate parts for unit testing. This example shows how you can test a method of the class.



**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_graber.py`) in the same directory as `graber.py`.
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Important Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **More `Graber` Methods:** Add tests for other methods (e.g., methods for handling specific fields) in the `Graber` class.
* **Error Handling:** Add tests for edge cases and exceptions that might be raised within the `Graber` methods.
* **Real WebDriver (Integration Test):** If you need to test the interaction with a real web browser, you can use a different setup for integration testing with the actual WebDriver, like using `pytest-selenium` or similar tools. But unit tests are most important for the class's internal logic.
* **Fixtures for Data:** Consider creating fixtures to provide test data for testing different input scenarios in `Graber` methods.
* **`close_pop_up` Implementation:**  The commented-out `close_pop_up` decorator needs further testing to ensure the asynchronous parts of the decorator function work as expected (making sure the WebDriver interaction is handled correctly).
