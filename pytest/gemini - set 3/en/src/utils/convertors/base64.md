**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the input type (e.g., `test_base64_to_tmpfile_invalid_base64`).
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test exception handling for invalid Base64 and the `FileNotFoundError`. This is crucial for robust testing.
* **Data Fixtures:** The `base64_data` fixture provides sample data, making tests more organized and reusable.
* **Edge Cases:** Tests cover empty strings, an invalid file name, and an image file (demonStarting the conversion to a temporary file of different types).
* **Cleanup:** The `cleanup` fixture removes the test image file after the tests to avoid file system issues (crucial for avoiding stale test data).
* **Empty String Test:** Added a test for an empty string input.
* **Assert File Not Empty:** Checks the contents are not empty after the decoding. This is a more robust way of verifying the correctness of the base64 decoding.
* **File Extension Check:** Added checks to ensure the temporary file has the correct extension to verify that the function works as intended.
* **Removed unnecessary comments:** Some comments were removed as they were redundant.


This significantly improved test suite covers more scenarios and uses better practices for `pytest` testing, making it more robust and maintainable. Remember to run `pytest` to execute these tests. Also, make sure to have a file named `test_image.png` in your test directory with some data for the image test.  If it is not present you will need to modify the test or add another fixture for the `test_image.png`.
