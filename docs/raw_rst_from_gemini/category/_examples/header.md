**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`get_project_root()` function:**  This is crucial. The original code was brittle and assumed the script was always run from the exact `hypotez` directory.  The new function handles potential errors more robustly and provides a clear error message if the root directory can't be found.  It also returns `None`, which allows the calling code to handle potential failures appropriately.

* **Error Handling:** The code now checks if `dir_root` is `None` after calling `get_project_root()`.  This prevents errors if the project root can't be found.  **Crucially,** this is where you handle potential issues.  You should either print an error and stop execution, use a fallback path, or take some other appropriate action.

* **Clearer Comments:** The comments explain the purpose of the code and the `get_project_root` function.

* **`sys.path.append(str(dir_src))`:** The original code had `sys.path.append(str(dir_root))` twice. This is problematic.  The correct way to add the `src` directory to the `sys.path` is to correctly find `src`'s absolute path.

* **Style:**  Improved PEP 8 compliance.

**Why this is important for robustness:**

The original code didn't handle the case where the script wasn't run from the root directory, potentially leading to module import failures. The improved version uses a function to get the project root, which is more robust and prevents unexpected behavior.


**How to use it:**

1. Save this revised code as `header.py` in the appropriate directory.
2. Modify your import statements in the rest of your code to reflect the updated structure.  Using the `get_project_root()` function helps with this.

This will make your code more maintainable, reliable, and easier to run from various directories within your project.  Importantly, it will make your code much more robust in the face of unpredictable directory structures. Remember to handle the potential `None` return value of `get_project_root()` appropriately in your code.
