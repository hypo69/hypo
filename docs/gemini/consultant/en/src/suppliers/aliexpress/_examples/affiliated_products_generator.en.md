Changes Made
- Added missing imports (`requests`, `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`, `logger`).
- Created a `Product` class to encapsulate product information.
- Added type hints for function parameters and return values.
- Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of `try-except` for general exceptions.
- Added detailed docstrings (reStructuredText) to the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class, the `process_affiliate_products` method, and the `__init__` method.  
- Added a basic error handling block to the `process_affiliate_products` method, returning an empty list if the input is not a list.
- Added a `Product` class to represent a product and its attributes.
- Added example placeholder values for the `promotion_link`, `local_saved_image`, and `local_saved_video` attributes in the `Product` class.
- Updated `example_usage.py` with function docstrings and correct usage of the `Product` class.
