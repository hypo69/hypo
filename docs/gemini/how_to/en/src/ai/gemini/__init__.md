How to use the `hypotez/src/ai/gemini/__init__.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/ai/gemini/__init__.py`, initializes the Gemini AI functionality.  It primarily serves as an entry point and imports necessary components.

**Contents:**

* **Module Docstring:** Provides a brief overview of the module, including its platform compatibility (Windows and Unix) and a synopsis ("Модуль модели `gemini`").  The synopsis translates to "Gemini model module" in English.
* **MODE Variable:**  Defines a variable `MODE` set to 'dev'. This likely indicates a development mode, and its purpose would depend on the specific implementation. It's crucial for understanding the context in which the code is being used (e.g., if `dev` mode activates specific logging or debugging).
* **Import Statement:** Imports the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class from the `.generative_ai` submodule within the same directory. This suggests that the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class contains the core logic for interacting with a Gemini-based AI model (likely from Google).

**How to Use:**

The primary way to utilize this module is through the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class.  The example below shows how to use this class (assuming the module is properly imported).  A detailed usage guide would be needed for that class, outlining which parameters to pass and how to interpret the results.

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.gemini import GoogleGenerativeAI

# Example Usage (replace with actual parameters)
model = GoogleGenerativeAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", model_name="gemini-pro")  # Replace placeholders
response = model.generate_text(prompt="Tell me a joke.")

print(response)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the required libraries for `GoogleGenerativeAI` (or any other external dependencies) are installed.
* **API Key:** The example shows the need for an API key (`YOUR_API_KEY`). This key is essential for authenticating with the Google AI API.
* **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling to the code (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully manage potential issues like API rate limits, authentication errors, or invalid input.
* **Configuration:** The `MODE` variable might influence configuration settings.  A dedicated configuration file or more complex handling might be employed for managing settings in different modes.
* **`GoogleGenerativeAI` Details:** A separate, detailed guide for the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class is needed to explain the parameters and methods it supports (like `generate_text`).


**Further Development:**

To create a comprehensive usage guide, provide the necessary details for the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class, including the types of input data, the structure of the output, and any specific configuration options. Include examples of how to use the class, as well as comprehensive error handling examples.
