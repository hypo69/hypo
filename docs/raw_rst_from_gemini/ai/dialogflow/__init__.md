**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Docstring Enhancement:** The original docstring was incomplete and didn't clearly explain the module's purpose.  The revised docstring:
   - **Clearly states the module's role:**  "This module provides access to Dialogflow AI services."
   - **Describes its functionality:**  "It imports necessary components for interacting with Google's Generative AI."
   - **Uses proper Markdown formatting:**  It uses Markdown style (`Module:`, `This module...`) for better readability and potential use in documentation generators.

2. **Clarity:** The added text clarifies that this module is part of a larger system (Dialogflow).

This improved docstring makes the purpose of the module immediately apparent to anyone reading the code, which is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.  It's also suitable for automatic documentation generation tools. Remember to adapt the docstrings further if your module has more complex functionalities or interacts with specific Dialogflow services.  Adding examples or links to relevant documentation could further enhance its value.
