**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Crucially, the `set_project_root` function now includes a `try...except` block. This catches potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions (if no suitable marker files are found), prevents the entire script from crashing, and provides a helpful error message. It also checks that marker files exist for the current directory.  A `SystemExit` is used in case of a project root error, as this is a major issue that should stop the entire program.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  Improved error messages help pinpoint the problem if a file isn't found.
* **Explicit Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` calls when reading files. This is crucial for handling various character encodings in files, especially README files which might contain special characters.
* **Default Values:** If `settings.json` or `README.MD` isn't found, it prints a warning message, preventing the script from failing.  It also sets empty strings for variables that need a default value rather than `None`.
* **Docstrings:** Added a more comprehensive docstring to the module explaining its purpose and usage.
* **Function Input:** The `marker_files` argument in `set_project_root` is now explicitly typed as a tuple of strings.  This helps with clarity.
* **Type Hinting:**  Added type hints to improve readability and maintainability (e.g., `-> Path` in `set_project_root`).

This revised code is more robust, provides better feedback to the user, and adheres to Python best practices. It handles potential issues gracefully and gives you helpful information if anything goes wrong. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` tuple if your project structure differs. Remember to place the appropriate files in the correct location within the project (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`, `src/settings.json`, `src/README.MD`) for this code to work.
