**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hypothesis for Robustness:** The code now utilizes `hypothesis` for generating diverse test data.  This is crucial for more comprehensive testing, especially for `save_text_file`.


2. **`test_file_path` Fixture:** A `test_file_path` fixture is created to manage temporary files effectively.  It creates, yields, and removes the test file, ensuring clean up after each test.  This is essential for preventing file system issues.


3. **Comprehensive Exception Handling:** Tests now include cases for `TypeError` and `FileNotFoundError`, covering situations where the input isn't a string or the file doesn't exist.  This is vital for code resilience.


4. **Edge Cases (Empty File and BOM):** Added tests for empty files and files with a BOM (Byte Order Mark) - common scenarios that need specific handling.



5. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and informative about the tested scenario.


6. **Docstrings:**  Docstrings for tests are added to clarify the purpose of each test.


7. **File Removal:** The code now removes the temporary test file to prevent build-up and maintain a clean test environment.


8. **Correct File Handling:** The code now writes to the file in binary mode (`wb`) to ensure that the BOM is handled correctly.  This ensures robust testing and handling of various file formats.

This improved solution significantly enhances the test suite's coverage and robustness. Remember to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest hypothesis
```
