**Explanation of Improvements and Fixes:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks around potentially problematic operations (e.g., file not found, spreadsheet not found, API errors). This is crucial for robustness.  The `FileNotFoundError` is now correctly handled if the service account JSON is missing.
* **`get_by_title`:**
    * **Correct Spreadsheet Creation:** The code now correctly creates a spreadsheet if it doesn't already exist.
    * **APIError Handling:** Included `try...except` block to handle potential API errors during spreadsheet creation or sharing.
    * **Clearer Output:**  Provides more informative messages about spreadsheet existence.
    * **Returns Spreadsheet Object:**  Crucially, the method now returns the actual `gspread.Spreadsheet` object, allowing for further operations. Returns `None` if the spreadsheet cannot be found or created.
* **`get_by_id`:**
    * **Error Handling:** Now includes a `try...except SpreadsheetNotFound` block, providing better error handling.
    * **Clearer Output:** Gives a more informative message when a spreadsheet with the given ID isn't found.
* **`__init__`:**
    * **Error handling:** Checks if the service account file exists, raising `FileNotFoundError` if it doesn't.
    * **Handles missing spreadsheet:** Now correctly handles the case where the spreadsheet doesn't exist, preventing a crash.
* **`get_project_spreadsheets_dict`:**
    * **Error Handling:** Checks for the JSON file existence before attempting to load data.

* **Type Hinting:** Improved type hints for better code clarity and maintainability.


**How to use the improved code:**

```python
from gspreadsheet import GSpreadsheet

# Create a GSpreadsheet object
try:
    gs = GSpreadsheet(s_title='My Spreadsheet Title') # or gs = GSpreadsheet(s_id='yourSpreadsheetId')

    if gs.gsh:  # Check if the spreadsheet was loaded
        # Example of getting all spreadsheets
        all_spreadsheets = gs.get_all_spreadsheets_for_current_account()
        for spreadsheet in all_spreadsheets:
            print(spreadsheet.title)
        
        # Example of accessing a sheet
        worksheet = gs.gsh.worksheet('Sheet1') # Replace 'Sheet1' with your sheet's title
        data = worksheet.get_all_records()
        print(data)
    else:
        print("Spreadsheet not found or could not be created.")

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

except Exception as e:  # Catch more general errors
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `'yourSpreadsheetId'` and `'Sheet1'` with your actual values. This revised code is significantly more robust and user-friendly.  Importantly, it avoids potential crashes due to invalid inputs and provides useful error messages. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install gspread google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```
