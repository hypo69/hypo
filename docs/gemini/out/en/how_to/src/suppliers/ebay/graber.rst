How to use the `graber.py` code block
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `Graber` for collecting product data from eBay. It inherits from the `Grbr` class (likely a base class for data grabbers), providing specific eBay-related data extraction logic. The code utilizes asynchronous operations (`asyncio`) and a `Driver` object for interacting with a web browser.  The class handles various product fields and provides methods (`id_product`, `name`, `description_short`, `specification`, etc.) to extract values for each field.  It also includes a place for potentially custom-made pop-up closure logic and a structure for passing various data extraction requirements in a `kwards` dictionary.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The script imports required libraries like `asyncio`, `pydantic`, and modules from the `src` package (likely a custom project).
2. **Define the `Graber` class:** This class inherits from `Grbr` and implements the `grab_page` method.
3. **Initialize the `Graber` object:** The constructor (`__init__`) sets up the class with a driver instance.  This likely represents the web browser automation.
4. **Implement the `grab_page` method:** This asynchronous method contains the core data extraction logic.
5. **Define `fetch_all_data` function:** This function calls the various individual field-fetching methods (e.g., `self.id_product`, `self.name`) passed through the `kwards`.
6. **Call `fetch_all_data`:** This function executes the code necessary for collecting all data required.
7. **Return `self.fields`:** The method returns the collected `ProductFields` object containing the extracted product data.
8. **Extract individual field values:** Individual methods (like `id_product`, `name`) within the `Graber` class likely interact with the web browser to retrieve data for each field. These methods are often designed to take `kwards` arguments to specify which data to retrieve, allowing flexibility in how data is pulled from the page.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.ebay.graber import Graber


    async def main():
        # Create a Driver instance (replace with your driver setup)
        driver = Driver(...)  # Replace with actual driver initialization

        # Create a Graber instance
        graber = Graber(driver)

        # Example usage, providing a dictionary of fields to grab
        kwards = {
            "id_product": "12345",
            "name": True,
            "description_short": True,
            "specification": True
        }

        # Run the grab_page method with the kwards dictionary
        try:
          product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, **kwards)
          print(product_data) # Output extracted product fields
        except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error during data extraction: {e}")

        # Close the driver (crucial)
        await driver.close()

    asyncio.run(main())
