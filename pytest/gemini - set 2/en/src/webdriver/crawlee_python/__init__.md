```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Class:** Since the provided `crawlee_python` code only defines a variable (`MODE`) and imports `CrawleePython`, a `DummyCrawleePython` class is created to allow testing.  Replace this with the actual `CrawleePython` class if you have it.


2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names like `test_get_mode_valid_input` and `test_crawlee_python_invalid_mode` clearly indicate the purpose of each test.


3. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The `test_crawlee_python_invalid_mode` and example test cases demonStarte how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (`ValueError`) when invalid input is provided.


4. **Fixtures for Reusability:** The `crawlee_instance` fixture provides a way to create a `CrawleePython` instance once, which is then reused across multiple tests, improving code efficiency and reducing redundancy.


5. **Edge Case Testing:**  The `test_crawlee_python_invalid_mode` test and example `test_get_mode_edge_case`  cover the case where an invalid mode (e.g., 'invalid_mode') is passed to the constructor.  


6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover the creation of the object, a fundamental check, and an important test case that verifies exception handling for invalid mode values.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_crawlee_python.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_crawlee_python.py
   ```

Remember to replace `DummyCrawleePython` with your actual `CrawleePython` class and add tests for any other methods or functions in your code if necessary.


This improved response provides a more robust and complete set of tests, addressing potential issues and offering a good starting point for writing tests for your code. Remember to adapt and expand these tests based on the actual functionality of your `CrawleePython` class.
