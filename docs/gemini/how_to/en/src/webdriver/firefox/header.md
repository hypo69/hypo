**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling.  The `set_project_root` function raises a `FileNotFoundError` if no root directory is found.  Crucially, it also catches exceptions during file loading and prints informative error messages, rather than silently failing. This is vital for production code.  The `try...except` blocks are also more specific, catching the correct exception types.
* **Explicit Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open` function when reading `README.MD`. This is important to handle files that might contain non-ASCII characters correctly.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Improved error messages to provide more context about what went wrong.
* **Exit on Error:** Includes `sys.exit(1)` to indicate an error to the calling program.  This is good practice; letting the program continue with potentially incorrect or missing information is problematic.
* **Return from `set_project_root`:** The `set_project_root` function now *returns* the found root directory.  This is better than using a global variable.
* **`sys.path` Insertion:** The code ensures that `root_dir` is added to `sys.path` *only if it's not already there*.  This is a minor but important optimization.
* **`__root__` is Path:** Makes `__root__` a Path object, as it should be.
* **More Informative Comments:** Provides better documentation and explains the reasoning behind choices, making the code easier to understand.


This revised code is significantly more robust and user-friendly, addressing potential issues and providing more meaningful feedback to the user in case of problems. Remember to adapt the error messages and the way errors are handled to fit your specific needs and the overall structure of your project. Remember to install the `packaging` package if you haven't already using `pip install packaging`.


This improved version is far more reliable and informative than the original.  It's important to adopt robust error handling in production code.
