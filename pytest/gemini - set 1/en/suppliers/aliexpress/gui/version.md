**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The `import pytest` line is essential for using the `pytest` library.

2. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names (`test_mode_constant`, `test_version_constant`) clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

3. **Assertion Style:** Uses `assert` statements to check the values of constants.

4. **Type Checking:**  Crucially, adds checks (`isinstance`) for the types of `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__author__`. This is vital to catch potential errors where these attributes are not strings, as expected.

5. **Handling `__name__`:** The test for `__name__` has been modified.  In a module, `__name__` would not be `__main__` unless the script itself is executed.   The commented-out section shows the old test, and the `pass` statement demonStartes a more practical solution in this case, as it would be unreliable to use an assumption based on a script running directly.

6. **No `example_data` fixture:** Since the provided code only has constants, a fixture wasn't necessary.  If the code had functions that accepted arguments, a fixture could be used to supply those arguments to the tests.

7. **Docstrings:**  Each test function has a docstring explaining its purpose and the specific behavior it's checking.

8. **Edge cases and Invalid Inputs:** The tests now target the core constants and ensure their proper attributes. Edge cases, in this particular code, are not very relevant, since it's only a module definition and not a function.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_version.py`  (or `pytest` if in the same directory)

This revised solution is more robust and complete by checking the data types and clarifying the nature of the constants being tested. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/version.py"` with the actual path to the file if it's in a different location. Remember to place the test script in the same folder as your module.
