```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The `load_json_file` function now uses `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and general exceptions during file loading.  It logs errors using `logger.error` instead of raising an exception directly in case of issues, which is more appropriate for production-level code.
* **Clearer Test Cases:** The test cases now have more descriptive names (e.g., `test_load_json_file_invalid_file`), making the test suite easier to understand.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Uses `pytest.raises` to check for `FileNotFoundError` in the `test_load_json_file_invalid_file` test, which is essential for robust exception handling testing.  Also added a test for `json.JSONDecodeError`
* **Example Data Fixture:** A `@pytest.fixture` is defined to provide example data, which is better for test organization.  The fixture is used in the `test_load_json_file_valid_input` test.
* **File Cleanup:** Added a `finally` block to remove the temporary test files created within the tests.  This prevents file buildup.
* **Import Statements:** Corrected the import statement to include the necessary modules for `j_loads`.
* **Comments and Docstrings:** Added more comments and docstrings following the reStructuredText (RST) guidelines as requested.
* **`TODO` markers:**  While no actual `TODO`s are present in this improved code, this format and example is shown to demonStarte proper comments about tasks that could be included.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_json_loader.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_json_loader.py`

This improved response addresses the detailed requirements, providing a more comprehensive and robust test suite for the `load_json_file` function. Remember to replace `"temp_data.json"` and similar placeholders with your actual file paths. Also, adapt the `example_data` fixture to match the actual structure of your input JSON files. Remember to replace `src.utils.jjson` with the actual location of your JSON handling module.
