# Module: src.suppliers._examples.header

## Overview

This module contains settings and initializations for the suppliers' example scripts. It defines a `MODE` variable and imports necessary modules like `os`, `sys`, and `pathlib` for interacting with the file system.  Importantly, it adds the project's root directory to the Python path (`sys.path`), allowing scripts in other parts of the project to be imported.

## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable holding the current operational mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  Currently set to 'dev'.

## Functions

### `None`

**Description**: No user-defined functions are present in this file.  The file mainly focuses on setting up the Python environment.


## Imports

### `os`

**Description**:  Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

### `sys`

**Description**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.  Primarily used here to modify the Python path.

### `pathlib`

**Description**:  Provides object-oriented implementations of file system paths. Used for working with file paths in an object-oriented way.

## Custom Objects


## Notes

The file defines a variable `dir_root` to represent the project's root directory and modifies `sys.path` to include it. This is a common practice for projects structured with a `src` folder. This ensures modules within the `src` directory are importable.  Additional calls to `sys.path.append` are present, though their purpose seems redundant given the initial setting.
