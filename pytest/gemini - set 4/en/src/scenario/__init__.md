**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy `Supplier` Class:** The code now includes a dummy `Supplier` class for testing.  In a real scenario, replace this with the actual `Supplier` class from your code.  Crucially, this dummy class has a `run` method that takes arguments and prints them.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

3. **Example Data:**  Example data is defined for scenarios, making the tests more concrete.

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**  The tests now cover valid input, potentially empty scenarios, and a single scenario file (an edge case that was missing before).

5. **Exception Handling (Placeholder):** The code has a placeholder `test_run_scenarios_invalid_input` which demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions (e.g., `TypeError` for invalid input).  **Crucially**, you need to uncomment this and adapt it according to the actual exceptions raised by your `run_scenarios` function.  If the functions don't raise exceptions with invalid data, this test won't be necessary.

6. **`pytest.mark.skipif`:** This decorator is used to skip the test, useful for situations where you don't have the actual Supplier class or it's still under development. You'll need to replace `True` with a more useful condition to determine when the test should be skipped.

7. **Assertions:**  Uses `assert result is True` to check the outcome of the function call.  You should use the correct assertion based on what the function is expected to return.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_scenario.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/scenario/__init__.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_scenario.py`


Remember to replace the dummy `Supplier` class and adapt the test cases to accurately reflect the expected behavior of the `run_scenario_files` and `run_scenarios` functions and any potential exceptions they might raise.  Also, consider how exceptions should be handled by your functions; if an error is expected for certain input, a test should verify that.
