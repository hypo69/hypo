```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` class and its methods. This is crucial for testing the `Graber` class independently of the actual WebDriver.  The `mock_simple_namespace` fixture correctly mocks the SimpleNamespace.

* **Asynchronous Execution:** The `asyncio.run` function is now used correctly to run the asynchronous functions within the test context.

* **Exception Handling:** The tests now incorporate a `pytest.raises` context manager to effectively verify that the `ExecuteLocatorException` is properly caught in the `close_popup` decorator.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the expected behavior and input type.

* **Complete Mock:**  Instead of just mocking `execute_locator`, we now mock the entire `Driver` object. This is more robust because it avoids unintended interactions with actual WebDriver objects.

* **`ProductFields` Mock:** A `MockProductFields` class is introduced to mock the `ProductFields` return value. This avoids needing to populate the entire data structure for these tests.  This is crucial for making the test independent of the *implementation* of `ProductFields`.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the test code:** Save the test code (with your modified file and the provided code snippets) as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_graber.py
    ```


This revised solution provides a much more robust and reliable test suite for the `Graber` class. Remember to adapt the `ProductFields` mocking as needed to reflect the real structure of the `ProductFields` object. This is the critical step in ensuring your tests are independent of specific implementation details. Also, make sure that your mocks effectively cover different scenarios, including errors, successful calls, and edge cases, when working with asynchronous functions. Remember to install necessary libraries.
