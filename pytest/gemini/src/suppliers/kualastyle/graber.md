**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Mock Objects:**  Crucially, I've added `MockDriver` and `MockLogger`.  You **must** mock the `Driver` and `logger` objects.  This is essential for unit testing because your `Graber` class relies on external dependencies.  Replace `MockDriver` with a proper mock if needed.


2. **Missing Logic:** The provided `Graber` code doesn't contain any *actual* logic (other than the `__init__` method).  Therefore, the example test cases are also placeholder. You **must** update these placeholder tests to cover the methods of the `Graber` class (e.g., the methods for extracting data).

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  The code snippet doesn't show exception handling.  You need tests for potential errors (e.g., network problems, invalid inputs) with `pytest.raises`.

4. **Context and Decorator Tests:**  The tests for `Context` and the decorator (`close_pop_up`) are marked as placeholders, as I don't see how it would work without an `async` function and a `Context.driver` implementation in your original file.  You need tests to validate that the decorator is applied correctly and that it handles potential `ExecuteLocatorException` or other exceptions within the `close_pop_up` function.

5. **Clearer Structure and Documentation:**  Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., `test_graber_valid_input`) for your tests, and add detailed comments to explain the purpose of each test case.

6. **Import Statements:** Ensure that all necessary imports are present (e.g., `pytest`).


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_graber.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.


**Important Note:**  This revised response provides a *template* for testing.  You need to replace the placeholder comments and add actual test cases based on the *complete* implementation of the Graber class, including the logic for processing web data.  The current code is insufficient to create fully functional tests.
