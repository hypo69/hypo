**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided tests cover the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` attributes, crucial for testing this module.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive, indicating the purpose of each test.

3. **Data Validation:** The tests ensure that the attributes have the correct types (e.g., `__version__` is a `Version` object). They also check for valid string format and non-empty values, which is vital for robust testing.

4. **Edge Case Handling:** The example `test_details_keys` demonstrates how to test edge cases, in this example by checking for presence of particular keys in the `__details__` dictionary (if it's expected to have keys). Adapt this to check your specific edge cases.

5. **Exception Handling (Example):** The commented-out `test_function_with_exception` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions.  Uncomment and adapt this if your code raises exceptions.


**Before Running:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The example tests are placeholders.  Modify them to accurately reflect the structure and contents of your `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/__init__.py`.  Import any necessary functions from the file. Add specific values or inputs to the tests.

* **Data:** Provide realistic and relevant data to your tests.

* **Logic:** If you have any functions or methods in the file to test (e.g. beyond the provided examples), then add specific tests for those as well.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save the tests as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_extentions.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_extentions.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution provides a more complete and robust test suite. Remember to thoroughly test all aspects of the code, considering valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual tests for any functions or methods present in the file.
