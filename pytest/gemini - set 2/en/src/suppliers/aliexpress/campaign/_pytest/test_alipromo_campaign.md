**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Exception Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` for exception testing in `test_initialize_campaign` and `test_get_category_products_with_json_files`.  This is crucial for robustness. The `match` argument helps to confirm the specific error message.

* **Comprehensive `test_get_category_products`:** The `test_get_category_products_with_json_files` test is improved by now also checking with an example where a file is incorrectly formatted (invalid json) or doesn't exist. This is a much more thorough test.

* **Clearer Mock Usage:**  More specific mocking is used, preventing accidental calls to unmocked functions.  This makes the tests more predictable and easier to understand.


* **Missing Tests:**  Crucially, I added `...`  for the remainder of the tests, since the provided code does not specify the complete implementation of all the methods.


**How to use the improved tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Put the `AliPromoCampaign` and `j_loads_ns` (or whatever the corresponding classes/functions) into appropriate Python files.
3.  Run `pytest` in your terminal.  This will now run your tests and report any failures.

**Important Considerations for Future Tests:**

* **Real File System Interaction:**  Consider testing interactions with the file system more realistically, perhaps by creating temporary files. This is more accurate.
* **Mocking External Dependencies:** If `AliPromoCampaign` interacts with external APIs or services, mock them accordingly.


By incorporating these improvements, your test suite becomes more reliable and robust, catching potential issues and ensuring code correctness in a more comprehensive manner. Remember to fill in the `...` parts of the tests to cover all the functions and methods in your actual code. Remember to replace the placeholders (`src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_promo_campaign` and so on) with the actual path to your modules.
