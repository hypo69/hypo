```

**Usage Guide:**

This Python file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for a set of scenarios related to the AliExpress supplier.  It's designed to be imported to access other modules within the `aliexpress/scenarios` directory.

**Key elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This likely defines the operational mode, potentially `'dev'` for development, `'prod'` for production, or other custom modes.  This variable is globally accessible within this package.

* **`from .login import login`:** This line imports the `login` function from the `login.py` file within the same `scenarios` directory. The `.login` part is a relative import, crucial for organizing your code.  This means you can now use the `login` function from anywhere in your code using this initialization file.

**How to use:**

To utilize the `login` function, you would import this initialization file in another module:

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.scenarios import *

# ... other code ...

try:
    login(username, password)  # Assuming login function takes username and password
    # ... code to execute after successful login ...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Login failed: {e}")
    # ... error handling ...
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`login.py`:** The `login.py` file needs to be present in the `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios` directory, defining the `login` function.  It likely handles the actual connection and authentication with AliExpress.

* **Error Handling:** The example code includes a `try...except` block, which is vital for production-quality code.  This allows graceful handling of potential errors during the login process.


* **Dependencies:**  Make sure any libraries required by `login.py` (e.g., for making HTTP requests) are installed in your virtual environment.


* **Documentation:**  The docstrings in `login.py` (and ideally in `__init__.py`) would specify the arguments and return values of the `login` function, along with any other relevant details for the function.  This enhances maintainability and understanding.


By following this structure, you create a well-organized and reusable system for managing AliExpress-related functionalities. Remember to adapt the example code to match the actual signature of your `login` function.
