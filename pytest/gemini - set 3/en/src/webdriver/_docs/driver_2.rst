**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses a `MockDriverBase` class to mock the `DriverBase` class.  This is crucial for testing because it isolates the `DriverBase` methods from the actual `selenium` webdriver (which would require a browser and potentially take a long time to run).


2. **Clear Test Cases:**  The test functions are more descriptive and clearly indicate the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_get_url_valid`).


3. **Edge Case Tests:** Added a test (`test_get_url_invalid`) to check the handling of an invalid URL.  A more robust test suite would add tests for different types of invalid input.


4. **Parameterization:** The `test_scroll` function now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test the `scroll` method with multiple sets of input parameters in a more concise and readable way.


5. **Assertions:**  Assertions are added to validate the expected behavior of the methods (e.g., checking that `previous_url` is updated).  Crucially, for mocking, you will need to mock the method calls or check that the correct internal state has been updated, if the functions have side effects (like saving to a file).

6. **Error Handling (Important):**  For real `selenium` code, you'd need to add exception handling (e.g., `pytest.raises`) to check for specific exceptions.  In this mocked example, it's sufficient that no exceptions are raised. In a real test, you'd add checks for proper exception handling.

7. **Fixture for Mock:** The `mock_driver` fixture is now set up correctly.

**How to Use with Real Selenium (Example):**

If you want to test real `DriverBase` methods, you'd need to:
- Replace `MockDriverBase` with the actual `DriverBase` class.
- Install the `selenium` library.
- Create a suitable `webdriver` instance (e.g., `webdriver = webdriver.Chrome()`).
- Possibly use `@pytest.fixture` to manage the WebDriver creation for tests.

```python
import pytest
from selenium import webdriver

# ... (rest of your code)

@pytest.fixture
def webdriver_instance():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Or your WebDriver
    yield driver
    driver.quit()  # Always quit the driver after the test


def test_get_url_with_real_webdriver(webdriver_instance):
    # ... use the webdriver_instance
    try:
        webdriver_instance.get("https://www.example.com")
        # Assertions to check if the page loaded and content is present
    except Exception as e:
      pytest.fail(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

```

Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functionality of the `DriverBase` class you're testing.  Add more tests for other methods and consider more edge cases and exception handling. This improved example shows a structured approach to testing. Remember to adapt to your particular needs.
