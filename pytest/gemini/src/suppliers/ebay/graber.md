**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` and `Context` objects. This is crucial for isolating the tests from external dependencies (like actual webdrivers).

2. **Asyncio Tests:**  Tests for asynchronous functions (`__init__` which might eventually become async) are marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and use `await` correctly.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_graber_execute_locator_decorator_error_handling` now demonStartes proper error handling, catching exceptions within the decorator and asserting that the logger is called with an error message.  This tests a critical part of the code.

4. **Clearer Tests:** Test names are more specific and descriptive, making the test suite easier to understand.

5. **Decorator Testing:**  The `test_graber_execute_locator_decorator` tests the actual decorator logic, including checking if the mocked locator is called.

6. **No Locator Case:**  `test_graber_execute_locator_decorator_no_locator` ensures that the function runs correctly even if no locator is set.

7. **Fixture for Graber:** The `graber` fixture now sets up a `Graber` instance with the mocked `driver`.

8. **Import Corrections:**  Import statements are adjusted to the example code.

**How to Run:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the test code (e.g., `test_graber.py`) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_graber.py
   ```


This revised solution provides a significantly more robust and comprehensive test suite for the `Graber` class. Remember to adapt the imports to match your actual project structure if necessary.  Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual functions (if needed). Remember to add tests for any other functions or methods in your `graber.py` file. Remember to adapt the imports if necessary.
