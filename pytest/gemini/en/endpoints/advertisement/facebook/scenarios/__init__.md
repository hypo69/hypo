**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:**  The crucial addition is the `from ... import` statements.  You MUST import the functions (`login`, `switch_account`, etc.) from the actual file you want to test.  The example code above assumes you've done that.  Without these imports, your tests won't work.

2. **Realistic Test Cases:** The tests now have meaningful examples using hypothetical inputs for `login` and `switch_account`.  You must replace these placeholders with *actual* data and expected outputs/exceptions *relevant to the implementation in your file*.  Example assertions are given; those must be correct according to your code's expected behavior.

3. **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is correctly used to test for exceptions. The error messages should be tailored to match your specific exception handling in the functions you are testing.  For example, the error message in `test_login_invalid_credentials` and `test_switch_account_invalid_account` is *crucial*.  You need to ensure the error message matches the error message your function is *actually* raising.

4. **Clear Function Names:** The test names (`test_login_valid_credentials`, etc.) clearly describe the purpose of each test.

5. **Fixture Placeholder:** The `@pytest.fixture` example is there, but not used here because the code given didn't need any complex data preparation or setup.  If you need any initial data, define fixtures and use them for more complex test cases.


**How to run the tests:**

1. **Save the Test Code:** Save this Python file (e.g., `test_facebook_scenarios.py`) in a directory.
2. **Save the Source Code:** Save the Python file containing the `login` and `switch_account` function definitions from `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/scenarios` into a suitable location.  Make sure you can import it correctly.
3. **Run the Tests:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_facebook_scenarios.py`, and run `pytest test_facebook_scenarios.py`.

pytest will run the tests, reporting the results.  If any assertion fails, it will show you the specific test and how it differs from what your code expects. Remember to replace the example assertions with relevant ones for your code. Remember to include the actual implementations of your functions within a separate file or in the same file as the tests (if applicable).
