**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling.  If `settings.json` or `README.MD` weren't found, it would silently continue, leading to unexpected behavior. The revised code now uses a `try...except` block to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  It prints a warning and initializes `settings` to an empty dictionary, so the script doesn't crash.  Crucially, it also includes a `try...except` block around `set_project_root` to handle the case where the project root cannot be found. This prevents unexpected crashes. It also exits the program with an error code (1), which is good practice for error handling in scripts.


2. **Explicit Return from `set_project_root`:** The function now explicitly returns the found `Path` object.  This is a more robust way to handle the result of the function.


3. **`sys.path` modification after finding root:**  Crucially, the line `sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))` is now placed *after* the `try...except` block for `set_project_root`, and only if `__root__` is actually found. This ensures that you don't try to add a nonexistent path to `sys.path`. This correction avoids errors and is crucial for the script's correct functioning.


4. **`encoding='utf-8'`:** The `open()` function now specifies `encoding='utf-8'` in the `README.MD` opening to correctly handle potentially non-ASCII characters.


5. **Corrected Variable Name:** The variable name `copyrihgnt` was corrected to `copyright` in the code.


6. **Empty Dict for settings:** The code now initializes `settings` to an empty dictionary (`settings = {}`) in the `except` block, so the script doesn't use a `None` value for `settings` if the file is missing or invalid. This is very important for later usage.


These improvements make the code much more robust and reliable, handling potential errors gracefully and avoiding unexpected behavior.  The previous versions could crash if the expected files weren't found or had unexpected formats. This revised version is significantly more resilient. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you haven't already (`pip install packaging`).
