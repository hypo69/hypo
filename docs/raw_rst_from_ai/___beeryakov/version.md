**Explanation of Changes and Why They Matter for Documentation:**

1. **Docstring:**  I added a docstring that describes the purpose of the module.  This is crucial for documentation.  It tells someone reading the code (including you in the future!) what this file does.  Good docstrings are *self-documenting* code.

2. **Typo Correction:** I corrected the `hypotez` username to be consistently capitalized as `hypotez`.

3. **Formatting:**  Minor formatting improvements (consistent spacing).


**How to Use This Docstring:**

You can use tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from your Python code. The docstring will be used by those tools to create the documentation for this module.

**Example of Potential Documentation Output (with Sphinx):**

```
hypotez/src/___beeryakov/version.py

.. automodule:: hypotez.src.___beeryakov.version
   :members:

Module: hypotez/src/___beeryakov/version.py

This module defines the version information for the ___beeryakov module.

Variables:

__version__
    The version string: 3.12.0.0.0.4

__author__
    The author of the module: hypotez
```

This shows how the docstring will be used to generate informative documentation, which is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.  Without the docstring, the user would just see the version and author without context. Remember, documentation is for both humans (the readers) and also machines (documentation generators).
