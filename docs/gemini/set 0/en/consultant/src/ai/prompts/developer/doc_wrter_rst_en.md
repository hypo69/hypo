Module for code processing using an AI assistant.
=========================================================================================

This module contains the :class:`CodeProcessor` class, which utilizes various AI models,
such as Google Gemini and OpenAI, to handle code processing tasks.  It aims to provide a
structured and efficient way to process code files, incorporating robust error handling.

Example Usage

    processor.process_files(['file1.py', 'file2.py'])

# Changes Made

*   Added RST-style docstrings for the module, class, and `process_files` method.
*   Added a `_process_file` placeholder method.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (from `src.utils.jjson`).
*   Implemented error logging using `logger.error` for better error handling.
*   Added checks for file existence.  Raises `FileNotFoundError` if a file is not found.
*   Included basic error handling with `try-except` for file processing.  This is important for robust code!
*   Preserved existing comments where possible.
*   Improved comments for clarity and conciseness.
*   Added type hints for parameters.
