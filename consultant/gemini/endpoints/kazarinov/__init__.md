Code Style Issues:

1. **Unnecessary `__root__` variable assignments:**  The repeated `__root__ = current_path` and the assignment before the loop are redundant and don't add clarity.  Assign `__root__` directly inside the loop as you find the root.
2. **Inconsistent use of type hints:**  While you use type hints (`-> Path`) for the function, you don't use them for the `__root__` variables.
3. **Docstring improvements:** The docstrings are okay but could be more specific.  Explain what happens if no marker file is found.  Add an example use case.
4. **Missing `else` block in `get_project_root`:** If no marker file is found, the current directory is returned, but there's no explanation for this in the docstring.  Adding an `else` block to handle this would be better.

5. **Potential `IndexError` if `sys.path` is empty:** `sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))` will work, but if `sys.path` is empty or if a large number of paths have already been added, this could become a major concern.

6. **Redundant `__root__` variable:** The `__root__` variable is defined and assigned in the function `get_project_root()`, and then in the file itself. This is redundant.

7. **Global variable `__root__`:** The `__root__` variable should be defined within the `get_project_root` function for better encapsulation. It shouldn't be globally accessible.


Refactored Code:

import sys
from pathlib import Path
from packaging.version import Version


def get_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')) -> Path:
    """!
    Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory,
    searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.

    Args:
        marker_files (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.

    Returns:
        Path: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory
              where the script is located.  If no marker files are found
              anywhere along the parent directories, the current file's directory
              will be returned.

    current_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
            project_root = parent
            return project_root
    else:  # Handle the case where no marker files are found.
        return current_path  

# Get the root directory of the project
project_root = get_project_root()

# Important:  Now ensure the project root is in sys.path, but do it only if needed.
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Clearer `else` block:** Now the code explicitly handles the case where no marker file is found, returning the original directory.
* **Removed redundant `__root__` assignments:**  Assignments are moved inside the loop to reflect the finding of the root.
* **Encapsulated `__root__`:** The `__root__` variable now resides within the `get_project_root` function, improving code structure.
* **Conditional `sys.path` insertion:**  Checks if the project root is already in `sys.path` before adding it to avoid potential issues and improve efficiency.
* **Docstring improvement:** The docstring now explicitly states what happens if no marker file is found.


This revised code is more robust, efficient, and follows better Python coding practices.  It's crucial to handle the case where no marker file is found, or potential `IndexError` issues could arise. Remember to install the required libraries like `packaging` if you haven't already.
