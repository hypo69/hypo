**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code snippet from `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py`  only contains variable assignments and docstrings.  **There are no functions or classes to test.**  Therefore, the example test code is a placeholder.

To write meaningful tests, you need the actual functions or classes you want to test.  Provide the Python code containing the functions you want to test, and I'll generate appropriate test cases for them.

**Crucial Steps for Actual Testing:**

1. **Identify Functions/Classes:** Locate the functions and methods you want to test within the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py` file.
2. **Define Inputs:** Determine the valid, invalid, and edge-case input values for each function.
3. **Define Expected Outputs:** Establish the expected outcomes for each type of input (valid, invalid, edge case).
4. **Write Assertions:** Use `assert` statements in your test functions to compare the actual output of the function to the expected output. For exceptions, use `pytest.raises`.

**Example (Hypothetical):**

If the file contained a function like this:

```python
def calculate_price(price, discount_percentage):
    if discount_percentage < 0 or discount_percentage > 100:
        raise ValueError("Invalid discount percentage")
    return price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)
```

The corresponding tests would look like this:

```python
import pytest

def test_calculate_price_valid_input():
    price = 100
    discount_percentage = 10
    expected_price = 90
    assert calculate_price(price, discount_percentage) == expected_price

def test_calculate_price_invalid_discount():
    price = 100
    discount_percentage = -10
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid discount percentage"):
        calculate_price(price, discount_percentage)

def test_calculate_price_zero_discount():
    price = 100
    discount_percentage = 0
    expected_price = 100
    assert calculate_price(price, discount_percentage) == expected_price

def test_calculate_price_max_discount():
    price = 100
    discount_percentage = 100
    expected_price = 0
    assert calculate_price(price, discount_percentage) == expected_price
```

Provide the actual Python code, and I can create concrete and thorough tests for it.
