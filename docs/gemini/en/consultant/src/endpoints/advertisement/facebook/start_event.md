Module for starting Facebook event advertisement campaigns.

This module handles the initialization and continuous execution of event promotions
across various Facebook groups.  It leverages external data sources (JSON files)
for group selection and event configurations.

Example Usage:

    start_event_campaign()  # Function call to start the campaign

## Changes Made

*   Added missing import `time` for using `time.strftime` and `time.sleep`.
*   Replaced `filenames` with `group_file_paths` for better clarity.
*   Modified `excluded_filenames` to `excluded_group_files` for better clarity.
*   Added `event_names` for better naming consistency.
*   Added docstrings (reStructuredText) to the module, `start_event_campaign` function.
*   Replaced `d.get_url(...)` call within the `try` block in `start_event_campaign` function.
*   Improved variable naming for better readability and consistency.
*   Added a `start_event_campaign` function to encapsulate the main loop logic.
*   Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure the campaign starts only when the script is executed directly (not imported).
*   Added informative comments explaining the functionality and potential improvements.
*   Modified `promoter` initialization to make it more readable.
*   Improved logging messages by adding timestamps.
*   Added a `KeyboardInterrupt` handler to gracefully exit the loop.
*   Suggested handling of `d` (driver instance) for proper cleanup when interrupting.
*   Removed unnecessary `MODE` variable, as it's not used in the code.
*   Added a clear example of usage in the RST module documentation.
