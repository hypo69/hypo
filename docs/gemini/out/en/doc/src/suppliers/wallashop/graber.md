# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for collecting product fields from the `wallashop.co.il` website.  It inherits from the base `Graber` class and provides specific implementations for handling data extraction from the WallaShop website.  The class includes decorators for handling pop-up windows, allowing for customization and potential pre-execution actions.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class is responsible for gathering product data from the WallaShop website. It inherits from the base `Graber` class and overrides methods for specific WallaShop data handling.


**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` class, setting the `supplier_prefix` and initializing the base `Graber` class with the given driver.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The webdriver instance to interact with the website.


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: This asynchronous function gathers product data from the page using the provided driver.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The driver instance to interact with the website.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: A `ProductFields` object containing the collected product data.


## Functions

(No functions defined in the provided code outside of class methods)


##  Example Usage (IlluStartive):

```python
# Example of how to use the class
from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

# Initialize the driver (replace with your driver initialization code)
driver = Driver()

# Create a Graber instance (replace with your actual initialization values)
graber = Graber(driver)

try:
    # Grab product fields.  The 'id_product' key needs a value for this to work in the example
    fields = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='123')  # Example usage

    # Print the collected data
    print(fields)
except Exception as ex:
    print(f"An error occurred: {ex}")
finally:
    # Important: Close the driver after use
    await driver.close()
```

**Note:** The provided code snippet contains placeholder comments and incomplete implementations.  To complete the documentation, specific implementations for each of the `await self.X()` calls (e.g., `await self.name()`, `await self.description()`, etc.) need to be provided within the `fetch_all_data` function.  These methods are responsible for fetching data for various product fields.  Missing implementations prevent a complete and functional example.
