```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_supplier`, `mock_product_fields`, `mock_scenario_files`, and `mock_scenario` fixtures to properly isolate tests and avoid side effects.  Critically, these fixtures now use the `MockSupplier`, `MockRelatedModules`, and `MockDriver` classes from your example code, making the tests more realistic.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Instead of just checking for `True` or `False` return values, add more specific assertions to verify the expected behavior (e.g., `assert result is True`).

3. **Handling Failures (Crucial):** The `test_run_scenario_files_failure` test now demonstrates how to mock a failure.  In a real application, you'd need to mock the parts of the code that could cause failures, like failing file operations or API calls.

4. **Example `test_insert_grabbed_data`:** This test now has an empty assertion. In a real test, this would need a way to check if the insertion is successful. You'll need a mock for PrestaShop API calls (probably using `unittest.mock` or similar techniques) to actually test the `insert_grabbed_data` function properly. The same applies to other functions interacting with external systems.

5. **Asynchronous Tests:** The `test_execute_PrestaShop_insert_async` now correctly uses `async def` and `asyncio.run`.

6. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The provided tests now address a few examples and need significantly more for full coverage of the functions.  Add test cases for boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and edge cases to ensure robustness.

7. **Import Corrections:** Corrected import statements to properly access the classes and functions from the provided code.


**How to proceed for better testing:**

* **Mock External Dependencies:**  Use `unittest.mock` or other mocking libraries to create mock objects for `PrestaShop`, file handling, and any other external dependencies (e.g., database connections).  This is *essential* for testing functions that interact with external services.

* **Thorough Error Handling:** Test cases should explicitly handle exceptions and check for the correct types of exceptions raised under different conditions. Use `pytest.raises` to test exception scenarios.

* **Data-Driven Testing (if applicable):** If your scenarios have various input data, consider using parameterized tests (pytest.mark.parametrize) to create tests with different sets of data.

* **More Comprehensive Scenarios:** Design tests that cover the entire execution flow, including multiple functions and possible failures.


Remember to adapt the tests to the specific requirements and functionality of your actual code.  The above example is a starting point for creating a much more comprehensive and robust test suite. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `asyncio` etc.  Use `pip install pytest` if you haven't already.
