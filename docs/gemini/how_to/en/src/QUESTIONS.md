How to understand and use module-named configuration files (like `suppliers.json`) instead of a generic name (like `config.json`).

**Understanding the Purpose of Module-Named Configuration Files**

The code snippet shows a configuration file named `suppliers.json`.  This file likely contains settings specific to the "suppliers" module of the application.  Instead of a generic `config.json` file, using module-specific names (e.g., `suppliers.json`, `products.json`, `orders.json`) offers several advantages:

* **Improved Organization and Readability:**  The file name directly reflects the data it contains. This makes it clear which configuration settings are related to which part of the application. This is particularly helpful for larger applications with many interconnected modules.

* **Enhanced Code Maintainability:** When you need to find or modify settings for suppliers, you immediately know where to look (`suppliers.json`).  This reduces the time it takes to locate and modify specific configuration data.

* **Potential for Future AI Integration (as noted in the code):**  Using module-specific names can make it easier for AI models to understand the purpose and context of the configuration data.  This is because the file name clearly indicates the associated module or object.

**Using Module-Named Files Efficiently**

To work with configuration files named by module, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Module:** Determine which module or part of the application the configuration data relates to.

2. **Locate the File:**  The file will likely be located in a directory structure matching the module names. For example, if the module is named "suppliers," the file might be found in a directory structure similar to: `./config/suppliers.json`

3. **Load the File:** Use appropriate code (depending on your programming language) to load the configuration data from the JSON file.  This will likely involve using a JSON parsing library.  For example, in Python:

   ```python
   import json

   def load_config(module_name):
       file_path = f"./config/{module_name}.json"  # Construct the file path
       try:
           with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
               config_data = json.load(f)
               return config_data
       except FileNotFoundError:
           print(f"Error: Configuration file '{file_path}' not found.")
           return None
       except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
           print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")
           return None

   supplier_config = load_config("suppliers")

   if supplier_config:
       # Access and use the configuration data
       print(supplier_config)
   ```

4. **Access Configuration Data:** Use the loaded data to retrieve and use the specific settings relevant to that module.

**Example Configuration (`suppliers.json`)**

```json
{
  "supplier_list": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Acme Corp"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Beta Solutions"}
  ],
  "default_address": "123 Main St"
}
```

This detailed approach shows how to leverage module-specific configuration files for better organization, maintainability, and, importantly, AI integration. Remember to tailor the loading and usage code to your specific programming language and file structure.
