**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Additions:**

* **Mocking `j_loads_ns`:**  The original tests assumed that the `j_loads_ns` function would successfully load the data.  This was incomplete.  Now, the tests mock `j_loads_ns` to provide the expected data, preventing issues if the file reading fails.


* **Mocking `get_filenames`:**  Crucially, the `get_filenames` mock is added to `test_get_category_products_with_json_files`.  Without it, the test will try to access a file that might not exist, causing a `FileNotFoundError`.


* **Clearer `save_product` Test:** The `save_product` test is significantly improved. It now mocks `j_dumps` to avoid creating real files, and it checks if `Path.write_text` was called with the correct path and data, focusing on the relevant aspects.


* **Import `unittest.mock`:**  The code now imports `unittest.mock`, which is essential for modern mocking in Python, replacing the deprecated `mock` module.


* **`test_initialize_campaign`:**  Crucially checks if `j_loads_ns` was actually called (using `assert_called_once_with`). This is a strong check to ensure the mock is working correctly.


* **File Path Handling in `save_product`:**  Now correctly constructs the save path using the category name and product ID.  This is vital for the test to be robust.



These improvements make the tests more robust and reliable by explicitly handling potential file access issues and checking whether the mocked functions are called as expected. Remember to replace `"campaign_data.json"` with the actual filename if it's different in your code. Remember to adapt the file paths for your `Path` objects to the structure expected by your `AliPromoCampaign` class.
