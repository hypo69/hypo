How to use the amazon login function
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `login` that handles the login process for an Amazon account using a web driver.  It interacts with the web browser to navigate to the Amazon login page, fill in the email, password, and potentially other fields, and attempts to log in.  The function returns `True` if the login is successful and `False` otherwise.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `logger` module, presumably for logging messages during the login process.

2. **Define the `login` function:** This function takes a `Supplier` object (`s`) as input, which likely contains the necessary information and tools for interacting with the web browser (e.g., driver, locators).

3. **Get locators and driver:**  It retrieves the login locators (`_l`) from the `s.locators_store` dictionary (presumably containing web element identifiers for various login form fields).  It also gets the web driver object (`_d`) from the `s` object.

4. **Navigate to Amazon login page:** The web driver navigates to the Amazon login page (`https://amazon.com/`).

5. **Click on the login button:** The code attempts to click on the element identified by the `open_login_inputs` locator.  If this fails, it attempts a refresh and then tries clicking it again.  Error handling is incorporated to detect alternative locations of the button should the original be unavailable.

6. **Fill login form elements:** The code attempts to fill in the required fields in the login form, accessing inputs with locators.   If any of these field inputs fail to be located, the function proceeds to the next step.

7. **Handle form submissions:** The code executes logic associated with each form element (like `email_input`, `continue_button`, `password_input`, `keep_signed_in_checkbox`, `success_login_button`). The code anticipates potential errors during each form element handling.

8. **Check for login success:**  The code checks the current URL of the web driver. If it's still the Amazon login page, it logs an error indicating unsuccessful login.  Error handling is anticipated to perform further actions in case of failure.

9. **Maximize window and log successful login:** If the login succeeds (URL changes), the web driver maximizes the browser window and logs a success message.

10. **Return success/failure:** The function returns `True` to indicate a successful login and `False` otherwise.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from . import login  # Assuming login.py is in the same directory
    from .supplier import Supplier # Import Supplier class

    # Assuming you have a Supplier object
    supplier_obj = Supplier(...)

    # Call the login function
    success = login(supplier_obj)

    if success:
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Login failed.")
