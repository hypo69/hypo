**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **File Reading in Each Test:** The `test_proxy_list_*` functions now read the file `proxies.txt` directly within each test, which is a more robust approach for large files.  This avoids storing the entire file in memory as a fixture.

2. **Empty Line Handling:** `test_proxy_list_no_empty_lines` explicitly checks for and fails if any empty lines exist, which was a potential problem in the original data format.

3. **Validation:** `test_proxy_list_valid_format` validates the format.  Crucially, it now checks for _non-empty_ lines and uses a regular expression to verify the scheme (`socks5://`, `socks4://`, or `http://`) and that the host and port are properly formatted.

4. **Minimum Proxy Check:** `test_proxy_list_has_at_least_one_proxy` checks that the file has at least one valid proxy.

5. **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages now provide more context when a proxy string is in the incorrect format, making debugging easier.

6. **Focus on Core Functionality:** The tests are now specifically designed to test the *format* of the proxy strings, which is the main goal indicated by the code structure and data itself.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_proxies.py`).
2. Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_proxies.py`

This improved test suite is more robust and provides more comprehensive coverage of the proxy data's correctness.  Important:  The regular expressions are *crucial* to validate the data accurately since the data contains many, many different proxy strings. Note: The data is extremely large, so pytest performance will be a factor.  Better data handling could improve the test suite.
