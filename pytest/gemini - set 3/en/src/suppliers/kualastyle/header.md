```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly indicate the conditions being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_marker_in_parent_directory`).

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The test `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file` correctly uses `pytest.raises` to verify that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised when a non-existent file is specified.

3. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** This is crucial for creating temporary files and directories without affecting the actual file system. The `create_dummy_files` fixture is modified to use `tmp_path` to create the files in a temporary directory, preventing potential interference with other tests or the project's actual files.

4. **Edge Case Testing:**  Tests now cover cases like when the marker file is in a parent directory and when no marker files are found in the current directory.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added tests for various scenarios, including empty `marker_files` tuple.

6. **Import Statements:**  Included the necessary `os` and `pathlib` imports for working with file paths.

7. **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings for the tests for better readability and understanding.

8. **Correct Filepath:** Ensured the correct use of `create_dummy_files` within the test functions.

9. **Correct Handling of `sys.path`:** The tests now ensure that the project root is added to `sys.path` correctly when found.


This revised solution is more robust, covers more edge cases, and is better structured for maintainability. Remember to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/test_header.py
```
(Make sure you create a `test_header.py` file and place the above code in it.) This assumes your test file is in the `hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle` directory.  Adjust the path accordingly if your test file is elsewhere. Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with the actual name of your project directory if needed.
