**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock `Driver` and `Context`. This is vital for testing the `Graber` class without needing a real webdriver or complex setup.

2. **`asyncio.run()`:** The `asyncio.run()` is now used correctly to execute the `grab_page` coroutine, which is essential for asynchronous code testing.

3. **`fetch_all_data` Mocking:**  This is a *critical* addition. The original test didn't handle the fact that `fetch_all_data` calls other functions within the `Graber` class.   Instead of mocking every single function call, the `fetch_all_data` fixture now *stubs* the internal `fetch_all_data` to prevent errors during testing.

4. **`ProductFields` Initialization:**  It initializes `graber.fields` to `ProductFields()` to prevent errors related to it not being defined.

5. **Specific Exception Handling:** The `test_grab_page_missing_id_product` test now demonstrates how to check for a specific type of exception (e.g., `AttributeError`). A more robust exception test in `test_grab_page_internal_exception` is included showing proper exception handling. The simulated error is specific to the `name` method, showcasing how to handle internal exceptions.



**How to Use:**

1.  Install `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
    ```
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_graber.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Real WebDriver Interaction (if needed):** The provided tests use mocking. If you *need* real WebDriver interaction for specific tests, you would remove the mocking and use a real `Driver` instance and proper setup. 
* **`ProductFields` handling:** The tests now assume `ProductFields` is a class that you've defined. If not, you need to define it as a class.
* **Context:** The mocking is generalized to `context_mock`, which should contain all the values of the `Context`. If necessary, include all necessary mocks for the `Context`.
* **Assertions:** The test for `test_grab_page_valid_input` now checks if `graber.fields` is set after the run of the `fetch_all_data`. Consider adding more specific assertions to ensure correct data gathering. You should examine each of the methods called inside `fetch_all_data` (e.g., `graber.id_product`) and verify that they are called as expected.


This improved solution provides a more realistic and robust way to test asynchronous code using `pytest` and `asyncio`, covering various scenarios, including valid input, missing data, and exceptions. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with appropriate assertions to check the exact values returned by the functions.
