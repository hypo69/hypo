**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, cases where "hypotez" isn't found, edge cases like the root directory, and importantly, cases where an empty string or single character directory is used.  This addresses potential errors that the previous version might have missed.


* **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to correctly handle and assert on the `ValueError` that can occur if "hypotez" isn't in the path.


* **Clearer Test Descriptions:** The docstrings for each test function clearly explain the purpose and the expected behavior.


* **Realistic Data:** The test data (`test_cwd`) now uses more realistic path representations.


* **Proper Setup and Teardown:** The tests now manipulate the current working directory (`os.chdir`) but also reset it (`os.chdir("/")`) and `sys.path.clear()` after each test to prevent interference between tests.


* **Import Checks:** The test `test_import_sys_os` and `test_import_pathlib` explicitly check that the required modules can be imported.  This is critical for robustness, since missing modules would cause the test itself to fail.


This revised solution provides more comprehensive and robust testing for the provided code. Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing the test file and the Python code you want to test. Remember to replace `/home/user/hypotez` with an actual path to the hypotez directory for your system.  If this path does not exist, you'll need to adapt the test cases to ensure they are run from a directory that does have the hypotez project.
