module: src.db.manager_translations._examples

This module provides example functions and classes for managing translations.
It's located in the `_examples` subdirectory to clearly distinguish example code
from production code.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Corrected `dir_root` calculation:** The original code had a potential `IndexError`. The corrected calculation now precisely locates the `hypotez` directory and is less error-prone.  It uses `os.getcwd().rfind('hypotez') + 7` to handle varying directory structures. The +7 is crucial because we need to include the characters from the index to the end of hypotez in the root directory.
* **Clearer docstrings:** Added more descriptive docstrings explaining the purpose of the module and why it's located in `_examples`. This is crucial for documentation.
* **Corrected `__init__` import:** Changed `from __init__ import gs` to the correct path `from src.__init__ import gs` to avoid ambiguity.
* **Explicit relative imports:**  Import statements now use `from src.your_module import your_class` instead of relative imports.  This improves maintainability and reduces the chance of import errors.
* **`dir_src` usage:** Instead of appending `dir_root` twice to `sys.path`, we use it to create the correct `dir_src` path and add *that* to the `sys.path`.
* **Pathlib consistency:** The code now consistently uses `Path` objects for constructing file paths, which is more Pythonic and less error-prone compared to string manipulation.
* **PEP 8 compliance:** Minor formatting changes to comply with PEP 8 style guide (e.g., better spacing around colons, etc.).
* **Removed redundant import:** The `import re` is now commented out since it's not immediately used.


By making these changes, the code is more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.  This is vital for any project, especially when working with complex codebases.  The added `# --- Import necessary modules from the project ---` comment block helps organize imports in large files. Remember to replace `...` with the rest of your code. Remember to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running if needed.
