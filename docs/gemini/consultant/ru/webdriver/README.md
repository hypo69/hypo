**Changes Made**

- Replaced `chrome_driver._save_cookies()` with `chrome_driver._save_cookies_locally()`.
- Added `try...except` block to catch and log exceptions. This is crucial for robust error handling.
- Changed all `if` conditions in examples to also include `else` blocks for logging errors.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) for the `main` function, explaining the purpose and actions.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `_save_cookies_locally` for better clarity).
- Added `TODO` notes for areas that may need further enhancement.  (Not applicable in this example, but it's a best practice to document improvements and further steps.)
