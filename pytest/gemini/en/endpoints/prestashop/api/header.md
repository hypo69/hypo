```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to mock `Path.exists` for more controlled testing of file existence. This is crucial for avoiding external dependencies that might affect test results.

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The tests now include cases for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings and readme loading.

3. **Clearer Fixture Usage:** Fixtures are used more effectively for creating mock files and project roots.

4. **Specific Test Cases:**  Tests are crafted to address different edge cases, especially related to file existence and JSON parsing failures.

5. **File Existence in `mock_gs_path`:**  The `mock_gs_path` fixture now correctly sets up the directories needed for the mock files, making the tests more robust.

6. **Using `tmp_path` from pytest:**  This is used instead of creating files in the project root directory, which is better for test isolation.

7. **`__root__` used correctly:** I modified the test to ensure we are accessing the `__root__` property correctly as expected in the original code.

8. **Removed unused variables:** Some unnecessary variables are removed, making the code more concise.

9. **Added `mock_readme_file` fixture:** This fixture allows mocking of `README.MD`.



This revised solution provides more robust and comprehensive testing coverage, addressing potential issues and edge cases. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging`).  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your project environment.  Also make sure to replace `hypotez` with the actual name of your project to prevent errors. Remember to adjust the test paths according to your project structure.
