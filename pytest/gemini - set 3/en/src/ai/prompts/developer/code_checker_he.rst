```text
- Tests added for the calculate_sum function, covering various scenarios: valid inputs, empty lists, single-element lists, mixed types, and non-list input.
- `pytest.raises` used for exception handling.
- Test function names are clear and descriptive.
- Test cases are isolated and independent.
-  Edge cases (empty list, single element) are covered.
- Tests for float inputs have been added.
