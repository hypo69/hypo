## Changes Made

- Added missing imports for `j_loads_ns`, `logger`, `Path`, and potentially `gs` (likely a custom library for Google Drive access).  
- Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings for the module, `process_campaign_category`, `process_campaign`, `process_all_campaigns`, and `get_directory_names` to improve readability and help with documentation generation.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads_ns` for reading JSON files, aligning with the specified requirement.
- Added error handling using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error` to log errors appropriately.  Removed unnecessary `...` placeholders where the code could be more complete.
- Changed variable name from `campaigns_directory` to `campaign_directory` to better follow naming conventions and clarity.
- Added a `get_directory_names` function stub with error handling that shows how to deal with directory errors, as well as a potential implementation.
- Included examples for usage of the functions.  Crucially, example usage is now inside the docstrings and is well-documented.
