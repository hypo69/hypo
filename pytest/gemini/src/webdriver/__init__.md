#This would be very different if driver was a class or there were more functions and classes
# The tests above are placeholders for actual unit tests. You should replace them 
# with tests that directly verify the behavior of the functions, classes, and 
# methods that are defined in the code you are testing.  
#  Consider the contents of your files hypotez/src/webdriver/driver.py, hypotez/src/webdriver/chrome.py, etc
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The code now correctly imports the necessary variables from the `hypotez.src.webdriver` module.

2. **Specific Tests:** The examples now provide concrete tests, like verifying the `MODE` variable has the correct value.  If actual functions/classes existed in the `webdriver` module, tests would cover their behavior.

3. **Error Handling:** The tests now include checks for the variable being `None`.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions now use `f-strings` to give more informative error messages in case of failures.

5. **Example Tests (commented):**  I've commented out example tests for when there are classes and methods in the `webdriver` module (e.g., checking if the `Chrome` class has a `driver` attribute) because the provided initial code does not define any.  These placeholders illustrate how to test different aspects of the codebase.

**Crucially:** The provided input code (`webdriver/__init__.py`) only declares a variable (`MODE`).  **No functions or classes are defined**, so there's nothing to test other than this global variable.  If there were functions or classes, tests would need to be tailored to those elements.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_webdriver.py`) in a directory that's on your PYTHONPATH or create a `test_` folder in the same directory as `webdriver/__init__.py` and put the test file there.
2.  Run pytest from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_webdriver.py
    ```

If the code being tested is part of a larger package (`hypotez/src/webdriver`) ensure that the directory is in your PYTHONPATH or that you run pytest from the directory containing the `hypotez/src` folder.  Otherwise, you'll get import errors.
