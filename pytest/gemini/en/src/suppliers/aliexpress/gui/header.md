**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses mocking to isolate the tests and avoid external dependencies (like `sys` and `os`).  Crucially, mocking `sys.path.append` prevents unintended side effects.

2. **Error Handling:**  The `test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez` test now includes `pytest.raises` to check for the `IndexError` that should occur if `hypotez` isn't in the path. This is a critical edge case.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, explicitly stating the purpose of each test.

4. **Fixtures:** Fixtures (`patched_sys`, `patched_os`) are used to control the environment for testing, which significantly improves the test cases' isolation and robustness.

5. **Realistic Mocks:** The mock values now better reflect what a real application would do, e.g. simulating that `os.getcwd` returns the current directory.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage:** While the original code was quite basic, the tests now cover a broader range of potential scenarios, including the crucial error condition where "hypotez" is not found in the path.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2. Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved test suite will provide better confidence in the correctness and robustness of your `header.py` code. Remember to adapt the mock values in the tests to reflect your expected input data.  If other parts of the `header.py` depend on `sys` and `os`, appropriate mocks would need to be added in a similar way.
