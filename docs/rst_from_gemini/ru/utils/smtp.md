SMTP Email Interface

This module provides functionality to send and receive emails using an SMTP or IMAP server.
It includes functions to send emails using SMTP and retrieve emails using IMAP.

Functions:
    - `send(subject: str = '', body: str = '', to: str = 'one.last.bit@gmail.com') -> bool`
      Sends an email using the SMTP server specified in the `_connection` dictionary.  Returns `True` on success, `False` on failure.  Includes error logging.  Handles potential errors during SMTP interaction more robustly.

    - `receive(imap_server: str, user: str, password: str, folder: str = 'inbox') -> Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]]`
      Retrieves emails from an IMAP server and returns them as a list of dictionaries.  Returns `None` on error. Includes error logging.  Handles potential issues with email structure, including missing headers and encoding errors.


** Important Considerations for Security and Robustness **:

    - **_connection Dictionary:** Do *not* hardcode credentials in this file.  Move the `_connection` dictionary to environment variables (e.g., using `os.environ`).  This is crucial for security.  Avoid storing passwords directly in source code.

    - **Error Handling:** The code includes robust error handling, logging exceptions with details (subject, body, etc.).  This is very helpful for debugging.  Error handling now includes checks for missing keys in the email message.

    - **Email Parsing:** The `receive` function handles various email formats gracefully, preventing potential issues, particularly with missing headers and character encoding.

    - **MIME Handling:**  The code correctly uses `MIMEText` for constructing the email message, crucial for sending basic text emails.
    - **Email Subject/Body Handling:**  The code now handles cases where the subject or body might be missing.

```

**Improvements:**

* **Security:** The code now uses `smtp.send_message` which is more secure than `smtp.sendmail` for sending messages.
* **Robustness:**  Improved error handling, particularly in the `receive` function to catch and log issues with decoding email bodies, and check for missing subject/body/from headers.
* **Clarity:** The docstrings have been updated to be more specific and accurate. The `MODE` variable is removed as it's unused.  Variables are assigned reasonable default values, preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Efficiency:** The `receive` function now gracefully handles potential issues with email body decoding to avoid the program crashing.


This revised code is significantly more robust and secure, handling a wider variety of potential email issues and adhering to best practices for email handling. Remember to replace the placeholder environment variables with your actual credentials. Remember to install the required libraries (`smtplib`, `imaplib`, `email`) if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install smtplib imaplib email
```
