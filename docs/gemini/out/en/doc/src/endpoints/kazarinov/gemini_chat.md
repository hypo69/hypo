# hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/gemini_chat.py

## Overview

This module handles model training and dialog generation for the Kazarinov project using GoogleGenerativeAI. It defines a `KazarinovAI` class for interacting with the model, including training, question-answering, and dialog functionalities.  It also includes a `chat` function to initiate a chat session with the AI assistant.


## Classes

### `KazarinovAI`

**Description**: This class handles model training and dialog generation for the Kazarinov project using GoogleGenerativeAI. It manages model initialization, training, question answering, and dialog interactions.

**Attributes**:

- `api_key`: The API key for the GoogleGenerativeAI model.
- `base_path`: The base path for system instructions and training files.
- `system_instruction_list`: A list of system instructions read from files in the specified base path.
- `history_file`: The file path to store the chat history.
- `gemini_1`, `gemini_2`: Instances of the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class, used for model interactions.
- `timestamp`:  A timestamp to identify the current run.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `KazarinovAI` object.

**Parameters**:

- `system_instruction` (str, optional): Instruction for the model's system role. Defaults to None.
- `generation_config` (dict | list[dict], optional): Configuration for content generation. Defaults to `{"response_mime_type": "text/plain"}`.

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there is an issue reading system instruction files.

#### `train`

**Description**: Trains the model using the provided list of training files, sending data in chunks of specified size.

**Parameters**:

- `train_files` (list | str): A list or single file name for training.

**Raises**:


#### `question_answer`

**Description**: Handles the question-answering process using the provided training files.

**Parameters**:

- `train_files` (list | str): A list or single file name for training questions.

#### `dialog`

**Description**: Runs a dialog based on pre-defined questions, shuffling questions from different languages.


#### `ask`

**Description**: Asks a question to the AI assistant.

**Parameters**:

- `q` (str): The question to ask.
- `no_log` (bool, optional):  Whether to suppress logging. Defaults to False.
- `with_pretrain` (bool, optional): Whether to use pretraining data. Defaults to True.

**Returns**:

- bool: True if the request was successful.


### `chat`

**Description**: Initiates a chat session with the AI assistant, Kazarinov.

**Parameters**: None

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there is an issue reading system instruction files.


## Functions

There are no additional functions beyond the class methods in this file.


## Notes

- The code utilizes external libraries like `header`, `time`, `json`, `random`, `typing`, `pathlib`, `gs`, `OpenAIModel`, `GoogleGenerativeAI`, `get_filenames`, `read_text_file`, `recursively_read_text_files`, `recursively_get_filepath`, `j_dumps`, `pprint`, and `logger`.  Their specific functionality is not documented here, assuming they are well-documented elsewhere.
- The code includes significant logic for handling data chunking during training (`train` method).
- The `chat` function implements a simple command-line interface for interacting with the AI.
- The `dialog` method demonStartes a more interactive approach involving question shuffling.
