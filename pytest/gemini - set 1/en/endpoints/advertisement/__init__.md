# If there are specific methods/classes within Facebook, you would add tests here.

# @pytest.mark.skip(reason="Facebook module is empty, needs mocked class or data")
# def test_facebook_get_ad_data():
#     """
#     Tests a hypothetical 'get_ad_data' method in the Facebook class.  
#     (Needs mocked Facebook class or sample data for this to work)
#     """
#     fb = Facebook()
#     # Replace with expected data or mock depending on how Facebook is implemented
#     result = fb.get_ad_data("ad_id_123")
#     assert result == {"ad_id": "ad_id_123", "data": "some_ad_info"} 
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Empty Module:** The provided code only imports a module (`Facebook`), but doesn't define any classes or methods within it.  The test cases now reflect this by only testing if the module itself imports correctly and is not `None`.  
2. **Mocking or Stubbing:** To test actual methods within the `Facebook` class, you need to either:
   - **Mock the Facebook class:** Use a mocking library (like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to create a fake `Facebook` class with predefined behavior. This is the preferred method for testing if code interacts correctly with external systems or services.
   - **Stub the Facebook class (if possible):** If the Facebook code only interacts with external services, you may be able to stub these interactions within your tests using an approach that effectively replaces the external call with a controlled return. 
   - **Provide sample data:** If possible, create sample data for `Facebook` methods to test them without needing a real external connection.  You can create a `Facebook` class with dummy methods that return test data instead of connecting to Facebook's API directly.

3. **Missing `Facebook` Class:** The tests are adjusted to reflect the fact that `Facebook` itself may not have methods in the current state of the provided code.  
4. **Error Handling (Important):** If `Facebook` contained methods that could raise exceptions (e.g., `APIError` or similar), you would need test cases that handle those exceptions.  These would use `pytest.raises` to check that the appropriate exceptions are raised under particular conditions.  This is a crucial component missing from the test cases here.

**How to Run the Tests:**

Make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Save the test code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_advertisement.py`).  Then run pytest from the command line in the same directory:

```bash
pytest test_advertisement.py
```

**Example for a Mocked Facebook Class (if needed):**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement import Facebook, MODE


# Mocking the Facebook class
@pytest.fixture
def mocked_facebook():
    mocked_fb = Mock()
    mocked_fb.get_ad_data.return_value = {"ad_id": "ad_id_123", "data": "some_ad_info"}
    return mocked_fb


def test_facebook_get_ad_data_mocked(mocked_facebook):
    fb = Facebook(mocked_facebook)  # Inject the mock
    result = fb.get_ad_data("ad_id_123")
    assert result == {"ad_id": "ad_id_123", "data": "some_ad_info"}
    mocked_facebook.get_ad_data.assert_called_once_with("ad_id_123")
```

This example shows how you can create a `mocked_facebook` fixture and use it to create a `Facebook` instance.  This allows for testing the methods of the `Facebook` class without actually calling the external service.   Adapt this structure based on the actual `Facebook` class and its method signatures. Remember to install `pytest-mock` if you are using the `@patch` approach.
