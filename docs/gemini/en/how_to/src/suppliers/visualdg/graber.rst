How to use the Graber class for VisualDG product data extraction
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `Graber` for extracting product data from the `visualdg.co.il` website.  It inherits from the `Grbr` class (presumably a base class for web scraping) and handles specific data extraction tasks for fields on the product page.  The `Graber` class provides functions to fetch data for various product attributes.  It allows for custom handling of specific fields by overriding functions in the parent class. The class also incorporates asynchronous operations for efficiency and manages potential pop-up window closures.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The `Graber` class is instantiated with a `Driver` object, which likely represents a web browser driver. This driver object is crucial for interacting with the webpage.

2. **Setting up global configuration (optional):** The code sets `Context.locator_for_decorator` to `None`. This variable, if set to a specific locator, will be used by a decorator (commented out) to potentially perform actions (e.g., closing pop-up windows) before other data extraction functions.

3. **Asynchronous data extraction:** The `grab_page` method fetches product data asynchronously. This method uses a helper function, `fetch_all_data`.

4. **Calling individual attribute functions:** Inside `fetch_all_data`,  functions like `id_product`, `description_short`, `name`, and numerous other functions are called to extract various product attribute values.  Each attribute function (e.g., `id_product`) interacts with the web driver via the parent `Grbr` class's functionality. The `kwards` dictionary allows passing specific IDs.

5. **Assembling data:** All the extracted data is combined into the `self.fields` object.

6. **Returning data:** The `grab_page` method returns the `ProductFields` object containing the extracted data. This data structure is expected to hold the product data.

7. (Optional) **Pop-up handling (if decorator is used):** The commented-out code defines a `close_pop_up` decorator that could potentially close pop-up windows before each function call.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.visualdg.graber import Graber  # Replace with actual path if needed

    # Assuming you have a Driver object (e.g., from a webdriver library)
    driver = Driver(...)

    try:
        graber = Graber(driver)
        product_data = asyncio.run(graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='123')) # Replace 123 with a product ID.
        # Process the product_data object.
        print(product_data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    # Close the driver (Crucial!)
    await driver.close()
