**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Dummy `DiscordBot` class:**  Crucially, I've created a placeholder `DiscordBot` class. Replace this with your actual bot code when you have it.  This makes the tests work without needing to run your Discord bot.
* **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are descriptive and follow the example format.
* **Exception Handling:** `test_train_invalid_data` and `test_test_invalid_json` demonstrate how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
* **Valid Input Tests:** Tests for valid data input are present for training (`test_train_text_data`, `test_train_file`).
* **Invalid/Unexpected Input Tests:** Tests for incorrect data types (`test_train_invalid_data`) and invalid JSON (`test_test_invalid_json`) are added.
* **Edge Cases:**  `test_ask_invalid_question` demonstrates testing an unexpected question.
* **Fixture:** A `bot` fixture is introduced to manage instantiation.
* **JSON Handling:** The `test_method` tests now properly load JSON input and handles potential JSONDecodeErrors.
* **`assert` Statements:**  Tests have appropriate `assert` statements to verify the expected results.
* **Complete example cases:** Tests added for the `archive` and `select_dataset` commands.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace:**  Substitute your actual `DiscordBot` class into the test file.
2.  **Run:** Execute `pytest` in your terminal to run the tests.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and complete set of tests covering various aspects of the code. Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific functionality of your actual code.  Crucially, you need to populate your example training data to make the tests actually do something useful.
