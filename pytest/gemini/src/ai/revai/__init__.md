**Explanation and Important Considerations for Real Tests:**

1. **Replace the Example:** The provided code has no functions, so example tests for `add_numbers` were added.  Replace the example function and tests with your actual functions and corresponding test cases.  Make sure your tests directly test the logic of your functions.

2. **`pytest.raises`:** The example uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions like `TypeError` when inappropriate inputs are passed.

3. **Fixtures:** If your functions require data for testing (like a database connection or configuration), define fixtures.  The example uses a `sample_data` fixture.

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests cover various input types, including zero, negative, float, and string values for inputs. The example also tests various scenarios that could cause an error.  You need to identify the relevant input types and conditions for *your* functions.

5. **Edge Cases:** Look for edge or boundary conditions specific to your functions (e.g., empty lists, very large numbers, files at the limits of file system size).

6. **Error Handling:**  Crucially, test how your functions handle errors.  This often means using `pytest.raises` to check if the correct exceptions are raised when invalid or inappropriate data is passed as input.

7. **Clear Test Names:**  Give your test function names that clearly indicate what they are testing (e.g., `test_function1_valid_input`, `test_function2_edge_case_with_large_number`).

8. **Isolate Tests:**  Make sure each test function is independent and doesn't rely on the results of other tests.  This is crucial for reliable testing.

9. **`assert` Statements:**  Use `assert` statements to verify the expected output of your functions based on the provided inputs.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the code above (with your actual functions and tests) as a Python file (e.g., `test_revai.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_revai.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.

Remember to replace the example code with the actual code from `hypotez/src/ai/revai/__init__.py` to generate meaningful tests. If you have complex logic or data, you may need to create more elaborate test data using fixtures.
