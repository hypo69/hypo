Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files,
as well as retrieving video data.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Raises
        exceptions for invalid URLs or network issues.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Returns None if the file
        does not exist or there is an error reading it.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')

    >>> video_data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if video_data:
    ...     print(video_data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes
    ...
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'  # Example output (will depend on the actual video)

```

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added more robust error handling.  The `save_video_from_url` function now catches `aiohttp.ClientError` specifically for network issues, and a general `except Exception` block provides a more comprehensive fallback for other potential errors. Crucially, it checks if the file actually exists after the download attempt.  This prevents false positives when the download is interrupted.  The `get_video_data` function also now handles potential read errors properly.
* **Explicit Error Messages:**  Provides more informative error messages to the user and logs, including the specific error type.
* **Clearer Docstrings:** Improved docstrings with more details, examples, and explanations of potential return values and exceptions.
* **Removed Redundant Check:** Removed the size check for 0 bytes. If a file is not downloaded correctly, it won't be 0 bytes, but will fail the existence check.

* **Example Usage in `if __name__ == "__main__":`:** Included an example usage within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block using a sample URL for a different file type (svg).  This makes the code more testable and shows how to use the functions.


This revised solution addresses the issues in the original code, making it more robust and usable.  Remember to replace `"https://example.com/video.mp4"` with a valid video URL for testing.


**Before running:**

1.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install aiohttp aiofiles
    ```
2.  If you are using a virtual environment, make sure you activate it before running the script.
3.  Import `asyncio` when using the `save_video_from_url` function in another module or script. Example: `import asyncio` at the top of the file using this function.
