**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Fixtures:** Added `project_root_with_files` and `project_root_without_files` fixtures to create controlled test environments, avoiding reliance on the project's actual structure.

2.  **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, explicitly stating the input conditions.

3.  **Edge Case Testing:** Included tests for scenarios where no marker files are found and cases where the marker file is nested within the directory structure.  This ensures robustness.

4. **Error Handling:** Added tests that verify the handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings file reading.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover both successful and failed scenarios for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`. The failure scenarios are crucial for ensuring the code handles potential issues gracefully.

6. **Robustness:** Added a test case where no marker files exist in the current directory, which is a valid scenario that the original code should handle without raising an error.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as `header.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution provides more thorough and reliable test cases for the `set_project_root` function, improving the overall quality and reliability of the code. Remember to adapt the `tmp_path` fixture usage to align with your specific test setup and import requirements. Also, adjust the `marker_files` argument values based on the actual naming convention you'll be using.
