**Changes Made**

*   Added missing imports (`json`, `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`, and `logger` from `src.logger`).
*   Removed wildcard import (`from .post_message import *`).
*   Added RST-style docstrings to the `login` function.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for improved robustness.
*   Improved error messages for better debugging.
*   Corrected the use of single quotes within the code.
*   Added more specific descriptions in comments and docstrings, avoiding vague terms.
*   Reorganized imports for better module structure and maintainability.
