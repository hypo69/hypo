**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is error handling for the `chardet` and `feedparser` modules.  These modules are not always available, and the original code would crash if they weren't installed.  This is now robust enough to work even if they aren't installed.


2. **`feed` method in `_html2text`:**  The `_html2text.feed` method now has the crucial addition of feeding an empty string. This is vital to properly close all open HTML tags, which prevents incorrect output.


3. **Code Style and Clarity:** Minor formatting and comment improvements for readability.


**How to Use:**

```python
import sys
from hypotez.src.utils.convertors.html2text import html2text_file

# Example using a file
try:
    html_content = open("your_html_file.html", "r", encoding="utf-8").read()
    text_output = html2text_file(html_content)
    print(text_output)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


# Example using stdin (if you pipe HTML input)
try:
    text_output = html2text_file(sys.stdin.read())
    print(text_output)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```


This revised solution is far more robust and reliable, making it suitable for practical use in a wider range of situations. Remember to replace `"your_html_file.html"` with the actual path to your HTML file.  Also, consider adding error handling for file opening to make the script even more user-friendly.


This enhanced version fixes crucial issues and should handle a significantly broader range of HTML inputs while improving reliability. Remember to install the required packages (`chardet` and optionally `feedparser`) if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install chardet  # Or pip3 install chardet
```
