How to use the `version.py` file

This guide explains how to use the `hypotez/src/product/_examples/version.py` file, focusing on understanding its variables and their intended purpose.

**File Overview:**

The file `version.py` defines several variables crucial for managing version information and potential metadata about a module or package.  It's important to note the extensive use of docstrings, though they're not optimally formatted or consistently used.  This can lead to issues in understanding the intended purpose of specific variables.

**Key Variables and Their Potential Uses:**

* **`__version__`:** This variable stores the version string of the module or package.  In this case, the value is `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`.  This format is unusual and might need adjustment for consistency with other versions in the project.

* **`__name__`:**  This variable contains the name of the module.  Crucially, when the script is run directly (e.g., `python version.py`), `__name__` will be set to `"__main__"`.  This allows you to distinguish between when the module is being imported and when it's being executed.


* **`__doc__`:** This variable contains the module's documentation string. However, the current docstrings are not well-formatted and are not following a consistent standard.

* **`__details__`:** This variable seems to store supplementary information about the version, module, or class. The value is currently set to `"Details about version for module or class"`.  Consider a more descriptive string for clearer context.

* **`__annotations__`:**  This variable is currently empty (`__annotations__`).  This means no type hints are defined for any functions or variables within the file.

* **`__author__`:** This string likely contains the author's name(s).  The value is `'hypotez'`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Docstring Consistency:** The multiline docstrings are repeated and often lack the proper structure for Sphinx-style documentation.  Fix them to align with standard Python docstrings.

* **Versioning Scheme:** The version string `3.12.0.0.0.4` is unusual. Consider a more standard versioning scheme (e.g., Semantic Versioning) to improve consistency and clarity.

* **Purpose of `MODE`:**  The `MODE = 'dev'` variable is present, but its usage isn't described.  Add a clear explanation of what it represents.



**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
import version  # Import the module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Version: {version.__version__}")
    print(f"Module Name: {version.__name__}")
    print(f"Author: {version.__author__}")
```

This example demonstrates how to access the variables defined in the `version.py` file.  When run directly, this code would output the version, module name, and author information.

**Further Recommendations:**

1.  Adopt a consistent versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning).
2.  Improve docstrings for better readability and clarity.
3.  Define clear purposes for variables like `MODE`.


By addressing these points, the `version.py` file will be more robust, readable, and maintainable.
