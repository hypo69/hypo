```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Comments:** The code now includes placeholder comments like `# Replace with your actual constructor parameters.`  Crucially, this points out the need for actual data and method implementations within the `EmilDesign` class, which were missing in the original prompt.  **You MUST provide the actual `EmilDesign` class to generate comprehensive and useful tests.**

2. **Error Handling:** The `test_emil_design_init_invalid_input` example now demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (TypeError, ValueError) and verify that the error message contains the expected text. This is *critical* for robust testing.

3. **Fixture Example:** The `emil_design_instance` fixture demonStartes how to create an instance of the class to use in tests.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately apparent.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover potential scenarios like valid/invalid inputs and the handling of various expected errors, reflecting the requirements for comprehensive testing.  However, without the actual `EmilDesign` class and methods, I've made plausible placeholder tests.


**To run these tests:**

1.  **Replace the placeholders**: Put in the actual `EmilDesign` class and method implementations from your code.

2.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_emil.py`).

3.  **Run from the command line:** `pytest test_emil.py`


This revised solution provides a solid starting point for writing tests for your `EmilDesign` class, including important error handling and comprehensive test coverage. Remember to adapt the tests to match the specifics of your code. Remember to add more tests that actually utilize the methods of the class.
