**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `os.getcwd` and `Path`:** The original code uses `os.getcwd`, which might get different values in different environments or during testing.  Critically, we now mock this method in our tests to control the path returned, allowing for various test cases. Similarly, we now mock `Path` in `test_dir_root_calculation` for more reliable testing of the different returned paths.

2. **`mock_sys_path` and `restore_sys_path`:** We encapsulate the modification and restoration of `sys.path` to ensure a clean test environment for each test case, which is crucial for avoiding unintended side effects between tests.

3. **Clearer Assertions:**  Instead of just relying on `assert True`, the tests now verify specific aspects, making them much more informative. For example, `test_dir_root_calculation` checks the *content* of the calculated `dir_root` rather than just existence.

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**  The example tests now include basic tests for `dir_root`, `sys.path` manipulation, and also demonstrates how to test imports (critical for a project like this).  You need to adapt these to actually test the `gs`, `Supplier`, etc. classes from your project.

5. **Error Handling:** The import tests now include `try...except` blocks to handle `ImportError` exceptions and fail the test with a useful message if a module can't be imported.


**To use these tests:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Update the tests with actual assertions relevant to functions and methods within `src.suppliers` and other modules.
2. **Install pytest:** If you haven't already, install pytest:  `pip install pytest`
3. **Run the tests:** Execute `pytest` in your terminal from the directory containing this test file.

This revised approach provides more robust and informative tests, essential for maintaining a reliable codebase. Remember to add tests for other functions, modules, and classes in the `src` directory as appropriate.  It's important to verify all import statements, calculations, and paths involved in the codebase. Remember to adjust the example tests to your specific application and functionalities.
