**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking PyQt6:**  The crucial addition is mocking `QtWidgets.QMessageBox`.  This is essential because you can't directly interact with the GUI elements in a `pytest` test environment. The mock now prints messages, which you can check in your assertions.
* **Error Handling:** The tests now properly handle `SystemExit` (for the critical message from PyQt6), which is crucial for capturing the error exit from the `add_context_menu_item` function.
* **Temporary File:** Uses `tempfile` to create a temporary file for the `command_path`. This avoids polluting the system's registry with test data. The cleanup happens within the test.
* **Asserting Registry Changes:** You can't directly assert on registry changes in a consistent manner within a test; a proper check for whether the key was created or deleted is needed in your tests.
* **Mock gs.path:**  This directly addresses the undefined `gs.path` variable.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests for both valid input (adding a menu item) and an edge case where the script file isn't found, as well as removal scenarios (item not found, successful removal).
* **Error Checking:**  The tests now assert that the appropriate error messages (or specific error types) are raised or printed when expected.
* **Explicit Cleanup:** The `temp_command_path` fixture is crucial for ensuring the temporary directory is properly deleted after the test, avoiding lingering files.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Create a temporary directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir /temp/gui/context_menu
    ```
3.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_main.py`).


4.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_main.py
    ```

This significantly improved solution is more robust and will better reflect the actual behavior of your code. Remember to adjust imports and paths as needed for your specific project structure. Remember to also install `pytest` if it isn't already installed.
