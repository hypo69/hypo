```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The solution now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `Chrome` objects. This is crucial because the original code interacts with external resources (like a web browser) that can't be reliably tested directly. Mocking allows us to control the behavior of these objects during testing.  Crucially, mocking `logger` is essential for testing the `try...except` block.

2. **Asynchronous Testing (pytest.mark.asyncio):**  The code now includes `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for better handling of asynchronous operations.  This is important for testing `async` methods or operations, especially if they rely on external resources or network requests.

3. **pytest.raises:** The test for exception handling now properly uses `pytest.raises` to capture and test the expected `KeyboardInterrupt`.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.

5. **Comprehensive Tests:** The added tests cover empty inputs and basic exception handling.

6. **Fixture for Mocks:** The `mock_facebook_promoter` fixture now correctly instantiates the `FacebookPromoter` with the mocked `driver`.

**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_start_event.py`) in the same directory as your `start_event.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_start_event.py`

**Further Improvements:**

*   **More Edge Cases:** Test cases need more edge cases for invalid file paths, incorrect event names, and empty file contents.
*   **File Content Validation:** The tests should verify that the files are being read correctly by mocking the file reading operations or using dummy data.
*   **Error Handling:** Test cases need to check how the code handles various potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid JSON).
*   **Realistic Data:** Use more realistic test data that represents the actual data your application will be processing. This often involves creating dummy JSON files containing valid data.
*   **Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary dependencies (e.g., `jjson`, `webdriver`) are installed correctly in your project's `requirements.txt` file.


This improved solution provides a much better framework for testing the `start_event.py` code, helping to ensure its robustness and correctness. Remember to adapt and expand these tests based on the specific behavior and functionality of your application.
