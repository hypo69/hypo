### **ai Module**: AI Model Management

The **ai** module is responsible for managing various AI models, facilitating interactions with external APIs, and handling different configurations for data analysis and language processing. It includes the following submodules:

1. **prompts**  
   System and Command Prompts in markdown Format for AI Models
    - System Prompts:
    System prompts are used to set the context or provide instructions to the AI model before it processes user input. These prompts help guide the model's behavior and ensure it understands the task at hand.
    - Command Instructions:
        Находятся непосредственно в эндпоинтах

2. **anthropic**  
   Provides integration with Anthropic AI models, enabling tasks that rely on advanced language comprehension and response generation.

3. **dialogflow**  
   Integrates with Google Dialogflow, supporting natural language understanding (NLU) and conversational AI functionalities for building interactive applications.

4. **gemini**  
   Manages connections with Gemini AI models, offering support for applications that require Gemini’s unique AI capabilities.

5. **helicone**  
   Connects to Helicone models, providing access to specialized features for customized AI solutions.

6. **llama**  
   Interfaces with LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), designed for tasks involving natural language understanding and generation in a variety of applications.

7. **myai**  
   A custom AI submodule designed for specialized model configurations and implementations, enabling unique, project-specific AI functionalities.

8. **openai**  
   Integrates with OpenAI's API, allowing access to their suite of models (e.g., GPT) for tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.
