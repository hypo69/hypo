How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block, located in `hypotez/src/ai/helicone/helicone.py`, appears to be the initial setup or configuration file for interacting with the Helicone AI platform.  It defines a constant `MODE` likely used to differentiate between development and production environments.  There are several docstrings (triple-quoted strings) that are placeholders and should be filled in with detailed descriptions of the module's operation.  Missing imports and the presence of placeholders suggest that more code needs to be added to make this usable.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a constant `MODE` with the value `'dev'`. This likely sets the operation mode to development.
2. The code contains numerous multiline docstrings (`""" ... """`). These should be populated with comprehensive documentation about the module's purpose, functionality, and usage details.  These strings are essential for providing context and instructions for users of the module.
3. A `header` import statement is present.  The actual functionality of this `header` module is not shown here and is critical for the complete operation.

4. Multiple comments `""" ... """` are placed within the file, which are critical to describing the intended usage and purpose of the module and its classes. This block should contain the specifics about interacting with the Helicone API, authentication procedures, and any other necessary configuration details. 


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a placeholder.  A real usage example requires the missing header import
    # and functions defined elsewhere.
    import header

    # Example of potentially using the defined MODE constant
    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
    else:
        print("Running in production mode.")
