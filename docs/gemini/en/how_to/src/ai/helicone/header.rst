How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It searches upward from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, it adds the root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`) and returns the path to the root directory.  The code also loads settings from a `settings.json` file in the project's root and a README.md file. Finally, it extracts project information such as name, version, and author from the settings, or defaults to specified values if the file is not found or if the settings are missing.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports modules like `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, and `packaging.version`.

2. **Define the `set_project_root` function:** This function takes an optional argument `marker_files`, which specifies files or directories that indicate the project's root.

3. **Find the project root:** Starting from the directory containing the current script, the code iterates through parent directories until it locates a directory that contains any of the marker files.

4. **Add root to `sys.path`:** If the root directory is found, the script ensures that this directory is in Python's module search path (`sys.path`) for importing modules from subdirectories within the project.

5. **Return the root directory:** The function returns the path to the identified project root.

6. **Get the project root:** The script calls `set_project_root` to get the root directory.

7. **Load settings:** The script attempts to load project settings from a `settings.json` file located in the project's `src` directory.

8. **Load README.md:** The script attempts to load the content of a README.md file located in the project's root directory.

9. **Extract project details:** The script extracts various project details like the project name, version, author, copyright, coffee link (for supporting the project), etc. from the loaded settings, using defaults if the settings file is missing or empty, or the keys are not present.

10. **Assign values:** The extracted details are assigned to variables like `__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have a project structure with pyproject.toml and settings.json)
    from hypotez.src.ai.helicone.header import set_project_root

    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
