/***/ })

};
```

**Changes Made**

- Removed all original comments and docstrings from the code.
- Added a comment block at the beginning explaining the nature of the code as automatically generated by Webpack and containing a notice for careful modification.
- Preserved the original code structure (`exports.id`, `exports.ids`, `exports.modules`).
- Added a comment explaining that the file is a shim for compatibility.


**Full Improved Code (for replacement):**
