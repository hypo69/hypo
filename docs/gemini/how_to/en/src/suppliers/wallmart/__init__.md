## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/wallmart/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallmart/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for the Walmart supplier in the `hypotez` project. It primarily imports the `Graber` class from the `graber` submodule.

**How to Use**

The `__init__.py` file is responsible for importing and making available necessary components for interacting with the Walmart supplier. It's usually *not* directly called in your code.  Instead, you'll use the `Graber` class that's exposed by this module.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.wallmart import Graber

# Instantiate the Graber class
graber_instance = Graber()

# ... subsequent code to use the Graber object for Walmart-specific operations ...

# Example:  (Assuming Graber has a 'fetch_products' method)
products = graber_instance.fetch_products(query="Laptop", limit=10)

# ... process 'products' variable
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **`Graber` Class:**  The `Graber` class, imported from `./graber.py`, likely handles the specific tasks of fetching and parsing data from Walmart's APIs.  Consult the `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallmart/graber.py` file for detailed information on how to interact with this class.
* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) is recommended in your code that uses `Graber`, to gracefully manage potential API issues, network problems, or malformed data.
* **Authentication:**  If Walmart's APIs require authentication, the `Graber` class should handle these credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables or configuration files).
* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the `wallmart` supplier (and any dependencies it has) are correctly installed and configured in your project's environment.

**Further Information:**

The comments within the `__init__.py` file provide context about the module's platform compatibility. Refer to the documentation of the `Graber` class for specific functions, parameters, and return values.
