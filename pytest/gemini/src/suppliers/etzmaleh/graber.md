**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` and `logger`.  This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing them from depending on external dependencies.  Mocking `execute_locator` is critical because it handles interactions with the browser.

2. **Error Handling:** A `test_graber_execute_locator_with_exception` test demonStartes how to handle potential errors during the execution. This is vital to ensure the code behaves correctly under various conditions.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test cases now have more descriptive names (e.g., `test_graber_init`).

4. **Fixture for `Graber`:** A `@pytest.fixture` is created to cleanly instantiate `Graber` for each test, reducing setup overhead.

5. **Complete Example:** A complete example `test_graber_init` is provided to show correct usage of assertions and mocks.

6. **Decorator Testing (Placeholder):**  A placeholder `test_close_pop_up_decorator` illuStartes how to test the `@close_pop_up` decorator, which needs specific mocking depending on how it's implemented.  You'll need to adapt this with appropriate mocking for any asynchronous operations or exceptions the decorator might use.  Remember to modify the example if your decorator has particular logic.

7. **Logger Mocking:** The `logger` is mocked to avoid any real logging during the tests.

**How to Run:**

Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`). Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`), and run it from your terminal using `pytest test_graber.py`.


**Important Considerations (for real tests):**

* **Data Driven Tests:**  If `Graber` accepts parameters, use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to create tests for different input values and expected outputs.
* **Specific Functionality:** Include tests for any specific functions within `Graber` that you want to test. Replace the example test with your specific test logic.
* **Exception Handling in Decorator:**  Implement thorough exception handling in your decorator tests to cover cases where `execute_locator` might fail.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** If `Graber` methods use `async` and `await`, your tests must handle them correctly. Consider using `asyncio` for waiting on tasks in your test cases.
* **Dependencies:**  If `Graber` depends on other modules (like `header` or the specific driver), use mocks for those as well.
