.. module: src.suppliers.wallashop
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect field values from the `wallashop.co.il` product page.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    Override these functions in this class for non-standard processing.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class.  To use it, pass a value to `Context.locator`.
    To implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator definition and redefine its behavior.

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Decorator Application:** The `@close_pop_up()` decorator is correctly applied to the `grab_page` function.  Crucially, this means the decorator logic will execute *before* any other function calls within `grab_page`, ensuring consistency and correct behavior.

* **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block is added around the `await self.fetch_all_data(**kwargs)` call.  This is vital for robustness.  If any error occurs within the data fetching, the function now returns `None`, making it clear to the caller that something went wrong.  Critically, `logger.exception` is used, which logs the full exception details for better debugging.

* **`self.driver` Assignment:**  The `self.driver = driver` line is added *inside* the `grab_page` function. This is crucial because in previous versions, the driver wasn't getting correctly assigned *within the scope of the function*.

* **`**kwargs` usage:** The `fetch_all_data` function now correctly takes `**kwargs`. This allows the caller of `grab_page` to pass additional arguments, like the product ID, to control the data extraction logic.

* **Clearer Error Signaling:** Returning `None` from the `grab_page` function when an error occurs is a much better practice than silently failing.

* **Import Fixes:**  Cleaned up any potential import issues you might've had.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Initialize `Context` and `driver`:**  Make sure `Context` and `driver` are properly initialized before calling `grab_page`.

2.  **Call `grab_page` with arguments:** Call the `grab_page` function, passing the necessary arguments like `id_product` in `**kwargs`.

3.  **Check for Errors:** After calling `grab_page`, check if the returned value is `None` to determine if there was an error.


```python
# Example usage (inside a function or loop):
# ... (rest of your code)
# try:
#    result = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='123')
#    if result:
#        # Process the results ...
#        print("Data fetched successfully:", result.to_dict())
#    else:
#        print("Error fetching data.")
# except Exception as e:
#    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


```

This revised solution provides robust error handling, correct function scope, and allows for flexibility in calling the data fetching functions. Remember to replace the `...` placeholders with the actual data extraction logic specific to your needs. Remember to adjust error handling as needed to suit your specific error conditions.
