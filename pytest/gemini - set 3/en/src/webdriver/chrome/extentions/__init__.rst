**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Specific Assertions:** Assertions are more specific to the expected outcome (e.g., `isinstance(__version__, str)`).

3. **Edge Case `test_version_invalid_format`:**  Demonstrates testing for invalid input by using `pytest.raises`.

4. **Handling `__details__`:** The test for `__details__` checks for `None` and verifies that it's a `dict` or `dict-like` object.  Crucially, it uses a `try...except` block, which is *essential* to catch any `AttributeError` if `__details__` doesn't have the expected methods.


5. **Robustness:** The tests are now more robust by checking for the correct type of the output and handling potential errors.

6. **Commented Tests:** Tests are well-commented to explain the logic behind each case.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`__details__` structure:** The test for `__details__` is a placeholder.  You must adapt it based on the actual structure of `__details__`.  If it's a specific data structure (e.g., a namedtuple), you'll need more specific tests.

* **Missing function:** The example `test_function_with_input` is a placeholder.  You should add tests for any other functions from `hypotez.src.webdriver.chrome.extentions` if they exist.


* **Fixtures:** If the functions under test need any setup or data, you'll need to create fixtures for providing this data.  However, in this case, the functions are very simple, and tests are focused on the return values of __version__, __doc__ and __details__.

* **Error Handling:** The tests include `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., invalid version format).



Remember to replace placeholders with the actual functions and data.  Run `pytest` in your terminal to execute these tests.
