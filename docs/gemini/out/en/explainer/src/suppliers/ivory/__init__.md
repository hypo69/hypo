from .graber import Graber

## <algorithm>

This file appears to be an initialization module for the `ivory` supplier within the `hypotez` project.  Its primary function is to import a class from a submodule named `graber`. No significant algorithm or data flow is evident within this `__init__.py` file itself. It essentially just sets up access to the `Graber` class.

**Dependencies Analysis:**

The mermaid diagram shows the primary dependency. `ivory/__init__.py` imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` module (within the `ivory` subdirectory). This imports dependency is shown by the arrow from `ivory/__init__.py` to `graber.py`.

## <explanation>

* **Imports:**
    * `from .graber import Graber`: This line imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` module within the same directory (`./graber`). The `.` indicates a relative import, which is a good practice for internal dependencies.  This import makes the `Graber` class available for use in other modules within the `ivory` package. The absence of other imports suggests that this is a very basic initialization file, focusing on making components from a submodule accessible.

* **Variables:**
    * ``: This variable likely defines the operation mode of the `ivory` supplier, potentially used for configuration or conditional logic in other modules of the project. It's a simple string assignment for configuration, though it's unusual to put this into the `__init__.py` if it's not meant for external use.

* **Classes (implicitly):**
    * `Graber`: This class is defined in `graber.py` and is imported into this `__init__.py` module.  It will likely encapsulate logic related to fetching or processing data from a source identified as "ivory."  Without seeing `graber.py` we cannot detail the attributes and methods of `Graber`.

* **Functions (none directly):**
    * No functions are defined within this file.

* **Potential Errors or Improvements:**
    * **Documentation:**  The docstrings are incomplete. They need more detail, particularly concerning the purpose of the `ivory` supplier and the `Graber` class in context of the broader `hypotez` application.
    * **Mode Variable:**  While the `MODE` variable is simple, it could be a better practice to use a standard configuration system rather than just a simple global variable if this type of functionality is needed.

**Chain of Relationships:**


This file is part of the broader `hypotez` project and has a relationship with any code that imports `Graber` from the `ivory` subpackage.  This would likely include modules in the `hypotez` directory or potentially other suppliers or related components.

**Overall:** The file is concise and clearly imports the necessary `Graber` class.  However, it lacks context beyond simply importing the class, and its functionality depends heavily on the existence of `graber.py`.
