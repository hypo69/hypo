Module: src.db.manager_translations._examples

This module contains version information for the '_examples' submodule within the 'manager_translations' package.

Variables:
    __version__: str
        The version string for the module (e.g., "3.12.0.0.0.4").
    __name__: str
        The name of the module ("__main__" if run directly).
    __doc__: str
        The module's documentation string.
    __details__: str
        Additional details about the version.
    __annotations__:
        Type annotations for variables and functions (likely empty).
    __author__: str
        The author(s) of the module.
"""

__name__ = __name__  # This is almost always redundant, but technically correct.
__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"
__doc__ = __doc__  # Ditto, redundant but correct
__details__ = "Details about version for module or class"
__annotations__ = {}  # Explicitly define as empty
__author__ = 'hypotez '

# Example usage (if you want to demonstrate use):
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Module version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Module name: {__name__}")
    print(f"Module details: {__details__}")
    print(f"Module author: {__author__}")

```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Docstring Enhancements:**  The docstring now clearly explains the purpose of the module and the role of each variable.  Crucially, it explains the likely intended use of `__details__`, which is important for understanding the module's context.

2. **Explicit Empty `__annotations__`:** It's good practice to explicitly initialize `__annotations__` as an empty dictionary, as otherwise it might contain unexpected values.

3. **Example Usage:**  The code now includes an example showing how to access the module's version and other details.  This is a valuable addition for potential users.

4. **Redundant Assignments:**  While technically correct, `__name__ = __name__` and `__doc__ = __doc__` are redundant.  I've left them in the example for clarity but ideally wouldn't be present.

5. **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code now follows standard Python style guidelines (PEP 8) for better readability.


This improved version provides a more informative and usable module, demonstrating good Python coding practices. Remember that the example usage is just a suggestion; you might integrate these details into a larger application. Remember to remove the redundant self-assignments in a production environment.
