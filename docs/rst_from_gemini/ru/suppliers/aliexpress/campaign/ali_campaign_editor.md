**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`campaign_file` parameter:** The constructor now accepts a `campaign_file` argument, allowing the campaign to be loaded from a JSON file if desired.  This is better design than relying on the name for loading.  This addition of this argument is better and more flexible for loading campaigns.

* **CriticalError Handling:** Added `CriticalError` handling to the constructor to enforce that either the campaign name or file path must be provided.  This prevents unexpected behavior.

* **Clearer Comments:** Added more descriptive comments explaining the purpose of different methods and arguments.

* **Error Handling (delete_product):**  The `delete_product` method now includes a crucial `try-except` block to handle cases where the input `product_id` is not an integer, thus preventing a `ValueError`.  This is a critical improvement to make the code robust.

* **Update campaign** method: The `update_campaign` method now effectively updates the campaign data by querying the Google Sheet and saving the updates to the JSON file. This is a very important addition for real-world scenarios where the campaign data is not solely managed by the JSON file.

* **Type Hints:** Added type hints where appropriate, increasing code readability and maintainability.

* **Robustness:** The code now includes robust error handling, making it more resilient to potential issues like missing files or invalid input.

* **`get_category_products` Enhancement (Import):** The `get_category_products` method now ensures the function returns `None` if no JSON files are found, preventing potential errors if a category is empty.

* **`delete_product` improvement:** Handles cases where `product_id` is not an integer, logging an error instead of crashing.


**How to Use (Example):**

```python
from src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_campaign_editor import AliCampaignEditor
from pathlib import Path
from src.utils.exceptions import CriticalError

try:
    campaign_name = "Summer Sale"
    editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name=campaign_name)  # Load from default location (assuming a file exists)
    editor.update_campaign()
    # or for a new campaign load from file
    editor_file = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name="MyCampaign", campaign_file="campaign_data.json")
    editor_file.delete_product(product_id=12345)
    # ... other operations ...
except CriticalError as e:
    print(f"Critical error: {e}")
```


Remember to replace `"campaign_data.json"` with the actual file path if loading from a file.  This greatly enhances the usability of the code by allowing campaigns to be loaded/updated from external sources rather than being tied to a JSON file in the local folder.  Make sure `campaign_data.json` is valid JSON.  You may want to have some error handling around the file existence.
