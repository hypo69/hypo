```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are present in the provided code.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  Returning an empty test file.

# Example of how tests would be written if there were functions:
#
# def test_some_function_with_valid_input():
#     """Tests some_function with valid input."""
#     result = some_function(valid_input)
#     assert result == expected_output
#
# def test_some_function_with_invalid_input():
#     """Tests some_function with invalid input."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         some_function(invalid_input)
#
# def test_some_function_with_edge_case():
#     """Tests some_function with an edge case."""
#     result = some_function(edge_case_input)
#     assert result == expected_edge_case_output
