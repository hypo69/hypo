**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Includes `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` if the script file is missing and more general `Exception` handling for unexpected errors. This makes the API more robust.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  Error messages now include more detailed information about the failure (e.g., the specific error from the script).
* **Input Validation:** Added validation to ensure both `first_name` and `last_name` are provided.
* **`text=True` in `Popen`:**  Crucially, the `text=True` argument is added to `Popen`. This is essential for correctly decoding the output from the subprocess as text. Without this, you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior.
* **Output Handling:** The `stdout` is stripped of whitespace before being returned. This prevents extra spaces or newlines from appearing in the response.
* **Redundant Endpoint Removed:** The `/index.html` endpoint is removed since the HTML is now served correctly by the static file handler.
* **Root Redirect:** The `/` endpoint now returns a message that redirects to the main HTML file (`index.html`) , which is the correct behavior for FastAPI.
* **Browser Opening:** The `webbrowser.open()` call is outside any function and is only called once.  This is important;  repeated attempts will open multiple browsers.
* **Docstrings:**  Added comprehensive docstrings to the `process_data` function and other functions for better code clarity and maintainability.


**How to run:**

1.  **Ensure your `script.py` file exists.**  It should be in the `hypotez/src/` folder.
2.  **Start uvicorn:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

Now, you can open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.  If your form submission works as expected, the output from `script.py` will appear.
