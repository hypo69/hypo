# correctly followed in a hypothetical function that adheres to these rules.

# We will create a mock function called "content_generator" for this example.
# We will assume that this content_generator is intended to generate text and
# we need to test that it respects the provided rules.
# This hypothetical content_generator will be called content_generator_mock.
