```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`client` Fixture:**  The solution now includes a `client` fixture. This is *essential* for testing the interaction with the Flask (or Django) application and mocking responses correctly.  The previous version lacked this vital component.
2. **Mocking the Backend (`monkeypatch`):**  Critically, the tests now use `monkeypatch` to mock the `requests.post` function (assuming a Flask backend).  This is how you simulate responses from the backend without actually running the backend server.  This is *crucial* for isolating the JavaScript portion of the code from the backend logic.
3. **Comprehensive AJAX Tests:** The tests now include `test_ajax_success` and `test_ajax_failure` to check both successful and failed AJAX calls.  It mocks the backend response using `monkeypatch`.

**To use this:**

- Replace `get_generated_html()` with actual logic to retrieve the generated HTML content for testing the HTML structure.
- Add a proper test app fixture (for Flask or Django) to create and manage a test client.
- Replace `/ask` with the actual route where you send user input (if different).
- Ensure you've imported the necessary libraries (e.g., `requests` if you need to mock responses).


**Important:** You *must* have a way to test the actual Flask/Django backend `/ask` route (or equivalent) separately. These JavaScript tests only test the client-side interaction; a proper test suite needs both to be complete. Remember to install the required libraries (e.g., `pytest`, `requests`) if you don't have them already.
