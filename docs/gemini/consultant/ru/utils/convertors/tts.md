**Changes Made**

*   Added detailed docstrings in RST format to functions (`speech_recognizer`, `text2speech`).
*   Replaced `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`, and `j_dumps` usage with proper import.
*   Used more specific exception handling (e.g., `requests.exceptions.RequestException`).
*   Improved error logging, including specific error messages.
*   Added type hints.
*   Fixed potential issues with Path objects and file paths.
*   Updated module docstring to use `.. module::` syntax and proper RST formatting.
*   Modified the function signatures and parameters to align with best practices.
*   Used `response.raise_for_status()` to catch HTTP errors when downloading.
