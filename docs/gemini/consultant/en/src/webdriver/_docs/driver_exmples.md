Driver Examples

```
Changes Made
```
- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Wrapped each example in a `try...except` block to catch and log potential errors using `logger.error()`.
- Improved docstrings using reStructuredText format.
- Added a module-level docstring to describe the file's purpose.
- Removed unnecessary comments.
- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.
- Added TODOs for tasks requiring further development.
- Corrected code style to use single quotes.
