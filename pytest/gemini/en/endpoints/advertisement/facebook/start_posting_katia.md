**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically, the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes are now mocked. This is essential because the original code interacts with external resources (Facebook). Mocking isolates the tests and prevents them from depending on a real Facebook environment or potentially failing due to network issues.  A mock `Driver` is created and injected to `FacebookPromoter`.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_exception_handling`).

3. **Exception Handling:** The `test_facebook_promoter_run_campaigns_exception_handling` test now specifically checks for the correct exception type and message. This is crucial for robust error handling.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing.

5. **Fixture for Promoter:**  A `mock_promoter` fixture is introduced to create the `FacebookPromoter` object.

6. **`caplog` for Logging:**  `caplog` is used to test for messages logged using the logger, making the test more thorough.


7. **Edge Cases:** The tests now include an important edge caseâ€”an empty `campaigns` list.

8. **Missing File Handling:**  A test (`test_facebook_promoter_missing_file`) simulates a missing file, demonstrating handling of `FileNotFoundError`.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_facebook_promoter.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez` code.
3.  Run `pytest test_facebook_promoter.py` in your terminal.


**Important Considerations (Not Covered Directly but Crucial for Real-World Tests):**

* **Robust Mocking:** Mocking `open` is essential for cases where file loading might fail for other reasons (permissions, invalid file format).
* **Error Handling and Logging in Actual Code:** The original code only handles `KeyboardInterrupt`, but real-world applications should have more comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative feedback.
* **External Dependencies:** In a production environment, you might need to use more sophisticated mocking libraries to isolate interactions with Facebook's API more effectively.
* **Input Validation:**  Add tests to validate that the inputs to `run_campaigns` are as expected. For example, if the campaigns list must be strings, make sure the tests confirm this.


This significantly improved solution addresses the issues of the previous versions and provides a much more robust set of tests. Remember to adapt the mocking strategies based on the specific dependencies and error scenarios relevant to your code. Remember to install the `unittest.mock` library if you don't have it already.
