```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Crucially, the code now utilizes `unittest.mock` to mock `Driver`, `SimpleNamespace`, and other parts of the Graber class. This is essential for isolating tests and preventing them from depending on external resources (e.g., a real web driver).  This addresses a critical weakness of the previous example.
2. **Asynchronous Handling:** The `asyncio.run()` is used to properly execute the asynchronous functions within the test cases.
3. **Error Handling:**  The `test_close_popup_decorator_failure` test now demonstrates correct handling of the `ExecuteLocatorException`. It includes assertion to verify that the logger's debug method was called with the correct error message, which is good for debugging unexpected behavior. 
4. **Comprehensive `test_grab_page`:** This test now effectively patches the necessary Graber methods (`id_product`, `description_short`) to simulate their execution without actually interacting with the browser or database.  It asserts the correct calls are made and that the function returns a `ProductFields` object.
5. **Clearer Comments:** Comments are added to better explain the purpose and logic of each test function.
6. **Fixtures:** Fixtures are properly defined and used to make the tests more organized and reusable.

**Important Considerations for Real-World Tests:**

* **Complex Data:**  For the `test_grab_page` test, you'll likely need to mock data that would normally be scraped. The code will return a ProductFields object; you'll need to assert on the *content* of that object (the individual fields) to fully test its functionality.  This may require more intricate mocking for data structures.
* **Realistic Input:** Ensure your tests use realistic (but controlled) input data to effectively check various scenarios and edge cases.
* **Database Interaction:** If your `Graber` class interacts with a database, you'll need to mock database interactions using libraries like `unittest.mock` or a dedicated database mocking framework.

**To Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3. Run `pytest test_graber.py` from your terminal.

Remember to replace placeholder modules (`gs`, `ProductFields`, etc.) with their actual implementations.  The current tests rely on the code given and mock out external functionality. This is a great starting point for building a robust test suite for your `Graber` class.
