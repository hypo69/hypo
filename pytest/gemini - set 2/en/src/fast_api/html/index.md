**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **No Python Code to Test:** The provided code is HTML and JavaScript.  You can't directly test a HTML file with pytest.  The tests above are examples of how to check the *structure* of the HTML and *the structure* of the JavaScript code.  A proper test suite would need to interact with the FastAPI endpoint (`/process_data`).
2. **Mocking is Crucial:**  To effectively test the JavaScript's AJAX calls, you need to mock the `$.ajax` function.  This would allow you to verify that the correct data is sent to the endpoint and handle successful/error responses, as described in the next point.
3. **FastAPI Integration:**  The critical missing piece is the FastAPI endpoint (`/process_data`). You would need to create a simple test FastAPI app to simulate the backend processing.  This would allow you to make assertions about the content of the data received by the endpoint and the responses returned.  This way, you can comprehensively verify the interaction between the front-end and the back-end.
4. **Error Handling:**  The test for the JavaScript's AJAX call should include checking the `error` callback function. This is essential for ensuring robust error handling.
5. **Clearer Comments and Structure:** The tests now include comments explaining the purpose of each test function.

**How to Extend and Make it Functional:**

```python
# Example (IlluStartive only - needs to be adapted to your FastAPI setup):

import pytest
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient


app = FastAPI()

# ... Your FastAPI endpoint to process data
@app.post("/process_data")
async def process_data(data: dict):
    if not data.get('first_name') or not data.get('last_name'):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Missing data")
    return {"message": f"Hello {data['first_name']} {data['last_name']}"}


client = TestClient(app)

# ... Rest of your tests (following the structure from the previous answer).



def test_successful_data_submission(client):
    response = client.post(
        "/process_data",
        json={"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello John Doe"}



def test_missing_data(client):
    response = client.post(
        "/process_data",
        json={"first_name": "John"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Missing data"}


```

Replace the placeholder comments with your actual FastAPI code, including error handling and any necessary input validation. These updated tests now correctly integrate with the FastAPI backend and perform assertions to confirm the endpoint's behavior. Remember to adapt the assertions to accurately reflect the expected responses.
