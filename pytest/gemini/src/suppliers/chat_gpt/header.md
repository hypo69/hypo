**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Uses `mock_open` to mock file operations.  This is crucial for testing the file handling within `set_project_root` without relying on actual files.  This is much more robust, as it prevents accidental file creation or modification in test directories.  Crucially, it correctly simulates file not found.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

* **Edge Cases:** Tests for cases where marker files aren't found (e.g., `test_set_project_root_marker_not_found`). Also correctly tests scenarios when the current directory is the root, eliminating a potential bug.

* **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` within the file handling parts.  The `parametrize` approach makes the exception-handling tests more concise.

* **Fixture for Mock Data:** A `mock_settings_json` fixture is used to provide mock JSON data. This is cleaner than directly embedding the JSON in the test functions.

* **pytest-mock (unnecessary):** Since you are directly mocking the `open` function it is not necessary to use pytest-mock.

* **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Leverages `pytest.tmpdir` to create temporary directories. This is essential for isolating tests and avoiding interference between them.

* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover valid inputs, missing marker files, multiple markers, and now more importantly, various exception handling cases.


This revised solution is significantly more robust and comprehensive in its testing of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
