**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **No `example_data` Fixture:** The provided code example likely had a fixture for example data. Without `emil_design.py` being included, that fixture cannot be constructed.
2. **Import Statement:** The corrected code now properly imports the module.
3. **`MODE` Variable Test:**  This test verifies the critical `MODE` variable's value.
4. **EmilDesign Class Test:** A test is included for instantiating the `EmilDesign` class.  This assumes the class exists. If it doesn't, remove this test. Replace placeholders with actual attributes and methods.
5. **Exception Handling:** The `test_function_with_invalid_input` demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions, a critical part of robust testing.  The example uses a `ValueError`. Change this to the exception that your function in `emil_design.py` is expected to raise.
6. **Placeholder Test Cases:** The commented-out test functions are placeholders. **You must replace them** with actual tests based on the functions defined in `emil_design.py`.
7. **Missing Code:** The key is to **replace the placeholder tests** in the `test_function_with_*` methods with tests that check the correctness of functions in `emil_design.py`.  Crucially, if there are no functions, remove the commented-out placeholder tests completely.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (above) as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_emil.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_emil.py`


**Crucial Next Steps:**

Provide the contents of `hypotez/src/endpoints/emil/emil_design.py`.  This is absolutely necessary to write accurate and comprehensive test cases. Without the definition of the `EmilDesign` class, and any functions defined in that file, these are just example tests.  You must replace the placeholders with tests based on what's actually in the code you're testing.
