**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_content`).
* **Specific Assertions:** Instead of just asserting `True`, the tests now verify the *content* of the variables, checking their types and expected values.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:**  Added a `test_module_import_with_missing_file` example to show how to use `pytest.raises` to check for `ModuleNotFoundError`.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **Import Handling:** The `test_module_imports` function now checks if the module can be imported, demonStarting how to handle import errors, which is essential to detect issues in the file system or project setup. This is critical in a real-world scenario where many other files may depend on this one existing.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover the most important aspects of the module: ensuring that the version string is a string and has the expected value, and verifying that other attributes (`__author__`, `__details__`) are strings.
* **Robustness:** The added error handling (using `pytest.raises`) makes the tests more reliable in different situations, which can include files that do not exist or other runtime problems.
* **File Existence Check (Important):**  The solution now includes a `test_module_import_with_missing_file` example that demonStartes using `pytest.raises(ModuleNotFoundError)` to check if the file exists and can be imported.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save the test code:** Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as the Python module (`hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/locators/version.py`).
2.  **Run the tests:** Open a terminal in that directory and run `pytest test_version.py`.


This improved solution provides a more comprehensive and reliable way to test the `version.py` module, making it more useful in a real-world testing workflow. Remember to adjust the imports according to the actual directory structure of your project. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/...` with the correct path to your module. Also, make sure the `hypotez` package is correctly set up in your `sys.path` if it's not in the current directory.
