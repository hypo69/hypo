```

**Usage Guide:**

This Python file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for a supplier related to the `morlevi` system.

**Key elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This likely defines the operational mode of the system.  `'dev'` suggests development mode.  In a production environment, this would likely be set to `'prod'` or a similar value.  This variable will likely be used to control how the `morlevi` code behaves, for example, by changing default settings, logging levels, or access to different data sources.

* **`from .graber import Graber`:** This imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` module located within the same directory (`./graber.py`).  `graber.py` likely contains the core logic for interacting with the `morlevi` supplier.  The `Graber` class is a crucial part of the `morlevi` supplier.

**How to use:**

1. **Import the Graber class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.morlevi import Graber
```

2. **Instantiate a Graber object:**

```python
graber_instance = Graber()
```

This will create an instance of the `Graber` class, initializing any necessary resources or configurations based on the code within `graber.py`.  The methods and attributes provided by the `Graber` class are crucial for performing actions related to the `morlevi` supplier.

**Example Usage (assuming `graber.py` has a `get_data()` method):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.morlevi import Graber

graber = Graber()
data = graber.get_data() # Replace 'get_data' with the appropriate method

print(data)
```

**Next Steps:**

To understand how to use the `morlevi` supplier effectively, you need to examine the `hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/graber.py` file.  This file likely contains the implementation of the `Graber` class and the specific logic for interacting with the `morlevi` supplier.  Review the documentation or comments in that file to learn about the available methods, parameters, and expected data types. This will fully detail how to interact with the `morlevi` supplier and its associated tools.
