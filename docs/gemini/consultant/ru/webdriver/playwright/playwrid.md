This code defines a subclass of `PlaywrightCrawler` called `Playwrid`. 
It provides additional functionality such as the ability to set custom browser settings, profiles, and launch options using Playwright.

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    browser = Playwrid()
    browser.start("https://www.example.com")

**Changes Made**

- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Changed the module docstring to use RST format and improved clarity.
- Changed class docstring to RST format.
- Changed function docstrings to RST format.
- Removed unnecessary comments and adjusted docstring parameters to follow RST conventions.
