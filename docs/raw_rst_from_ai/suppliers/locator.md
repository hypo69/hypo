**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Improved error handling. The `FileNotFoundError` now includes the file path in the message for easier debugging, and the `ValueError` now contains the original exception message from `j_loads_ns`.
* **Type Hinting and Validation:** Added type hinting for `gs.path.src`  (assumes it's a `Path` object) and included a `TypeError` if `gs.path.src` is not a `Path`. This is crucial for robust code.  This prevents cryptic errors later on.
* **Explicit File Existence Check:** Added a check `if not self.locators_path.exists():`  before attempting to load the file.  This prevents a possible `FileNotFoundError` from `j_loads_ns` which is more explicit.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Added a `locators_path` attribute for better clarity.  This makes the file path easier to reference and understand, which is good for readability.
* **Using `Path`:**  The code now properly uses `pathlib.Path`. This is essential for cross-platform compatibility and better handling of file paths.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# Example usage (assuming gs.path.src is correctly initialized as a pathlib.Path object)
# ... import necessary modules ...

try:
    locator_instance = Locator("some_supplier_prefix")
    # Access locator data:
    print(locator_instance.locator.attribute1)  # Accessing an attribute from the loaded JSON
except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading locator: {e}")
```

**Crucial Considerations for `gs` and `Path`:**

This improved code assumes that `gs` and `__init__.py` properly initialize and provide a `pathlib.Path` object for `gs.path.src`.  If `gs.path.src` is not a `Path` object, the `TypeError` is raised.  Make sure `gs` and `__init__.py` are functioning as expected to use this correctly. This is vital to maintain robust error handling.  Proper initialization in `__init__.py` or your application's setup is critical for avoiding runtime errors and to use `pathlib.Path` properly.
