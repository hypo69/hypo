**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **TypeError Handling:** Added tests for `None`, empty strings, and integer inputs to check for type errors that might arise if the `login` function doesn't gracefully handle different input types.
* **Example Exception Handling:** DemonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for custom exceptions (like `ConnectionError`).  **Crucially**, this test is marked with `@pytest.mark.skipif` because the previous test was incomplete and didn't demonStarte interaction with a supplier class.  **Remove this skip** when you have the real supplier object.
* **Placeholder for actual supplier objects:** The code now includes placeholder examples of how to handle different input types.  The comments explain the structure assumes that you have a `Supplier` class and that you can create instances of that class.
* **Clarity and Specificity:** Test names are more explicit (e.g., `test_login_invalid_input_type`).
* **Important Note:** The most critical part of this test suite is the inclusion of tests involving actual supplier objects.  The provided `supplier_data` fixture is a template.  Replace `"testSupplier"` and `"supplier_class"` with your actual data and object structures.  This is the key to testing the real logic of your `login` function in the context of your system.  Without interacting with a realistic supplier object, the tests are incomplete.

**How to use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Change all the placeholders (e.g., `testSupplier`, `ConnectionError`, `supplier_class`) with the correct names from your actual code.
2. **Implement `Supplier` Class:** Create a `Supplier` class (or modify an existing one) that you can instantiate for testing.
3. **Run the Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the test file.


This improved example provides a more realistic and comprehensive testing approach for your `login` function. Remember to adapt it further to the specific functionality and requirements of your supplier object. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
