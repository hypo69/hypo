FURS FUR TRADING EXPEDITION 
Description 
You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 
leaving the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the 
next year. You have a choice of three forts at which you may 
trade. The cost of supplies and the amount you receive for your 
furs will depend upon the fort you choose. You also specify 
what types of furs that you have to trade. 
The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer.
