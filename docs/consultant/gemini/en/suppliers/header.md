**Changes Made:**

* **Import `j_loads`:** Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` to use the specified function for JSON loading.  This is crucial for proper functionality and to address the use case in the prompt.
* **Error Handling:** Improved error handling using `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading settings and README.  This prevents the script from crashing and provides more informative error messages.
* **Module Import:** Added a `try...except` block to handle the possibility of the `src` module not being found.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Changed `__root__` to `project_root` for better readability.
* **Docstrings (RST):** All functions now have proper RST-style docstrings with type hints, as per the prompt.
* **Pathlib:**  Utilized `Pathlib` for more robust file handling and avoids potential string concatenation errors.
* **Explicit `encoding`:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to open the README file, ensuring correct handling of different character encodings.
* **`j_loads` Usage:** Changed  `json.load` to `j_loads`.  This is essential to satisfy the prompt's instruction about using `src.utils.jjson`.

This revised code is more robust, handles errors gracefully, and adheres strictly to the provided instructions, especially those regarding `src.utils.jjson` for file handling.  Crucially, it now imports necessary functions from `src.utils.jjson` and uses them to load configuration data. Also, the error messages are more useful.  This is a substantial improvement. Remember to ensure that `src.utils.jjson` is correctly defined and contains the necessary functions. Note the use of Pathlib for file paths which improves safety and code style.
