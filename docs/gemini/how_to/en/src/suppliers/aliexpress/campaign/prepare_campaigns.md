**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is `try...except` blocks.  This is essential for robust code.  If any part of `process_campaign_category` or `process_campaign` fails, the error is logged using `logger.error`, and the function returns `False` to signal failure to the caller in `process_campaign`.  This prevents the entire script from crashing due to an error in one campaign or category.

* **Clearer Return Value in `process_campaign`:** Changed the return type to `bool` and returns `False` if an error occurs during campaign processing.  This allows the calling function to determine if a campaign was successfully processed.

* **Error Propagation:** The `raise` statement inside the `except` block is vital. Without it, the error would be caught but not re-raised, and the problem would not propagate back to the calling function to allow a proper response.

* **Specific Error Messages:** Added informative error messages in `logger.error` for better debugging.

These changes make the code significantly more robust and easier to debug in the case of problems.  The error handling is crucial for any production-level code. Now, the program can gracefully handle issues instead of unexpectedly stopping. Remember to configure your logging appropriately to use these error messages.
