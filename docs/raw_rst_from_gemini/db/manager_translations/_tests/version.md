This module contains version information for the tests related to the translation manager database.

- `__version__`: The version string for the test module.
- `__name__`: The name of the module.  If run as a script, this will be "__main__".
- `__doc__`: The module's docstring, which provides an overview of the module's purpose.
- `__details__`: A string containing more detailed information about the version or the module's purpose.
- `__annotations__`: A variable containing type annotations (if any).  These are used for static analysis and type hinting.
- `__author__`: The author(s) of the module.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **`__name__`:**  The code now explicitly sets `__name__ = "__main__"`. This is crucial.  If the file is run directly, it'll have `__name__ = "__main__"`, allowing the code within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to execute. Otherwise, this block is skipped when imported.


* **`__doc__`:** The `__doc__` string is more descriptive, explaining the module's purpose.


* **`__details__`:**  The string is improved to better reflect the module's context and function.


* **`__annotations__`:**  The code now initializes `__annotations__` to an empty dictionary if it's not already defined.


* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** A crucial addition.  This block ensures that the print statements only run when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.  This prevents unintended output if the file is used as part of a larger project.

* **Output:** Includes clear print statements to demonstrate the values of the variables, improving readability when running the script.


**How to use:**

Save this code as `version.py` in the specified directory.  To run it, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory, and execute:

```bash
python version.py
```

This will print the version, name, details, and author to the console.

This improved version is much more robust and functional, as it now acts as a proper Python module. Remember to use a `venv` (virtual environment) for your project to isolate dependencies.  Using the correct `venv` path in `` is important.
