**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder for Actual Code:** The provided `input_code` was empty.  The example code now includes a function `add_numbers`.  Crucially, replace the example with your actual code.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios:
   - Valid inputs (positive, negative, zero, floats)
   - Invalid inputs (non-numeric types) using `pytest.raises` for exception handling.
   - Edge cases (large numbers)

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive, indicating the input and expected outcome.

4. **Independent Tests:** Each test function is isolated, focusing on a single aspect of the function's behavior.

5. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type` test demonstrates how to assert that the function raises the expected exception using `pytest.raises`.

6. **Comments:** The tests are accompanied by comments explaining the purpose of each test case.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace the example code:**  Substitute your actual Python code into the `...` placeholder in the original prompt.

2. **Run the tests:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_comments_improver.py`).  Then, run `pytest test_comments_improver.py` from your terminal. pytest will automatically discover and execute the test functions.

This improved example provides a solid foundation for writing test cases. Adapt it further to fit the specific requirements and complexity of your actual code. Remember to focus on testing different input types, edge cases, and exceptional situations for thorough coverage. Remember to adjust the tests based on any new features or functionality introduced in your code.  Adding more tests for different types of numbers, including large and small values, is always a good idea.  The `test_add_numbers_large_input` is a good start in that direction.
