```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_is_valid_version_string`).

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  While the original example functions likely did not throw exceptions directly, this example now uses `pytest.raises` for illuStartive purposes. This will be useful if your actual code *does* raise exceptions that you want to test for. (The example now includes appropriate `pytest.raises` for the `Version` class).  

3. **Data-Driven Tests (`pytest.mark.parametrize`):** The test `test_details_contains_expected_keys` now uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to create multiple tests for each expected key (name, version, description), making the tests more efficient.

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  The tests now explicitly check for expected errors using `pytest.fail` and `assert` statements to ensure the tests are robust.  This is extremely important for edge cases that the original code might not handle.  The example shows a basic `pytest.raises` test and comments on more possibilities, including a missing key.

5. **Import Correction:** The test code correctly imports `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from the `version.py` file.  This crucial part of a functional test.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2. **Run pytest:** Execute the command `pytest test_version.py` in your terminal.

**Crucial Next Steps (based on the original code):**

- **Add Functionality:** You need to provide the actual Python code that the tests are supposed to test. This test framework would need to test the logic within the functions that you have not provided in the example.
- **Identify Potential Errors:** Carefully review the expected behavior of the code. Determine what inputs could lead to problems, what edge cases exist, and what exceptions might be raised.
- **Detailed Edge Cases:**  The example tests are placeholders. You likely need *more* specific tests for different types of invalid versions. 


By providing the actual Python code from `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/version.py`, we can generate more specific and comprehensive test cases.
