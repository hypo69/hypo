Module: src.endpoints.bots.discord

This module provides initialization and access to Discord bot functionality.
It imports necessary components, such as the TelegramBot class, and the version information.
"""


from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__

from .telegram_bot import TelegramBot


# Add any other necessary imports or definitions for the Discord bot here.  
# For example, if there are specific Discord client initialization routines
# or other components that belong to the Discord bot logic.
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring now clearly describes the module's purpose, adding context.  Crucially, it explains *why* you would use this module, and what you can expect to find there.
* **Missing context clarification:** The original docstring mentioned a "telegram_bot" but the file seemingly contains Discord bot logic.   This has been clarified in the updated docstring, making it more accurate.
* **Informative docstring:** The docstring now describes the module's content and purpose. This is vital for documentation and understanding the code's role in the project.
* **Placeholder for Discord-specific code:**  The comment `# Add any other necessary imports or definitions for the Discord bot here` is important. It acknowledges that there might be more Discord-specific logic to initialize the Discord bot within this file, beyond just importing the `TelegramBot` (which seems incongruent with the module name).


**Important Considerations:**

* **File Content Discrepancy:** The code in the prompt imports `TelegramBot` from a `.telegram_bot` file. However, the module name (`.discord`) suggests Discord bot logic. This is a potential discrepancy, which should be resolved either by:
    * **Renaming the file**: Rename `.telegram_bot` to `.discord_bot` or a more appropriate Discord-specific name.
    * **Revising imports**: Remove `from .telegram_bot import TelegramBot` if this import is actually wrong and add correct imports for Discord-related components if they exist.
* **Missing Discord Bot Logic:** The code in the prompt imports the version information but doesn't contain any actual Discord bot initialization logic.  It's essential that you fill this in with imports and code necessary for connecting to a Discord bot, handling events, and processing commands.  The `TelegramBot` import is a red flag that the current code needs extensive revision.
* **Version Information:**  The inclusion of versioning is good practice; however, the `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__` variables should be properly defined within the `.version` module.  This example assumes they are already present and correctly populated.


By incorporating these improvements, the module documentation becomes significantly more valuable and accurately reflects the expected functionality of the file. Remember to adjust the code based on the actual content and purpose of your Discord bot module.
