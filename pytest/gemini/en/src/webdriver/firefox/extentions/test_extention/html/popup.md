import pytest

# No Python code is present in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no test cases can be written.  The tests would depend on the
# JavaScript and interactions with the webpage, which are not included.

# Example structure (placeholder) assuming a hypothetical Python file
# interacting with the HTML:

# def test_load_page_success(driver):
#     """Checks if the page loads successfully."""
#     driver.get("file:///path/to/popup.html")  # Replace with correct path
#     assert "Hypotez" in driver.title, "Page title not found"
#     assert "Привет, Это Давидка. Я обучаю модель" in driver.page_source, "Expected text not found"
    
# def test_load_page_failure(driver, bad_url):
#     """Tests failure to load a non-existent page."""
#     with pytest.raises(Exception) as excinfo:
#         driver.get(bad_url)
#     assert "Could not load page" in str(excinfo.value), "Expected error message not found"

# def test_click_button(driver):
#     """Tests clicking a button (if applicable)."""
#     # Find the button element by ID or other selector
#     button = driver.find_element("id", "myButton")
#     button.click()
#     # Assert some change on the page after clicking the button
#     assert "Button clicked" in driver.page_source, "Page did not update after clicking"


# Example fixture (for a hypothetical webdriver):
# @pytest.fixture
# def driver():
#     # Replace with your webdriver initialization.  This is crucial!
#     from selenium import webdriver
#     driver = webdriver.Firefox()
#     yield driver
#     driver.quit()

# Example placeholder for a bad URL fixture:
# @pytest.fixture
# def bad_url():
#     return "invalid_url"  # Replace with a truly bad URL
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **No Python Code:** The provided HTML file does not contain any Python code to test.  This example shows placeholder test cases that *would* be relevant if a Python file (likely using Selenium or a similar library) existed to interact with the HTML page.

2. **Selenium Integration:**  To test an HTML page, you'll need a web driver (like Selenium's Firefox driver, or other compatible ones) in your test environment to control and interact with the browser.  You'll need to install the Selenium library:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. **File Paths:**  You need to replace `"file:///path/to/popup.html"` with the *actual* path to your `popup.html` file.

4. **Page Elements:** Replace placeholders like `"id", "myButton"` with the correct selectors (e.g., IDs, CSS selectors, XPath) for the elements you want to interact with on the page.

5. **Error Handling:** The `pytest.raises` example demonstrates how to test for expected exceptions. This is crucial for robustness.

6. **Driver Fixture:** The example uses a `driver` fixture to manage the WebDriver.  This is crucial to properly initialize and close the browser after each test run.

7. **`yield` in the fixture:** The `yield` keyword in the driver fixture is essential.  It lets pytest manage the fixture properly, ensuring that the browser is closed after each test.

8. **Test Structure:** The example structure demonstrates the required test function names. Add more specific tests based on what operations the HTML page (or Python code that interacts with it) performs.

**How to Run:**

Save the above example code (with the necessary modifications) as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_popup.py`).  Ensure your Selenium driver is correctly installed and ready. You can then run the tests using:

```bash
pytest test_popup.py
```

This will execute the test cases and provide results about their success or failure. Remember to replace placeholders with the actual code and paths for the file. Remember to install Selenium.  For Firefox, you will need the appropriate WebDriver for your Firefox version.
