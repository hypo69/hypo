**Changes Made**

- Added `import logging` and `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` to enable error logging and JSON handling.
- Added a `prepare_all_campaigns` function to encapsulate the campaign preparation logic.
- Included a comprehensive docstring for the `prepare_all_campaigns` function in RST format.
- Added exception handling using `try...except` block to catch and log errors using `logger.error`.
- Replaced the old comments with RST format style comments.
- Removed unnecessary `#!` shebang lines (these lines are not necessary in Python).
- Added `__name__` check for possible example usage.
- Improved variable names for better readability.
- Docstrings for functions, modules, and classes were added to comply with the requested format.
