**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses mocking (`monkeypatch` and `MockPath`) to simulate different scenarios, especially for file existence checks. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding relying on external files.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and follow the specified style guide.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_root_not_found` test explicitly checks for the expected exception (and its appropriate type) when the root directory is not found, enhancing the test coverage.

4. **Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_root_not_found` test directly addresses an edge case where no matching file is found, showcasing appropriate error handling.

5. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Testing:** The `test_set_project_root_root_not_found` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` effectively for exceptions.


6. **Fixture for `Path` object:** The `mock_path_object` fixture provides a consistent `Path` object to work with, reducing code repetition and improving maintainability.

7. **Multiple File Existence:**  The `test_set_project_root_multiple_marker_files` test now directly asserts that multiple files exist. This is a more realistic test than checking for just one file.

8. **Handling `sys.path`:** The `test_set_project_root_already_in_path` test checks the scenario when the root directory is already in `sys.path`, ensuring the function behaves correctly.

**How to Run:**

Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `header.py`. Then run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.  This assumes you have `pytest` installed.  If not, run `pip install pytest` first.

Remember to replace placeholders like `__file__` with actual file paths if needed for more accurate testing in your specific project.  The mocking greatly reduces the need for complex setup and cleanup, focusing on the logic of the function itself.
