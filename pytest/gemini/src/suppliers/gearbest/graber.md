# These tests are placeholders and require further refinement based on the actual functionality
# of the `close_pop_up` decorator.

# The previous tests were problematic because the close_pop_up decorator was not implemented
# in the code snippet. The below example assumes a simpler implementation of the class and
# tests that the __init__ method does not cause any unexpected errors.

#Example test case assuming __init__ sets Context values directly.  Replace if needed.

    """Tests if Graber __init__ correctly sets Context attributes."""
    graber = Graber(driver)
    assert Context.locator_for_decorator is None  #Verify the expected context attribute
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` and `Mock` to mock the `Driver` object and its `execute_locator` method. This is crucial for testing methods that interact with external resources (like web drivers). This way, we avoid external dependencies and keep tests isolated.  Mocking `logger.debug` is included for better control and testing if exceptions are logged correctly.

2. **Fixtures:** `pytest.fixture` is used for `driver` and `graber` to create instances of the classes, which is more organized and efficient than creating them in each test function.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are clear and descriptive, reflecting the specific aspect of the class being tested.

4. **Edge Case Handling:** The tests now address the `__init__` method, which is a crucial part of object creation.

5. **Robustness:** The tests include proper error handling using `pytest.raises` (this part is commented out due to the lack of an exception in the original code).


**Important Considerations for Complete Testing:**

* **Missing `close_pop_up`:**  The provided code has a placeholder for `close_pop_up` but doesn't contain actual implementation.  To thoroughly test it, you'll need to complete the `close_pop_up` function and the decorator it uses.  The provided test outlines (now commented out) should guide you in writing tests for it.

* **Context Usage:** The test cases for `Graber` `__init__` are now very basic. You need to adapt them to test how the initialization affects the global `Context` object's internal state if applicable.  Adapt the testing around `Context.locator_for_decorator` according to the actual behavior in `Graber`'s `__init__`.

* **Specific Tests:** The comments have been added to point out sections that need more specific tests.

By filling in the commented-out sections and adding tests for the actual functionality of the `close_pop_up` decorator, you will have a much more comprehensive test suite for `Graber`. Remember to replace the mocks with actual implementations when testing with a real web driver. Remember to adapt test methods and assertions based on the actual implementation of the class and how the Context object is used.
