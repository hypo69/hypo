```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` test now correctly checks for the expected exception (`Exception`) when no marker files are found in any ancestor directory.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test case.

3. **Realistic Test Data:** The tests now create temporary directories and files to simulate a project structure, ensuring the tests are more robust.

4. **Temporary Directory Cleanup:** Crucial addition of `shutil.rmtree` to delete the temporary directories after each test.  This prevents accidental leftover files and ensures tests are independent.

5. **Multiple Parent Handling:** Added a test `test_set_project_root_marker_files_in_multiple_parent` to ensure the function correctly selects the *closest* ancestor directory containing the marker files.

6. **`pytest.raises` for Errors:** `pytest.raises` is used in `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`  to test the exception handling when no marker files are found.

7. **Current File Handling:** The `test_set_project_root` functions  now use the `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` for `current_file` so the tests are not dependent on the test module being in the same location. The code uses relative path when creating test files to reduce dependency from the specific test file's location.



This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous response and provides a more comprehensive and robust set of test cases for the `set_project_root` function, including error handling and realistic test data. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pytest` and `packaging`. You'll also need to run `pip install .` or similar command in your test environment to allow the import of the code from the `hypotez` package.


```bash
pip install pytest
pip install packaging
```
