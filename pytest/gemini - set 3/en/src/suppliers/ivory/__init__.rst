# Important: This test requires a suitable Graber implementation in the file
# to actually be useful.
# The above tests are testing file handling/input, not Graber's core functionality.
# If there are methods or attributes within Graber (e.g. processing the content) 
# you will need to modify these tests accordingly to test that logic.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for File Handling:** The `sample_file` fixture now creates a temporary file for each test, making tests independent and cleaning up afterwards.  This is crucial for avoiding file system conflicts.

2. **Specific Error Handling:** Instead of a generic `Exception`, it now uses `pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError)` and `pytest.raises(TypeError)` for more focused exception handling. This clarifies the expected exception type.

3. **Edge Cases:** Includes tests for empty files and files with different encodings (important for real-world data).

4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly indicate the scenario (e.g., `test_graber_nonexistent_file`).

5. **File cleanup:**  The `sample_file` fixture now removes the temporary file after each test execution. This prevents leftover files from interfering with other tests or the file system.

6. **Example use and missing functionality handling:** The last comments note the need for testing the `Graber` class's actual core logic (if present). The provided tests now focus on the file-handling aspect of `Graber`.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_ivory.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_ivory.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.


**Crucial Next Step:**

You need to provide the implementation of the `Graber` class in `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/__init__.py`. These tests currently just check the file access part; they need to be extended to test any methods or attributes of the `Graber` class, given that actual code is present. The above code provides a solid framework for the testing; you need to flesh out the tests based on the details in the class.  Without the `Graber` class's code, testing its specific behavior is impossible. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific methods and logic of the `Graber` class.
