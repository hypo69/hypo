**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixture for `settings_data`:** This fixture now creates a temporary `settings.json` file with example data.  This is crucial for testing without modifying the original file.  It's also more reusable.
* **`settings_file_path` fixture:**  Provides direct access to the path of the temporary settings file, which is essential for cleanup.
* **`mocked_settings` fixture (new):** This fixture loads the data from the settings file directly. This is a best practice for mocking and makes testing clearer.
* **Test for missing file:** Added a test case (`test_settings_not_found`) to verify the handling of a missing or empty `settings.json` file.
* **Test for Invalid JSON:** Added a test (`test_settings_invalid_json`) to handle the case where `settings.json` is not valid JSON.
* **Cleanup Function (`teardown_module`):** Added a `teardown_module` function to remove the temporary `settings.json` file after the tests are complete. This prevents leftover files from accumulating and ensures your tests run clean.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and precise.
* **pytest.raises:**  The `pytest.raises` is **not** required for checking missing or invalid JSON files, as `settings` will be None in those cases.  Exception-testing is only needed for specific exceptions raised during loading.
* **Import Statements:** Added explicit imports for `json`, `os`, and `pathlib`.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_version.py`

This revised solution addresses the potential issues with file handling, provides a cleaner way to manage test data, and creates a robust set of tests for the `version.py` code. Remember to replace `"settings.json"` with the correct path to your settings file if you are using a different file name or location.  Also, if `__root__` is a specific attribute/variable in your code, adjust the fixture as needed to accommodate this.
