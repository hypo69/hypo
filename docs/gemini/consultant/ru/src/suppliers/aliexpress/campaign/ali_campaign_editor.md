# Changes Made

*   Added missing docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes in RST format.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Added `logger.error` for error handling instead of redundant `try-except` blocks.  Used `exc_info=True` in `logger.error` calls for better debugging.
*   Improved variable naming and structure for better readability.
*   Corrected the save_text_file call in the delete_product function to properly handle the list and the newline character.
*   Added more descriptive and informative comments throughout the code.
*   Corrected some formatting inconsistencies.
