```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.ai.myai.traffic_light as traffic_light

# No meaningful data is present in the provided code.  
#  The tests below will be extremely basic and focus on potential
#  errors related to the file structure, or missing functions.
#  To create robust tests, please provide the actual functionality of
#  traffic_light.py.



def test_module_exists():
    """Checks if the module exists."""
    assert hasattr(traffic_light, "__file__")



def test_mode_is_set():
    """Checks if the MODE constant is defined."""
    assert hasattr(traffic_light, "MODE")
    assert isinstance(traffic_light.MODE, str)
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided Python code (`traffic_light.py`) is entirely empty except for comments.  Without any actual functions or classes, meaningful tests cannot be written.  To create effective tests, you must provide the actual code implementing the traffic light logic.

**How to Improve the Tests:**

1. **Provide the `traffic_light.py` code:**  The tests above are extremely basic placeholders. To generate useful tests, you need to furnish the Python code that `traffic_light.py` defines.

2. **Identify functions and classes:** Once the code is available, pinpoint the functions, methods, and classes you want to test.

3. **Define test cases for each element:** For each function/method, consider:
   - **Valid inputs:** Test the code with normal data.
   - **Invalid inputs:** What happens with incorrect data types, out-of-range values, or unexpected input formats?  Use `pytest.raises` to verify the expected exceptions are raised.
   - **Edge cases:** Are there boundary conditions or limits to input values? Consider minimum, maximum, and intermediate values.
   - **Exceptional situations:** If the code handles specific exceptions, test those cases.

4. **Example (Illustrative, requires actual code):**

```python
# Example assuming traffic_light.py has a function like this:
# def calculate_wait_time(current_state, previous_state):


def test_calculate_wait_time_valid_input():
    # Replace with actual valid states and expected time
    assert traffic_light.calculate_wait_time("green", "red") == 5

def test_calculate_wait_time_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        traffic_light.calculate_wait_time("invalid", "red")
    assert "Invalid state" in str(excinfo.value)

def test_calculate_wait_time_edge_case():
    # Replace with appropriate edge case.
    assert traffic_light.calculate_wait_time("red", "red") == 1 # or something

```

**Important Points for Testing:**

- **Clear naming conventions:** Use descriptive names for your test functions (e.g., `test_calculate_wait_time_valid_input`).
- **Isolation:** Each test should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
- **Structure:** Organize your tests logically, grouping related tests together.
- **Thoroughness:**  Test a variety of scenarios, including both normal and unusual cases.
- **Error Handling:** Test how the code handles errors and unexpected inputs (using `pytest.raises`).


By providing the actual `traffic_light.py` code, I can furnish considerably more comprehensive and useful test cases.
