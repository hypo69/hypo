```

**Changes Made:**

- Added type hints (`typing.Tuple`, `Path`) for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Improved error handling with `try-except` blocks and informative error messages.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from the `src.utils.jjson` module (assuming it exists).
- Corrected the handling of the `settings` variable, making it more robust.
- Added a docstring to the `get_project_root` function, specifying the parameter types and return type, as well as raising the `FileNotFoundError` for cases where no marker file is found.
- Improved variable naming conventions (e.g., `project_root`).
- Added proper comments and docstrings following RST format.
- Fixed typos and formatting issues.
- Added more detailed error handling.


**Explanation of Changes:**

The most significant changes are the addition of type hints and improved error handling. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and robust.  The use of `try...except` blocks helps to gracefully handle potential errors when loading the settings and README files, preventing the script from crashing if these files are missing or have incorrect format.  Using `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` is critical for properly handling JSON data and preventing potential errors.

**Important Considerations:**

- **`src.utils.jjson`:** The code assumes that a module named `src.utils.jjson` with functions `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` exists and is importable.  If this module doesn't exist, add the import statements or provide a dummy implementation for these functions.

- **Testing:** Add unit tests (using `pytest`, for example) to thoroughly test the `get_project_root` function and other parts of the code, especially with different scenarios (e.g., files missing, incorrect file formats).


This revised code is more robust and follows best practices for Python development, particularly when handling potentially problematic files and paths. Remember to adapt it further to the actual structure and needs of your project. Remember to add the import `from typing import Tuple` in the correct place if it's not already present in your file.
