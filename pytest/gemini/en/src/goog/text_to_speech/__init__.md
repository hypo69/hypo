**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_tts_object_creation`:**  This test is crucial.  It verifies that the `TTS` object is created and importantly, checks if the `pyttsx3` engine (`_tts`) is initialized. This prevents a common error where `TTS` could be instantiated, but the underlying engine isn't properly configured.

2. **`test_tts_voice_info`:** This test addresses the problematic printing.  Directly testing `print` output is extremely difficult in pytest.   The current test is a placeholder.  **If the goal is to verify the voice information is retrieved and printed correctly, you need to refactor the code to return the list of voices instead of printing it.**  Then a test like this could work.

3. **`test_tts_invalid_init_arg`:** This test covers an essential edge case: what happens when the `__init__` method is called with unexpected input types.  In this case, it tests with an integer as input.   Adding tests like this is crucial for robustness.

4. **No Tests on `_tts` attributes**:  The code has an `_tts` attribute.  Tests on that would test internal implementation details.  That is usually avoided.


**Crucial Considerations for Future Tests:**

* **Refactor printing:** Change the `__init__` method to return the list of voices instead of printing it directly. This will make testing the retrieval logic significantly easier.  Then add a test to check the returned list (is it a list? does it contain the expected data?).

* **`gTTS` Integration (if used):** If the `gTTS` library is used for any actual text-to-speech conversion, add tests for that functionality.  That would involve input validation, output checks, and likely separate tests to ensure interaction between `pyttsx3` and `gTTS`.


**Example of a `__init__` refactor (for testing voice information):**

```python
class TTS():
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._tts = pyttsx3.init()
        self.voices = self._tts.getProperty('voices') # Added to store the voices list
        # ... Other initialization ...

# Modified test (to show how you'd test the refactor):
def test_tts_voice_info():
    tts_object = TTS()
    assert isinstance(tts_object.voices, list) # Test if the list was returned
    assert len(tts_object.voices) > 0 # Verify if the list is not empty.
```


This revised set of tests is more comprehensive and addresses the limitations of testing the original code. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functionality of your code.   The missing `gTTS` integration is a critical area that should be addressed. Remember to add more specific tests with various edge cases.
