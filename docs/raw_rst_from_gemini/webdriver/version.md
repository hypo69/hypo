**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Variable assignment:** The `=` sign is used directly in the assignment of the variables. This is the standard Python way of assigning values to variables, and it's more concise than using `__version__: str = 'v1.1'`.

* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Python code should follow PEP 8 style guide for readability.  The corrected code adheres to this by having variables in lowercase, using correct spacing, and making the code more compact.

* **Docstrings:** While the original had docstrings, they were empty.  It's a good practice to include informative docstrings explaining the purpose of the module.


**Example of how to use the module (hypothetical):**

```python
import hypotez.src.webdriver.version as version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__author__)
print(version.__copyright__)
```

This revised version is more Pythonic and follows best practices. Remember to put this file in the correct `hypotez/src/webdriver` directory structure within your project for it to be imported correctly.
