```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the input and expected outcome.
* **Specific Assertions:** Instead of just `assert`, use more specific assertions like `isinstance` to check data types and `assert data == expected_data` to verify content.
* **Error Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used to check for `FileNotFoundError`.
* **Mock Data (Crucial):** The example now includes `test_spreadsheet_read_valid` and `test_reach_spreadsheet_get_data_valid` that show how to mock valid data or access dummy data to avoid hard dependency on external files. *This is crucial for unit testing!*  You need to mock/generate data within your tests because you cannot reliably depend on the existence of external files.
* **Empty Data Handling**: `test_reach_spreadsheet_get_data_no_data` tests an edge case where no data is available, which is important.
* **Fixture Example**:  A `spreadsheet_data` fixture is included as an example of how to manage data for multiple tests.
* **Complete Example**:  The `test_spreadsheet_read_with_fixture_data` shows how to test with a fixture, and how to write to a dummy spreadsheet for the test.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_spreadsheet.py`).
2.  Make sure the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet` module is in your Python path or use a proper import path.
3.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_spreadsheet.py`

Remember to replace placeholder file paths ("test_spreadsheet.xlsx") with the correct paths to your spreadsheet files or use a mock file system. Also, adapt the test assertions and expected data to match the actual structure and functionality of your `SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` classes. This improved solution demonStartes best practices and covers various test scenarios.
