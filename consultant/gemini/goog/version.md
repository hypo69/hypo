__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''  # Corrected spelling
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is the `try...except` block now properly catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Importantly, it now prints an informative error message to the console using an f-string,  `print(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")`.  This is vital for debugging.  Without this, if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the script will silently fail, which is a bad practice.

2. **Corrected spelling:** Fixed the typo in `__copyright__` from `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.

3. **Explicit type hints:** The type hints are already correct (`settings: dict`), but it's good practice.

4. **Default Values:** The code now uses default values for variables which are fine. If `settings.json` is missing, or if a key is missing, the script still works.

**How to use:**

This `version.py` file should now be importable into other parts of your project and can be used to access information about the project using these variables:

```python
import goog.version

print(goog.version.__version__)
print(goog.version.__project_name__)
```

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2023, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```


By incorporating error handling and informative error messages, the code is significantly more robust and useful in a real-world project. Remember to place `settings.json` in the correct location relative to `version.py`.
