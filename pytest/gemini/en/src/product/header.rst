```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for creating test data:** The `project_root` fixture now creates the necessary `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `src/settings.json` files within a temporary directory using `tmp_path`. This ensures that each test runs in an isolated environment. The `settings_json` fixture creates the required `settings.json` file.  The `readme_md` fixture creates the necessary `README.MD` file.
2. **More comprehensive test cases:** The test suite now covers various scenarios, including cases where marker files are present, but not in the immediate directory, the case where no marker files are found, the presence of multiple marker files, and cases with files located in parent directories.
3. **Exception handling:** A test (`test_settings_loading_missing_file`) is added to verify the expected behavior when `settings.json` is missing. This uses `pytest.raises` to assert that a `FileNotFoundError` is caught during loading.
4. **Clearer test descriptions:** Test function names are more descriptive, clearly indicating the input and expected outcome of each test.
5. **Correct imports:** All the imports are now corrected, allowing the test suite to run correctly.
6. **Modular Test Cases:** Tests are organized to better handle different test cases in a single file.


This improved test suite provides a more robust set of tests that cover a broader range of potential issues, making your code more reliable and easier to maintain.  Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with the actual package name if different. Remember to install the `pytest` and `packaging` libraries if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
