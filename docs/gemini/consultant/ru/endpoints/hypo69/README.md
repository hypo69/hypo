### **endpoints Module**: Final Consumer Endpoints

The **endpoints** module serves as a collection of endpoint modules that interact with external services and systems, acting as the main interface for data exchange with final consumers. It includes the following submodules:

1. **PrestaShop**  
   Provides integration with the PrestaShop e-commerce platform, supporting functions such as product and order management, allowing seamless data exchange between the application and the PrestaShop system.

2. **bots**  
   Manages bot integrations, including support for platforms like Telegram and Discord, enabling user interaction, command processing, and messaging functionalities.

3. **emil**  
   A submodule designed for integration with the data supplier Emil, facilitating data collection, processing, and synchronization.

4. **kazarinov**  
   Integrates with the data supplier Kazarinov, supporting data gathering and processing requirements specific to this providerâ€™s systems and data structure.
```

**Improved Code**

```python
# endpoints/__init__.py

# endpoints/__init__.py
"""
Module endpoints.

This module contains endpoints for interacting with external services.
It includes submodules for specific platforms like PrestaShop, bots, Emil, and Kazarinov.
"""

# ... (imports, if any, should go here)
# ...
from src.logger import logger

# ... (other code, if any)


# Example Usage (Illustrative only)
# The following section is not part of the original code and shows example usages of endpoints
# from endpoints.prestashop import manage_products

# try:
#     manage_products()
# except Exception as e:
#     logger.error(f"Error in PrestaShop endpoint: {e}")

```

**Changes Made**

- Added a module docstring in RST format for the `endpoints` module.
- Added placeholder imports (`# ... (imports, if any, should go here)`).  Real imports would depend on what external modules this uses.
- Added a `from src.logger import logger` import statement for logging.
- Added an example usage block with a `try-except` block that demonstrates how to use the endpoint and log errors, using `logger.error`. This section is a suggestion, and the original code doesn't have any code to use.
