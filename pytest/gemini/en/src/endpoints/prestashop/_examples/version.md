**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names now clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_value`).

2. **Import Statements:** The tests now correctly import the necessary variables from the `version.py` file using `from ... import ...`.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover the string type and values of `__version__`, `__author__`, `__details__`, `MODE`.

4. **Explicit Assertions:**  Each test asserts the expected type and value, enhancing clarity and correctness.

5. **Handling `__name__`:**  Includes a test for `__name__` specifically checking its type, though how you use it will determine further assertion.

6. **Docstrings:** Each test function includes a descriptive docstring that explains its purpose.

7. **Edge Case Handling:** While the given `version.py` doesn't have obvious edge cases, the test structure is ready to handle them.

8. **Type Checking:** The tests now explicitly check the type of variables, which is crucial for robustness.

9. **Handling `__doc__` and `__annotations__`:** Included tests for `__doc__` checking its type or `None`, and a similar test for `__annotations__`.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_version.py`

This improved test suite provides a more comprehensive and robust way to verify the functionality of `version.py`, addressing potential issues and ensuring the quality of the code. Remember to adapt the assertions to match the intended behavior and use cases for the variables being tested if needed. If a variable is intended for other uses in other parts of the code, the test suite can be adapted to account for these variations. For example, if `__name__` would be used in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the assertion in the test could be adjusted to account for the usage.
