**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Instead of modifying `sys.path`, which can be problematic and lead to unexpected side effects, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `openai_utils` module and the `client` function.  This is a much safer and more reliable way to test the code without relying on external dependencies.


* **Clearer Error Handling:** The test cases now use `pytest.raises` to specifically test for the expected `AssertionError` when the response is `None`, making the test more robust and readable.  It also makes sure the error message matches the expected one.


* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover valid, empty, and no-content responses, as well as the edge case of a `None` response (using pytest.raises for the exception).


* **`@pytest.fixture`:** A `mock_openai_client_response` fixture provides a controlled response.


* **`monkeypatch`:** Added `monkeypatch` in the tests for replacing the `openai_utils.client` function within the test context. This is a more correct and cleaner approach than modifying `sys.path`.


* **`testing_utils`:**  The assumption is that `create_test_system_user_message` is defined in the `testing_utils` module. If not, you need to provide that definition for the tests to work correctly.

This revised solution addresses the critical issues of mocking, improved error handling, and comprehensive testing, making it a much more robust and reliable test suite. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`).  Also ensure the `testing_utils` module is properly set up. Finally, make sure you have a mock for `create_test_system_user_message` function if that function isn't provided already.
