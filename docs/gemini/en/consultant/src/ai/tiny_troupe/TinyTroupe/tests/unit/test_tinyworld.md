# Changes Made

- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` (assuming `jjson` module exists).
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) to all functions, methods, and classes for better readability and maintainability.
- Improved comments for clarity and replaced vague terms like "get" and "do" with more precise ones.
- Corrected `sys.path.append('..\')` to `sys.path.append('../')` to fix the import path error.
- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.
- Docstrings are formatted according to Python docstring conventions.
- Added a `TODO` item for the stimulus integrity check.
