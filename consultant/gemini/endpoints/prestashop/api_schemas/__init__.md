# Add imports for schemas here, e.g.:
# from .order import OrderSchema  
# from .product import ProductSchema
# ...


# Example: If you want to export the schemas globally:
# schemas = {
#     "order": OrderSchema,
#     "product": ProductSchema,
# }

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The original code was just a stub. This improved version:

1. **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose of the module and the schemas it's expected to contain.  This is crucial for maintainability.

2. **Import Statements:** Included placeholder import statements (`from .order import OrderSchema`, etc.).  These are *essential* if you intend to define schema classes in submodules within `api_schemas`.  The commented-out example demonstrates how you might export the schemas as a dictionary for easier access elsewhere in your application.

3. **Structure:**  The code is now more structured and ready to be expanded.  You should create submodules (e.g., `order.py`, `product.py`) within the `api_schemas` folder, defining the actual schema classes for different API resources.


**How to use it:**

1.  **Create submodules:** Create files like `order.py`, `product.py` (or any other resource schemas) inside the `api_schemas` directory.

2.  **Define schemas:** Define your schemas using a library like `marshmallow` (or other suitable schema validation libraries) in these submodules.

3.  **Import and use:**  In other parts of your application, import the schema classes you've created from this `__init__.py` file.

**Example (order.py):**

```python
from marshmallow import Schema, fields

class OrderSchema(Schema):
    id = fields.Integer()
    customer_id = fields.Integer()
    total_amount = fields.Float()
    # ... other fields
```

**Example Usage (in another part of your application):**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api_schemas import OrderSchema
from your_prestashop_api_resource import get_order  # Replace with your API call

order_data = get_order(123)
schema = OrderSchema()
try:
    order_json = schema.dump(order_data)
    print(order_json)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error dumping order data: {e}")
```

This revised solution is much more robust and usable, addressing the crucial missing elements of the original code. Remember to install the `marshmallow` library if you haven't already (`pip install marshmallow`).


This improved structure and clear example guide you through defining and utilizing these schemas in your project, making your code maintainable and your API robust. Remember to adapt the schema structures to your specific PrestaShop API requirements. Remember to replace placeholders like `OrderSchema` and `get_order` with your actual schema names and data access functions.
