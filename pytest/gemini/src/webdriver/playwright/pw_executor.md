```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Function Names:**  Function names (`test_mode_constant`, `test_mode_invalid_value`) clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Explicit Assertions:** The tests now use `assert` statements to verify the expected behavior.  Crucially, we check `MODE`'s type and potential valid values.

3. **Error Handling (Edge Case):** The `test_mode_invalid_value` function demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions when an invalid value is assigned to `MODE`.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover the fact that `MODE` must be a string and that there are legitimate possible values.  This is important because the previous response lacked comprehensive checking for valid values and types.

5. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:**  No fixtures were used because the `MODE` constant is a simple variable. If the original code was using external functions and data structures, we would've needed fixtures.

6. **Commented Test Cases:** Clear comments explain the purpose of each test case.

7. **Important Note:**  The commented-out example of `test_mode_usage` and the fixture  `some_external_dependency` is a placeholder. If the original `pw_executor.py` code interacts with external libraries, you would need to define appropriate fixtures and test those interactions using the external dependencies.  


**How to Run:**

Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_pw_executor.py`). Then run pytest from your terminal:

```bash
pytest test_pw_executor.py
```

This will execute the tests and report any failures.


This improved solution provides a robust and comprehensive testing strategy for the given Python code snippet. Remember to adapt these tests if the original `pw_executor.py` code has more complex logic, dependencies, or methods. Remember to uncomment the test with the external dependencies if that is applicable.
