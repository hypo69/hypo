**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Objects:** The code now uses mock objects (`MockDriver`, `MockFacebookPromoter`, `MockChrome`) to isolate the tests from the external dependencies (like `Driver`, `Chrome`, and the `FacebookPromoter` class).  This is crucial for unit testing.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive and informative, indicating the input scenario (valid, invalid).

3. **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test for expected exceptions (e.g., if `run_campaign` is called with incorrect arguments).

4. **Mocking `get_directory_names`:** The `get_directory_names` function is mocked to provide predictable results for testing.

5. **Complete `run_campaign` Test:** The `test_run_campaign_valid_input` now verifies that the `run_campaign` function runs successfully with valid inputs without raising any exceptions.

6. **`campaign_cycle` Test:** The `test_campaign_cycle` now demonstrates a proper test for the `campaign_cycle` function. The `test_campaign_cycle_invalid_language` tests an exceptional case to check the response of the function when it is given an incorrect language.


**Crucial Considerations for Real Implementation:**

* **Replace Mocks with Actual Dependencies:**  Once the actual `FacebookPromoter`, `Driver`, `Chrome` classes and the external dependencies work properly, replace the `Mock` classes in your tests with their proper implementations.

* **Additional `run_campaign` Tests:**  Add more tests for different input types and cases for `run_campaign` to cover potential errors and unexpected behavior. For example, tests for missing files, invalid campaign names, etc.

* **`campaign_cycle` Test Improvement:**  A better `test_campaign_cycle` would ideally simulate the logic of loading campaigns from files (with mock data). This will test the correct path selection for `group_file_paths` based on language and the correct execution of `run_campaign` for various campaigns.

* **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive tests for error cases in the `campaign_cycle` function.  Check what happens when `run_campaign` fails.

* **Data-Driven Tests:**  If the logic within `campaign_cycle` depends on external data loaded from files, consider data-driven tests (e.g., using `pytest.mark.parametrize`) to test with various scenarios of that data to verify more aspects of the program's behavior.

This significantly improved test suite provides a better starting point to fully verify the code's correctness and robustness. Remember to adapt the tests to use the actual classes and functions instead of mocks when they are ready. Remember to add more tests to cover the different paths and error conditions within the code.
