**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid URLs with multiple parameters, URLs with a single parameter, URLs with no parameters, invalid URLs, malformed URLs, empty strings, URLs with special characters, URLs without a protocol, and edge cases.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.
* **`pytest.raises` (Removed):**  `pytest.raises` wasn't needed for the original `extract_url_params` function, as it's expected to return `None` rather than raise an exception for invalid URLs.
* **Using `parse_qs` correctly:** The tests now correctly handle cases where a parameter has a single value.
* **`is_url` Test Cases:** The `is_url` test cases are significantly improved and more comprehensive now, testing valid URLs, invalid URLs, empty strings, and URLs with special characters.  Crucially, it now tests malformed URLs and URLs without a protocol.
* **Example Usage (test_example_usage):** This shows how to use the functions in practice but is NOT a test case itself (it's commented appropriately).


This revised solution is much more thorough in its testing, covering a wider range of inputs and expected behaviors, adhering better to the principles of robust testing. Remember to save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_url.py`) in the same directory as your `url.py` file and run `pytest test_url.py` to execute the tests. Also, make sure your `hypotez` project has the necessary libraries installed, as indicated in the `requirements.txt`.
