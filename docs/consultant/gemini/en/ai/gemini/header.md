**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints for `get_project_root` function.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for loading JSON data. This is more robust and handles potential errors.
- Included `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions during file loading. This prevents the script from crashing.
- Improved error messages to provide more context.
- Corrected the variable name `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Changed string formatting to f-strings for improved readability.
- Added missing imports.


**Explanation of Changes:**

The provided code was enhanced to adhere to the prompt's instructions more closely. The crucial changes involve employing `j_loads` for JSON file handling, which enhances error handling and prevents program crashes. The `try...except` blocks are critical for robustness, providing informative error messages and allowing the program to continue running instead of abruptly halting. These improvements make the code more reliable and user-friendly in real-world applications.
