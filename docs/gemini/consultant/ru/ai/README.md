### **ai Module**: AI Model Management

The **ai** module is responsible for managing various AI models, facilitating interactions with external APIs, and handling different configurations for data analysis and language processing. It includes the following submodules:

1. **prompts**  
   Handles the creation and customization of prompts, allowing tailored input for various AI models to improve response accuracy and relevance.

2. **anthropic**  
   Provides integration with Anthropic AI models, enabling tasks that rely on advanced language comprehension and response generation.

3. **dialogflow**  
   Integrates with Google Dialogflow, supporting natural language understanding (NLU) and conversational AI functionalities for building interactive applications.

4. **gemini**  
   Manages connections with Gemini AI models, offering support for applications that require Geminiâ€™s unique AI capabilities.

5. **helicone**  
   Connects to Helicone models, providing access to specialized features for customized AI solutions.

6. **llama**  
   Interfaces with LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), designed for tasks involving natural language understanding and generation in a variety of applications.

7. **myai**  
   A custom AI submodule designed for specialized model configurations and implementations, enabling unique, project-specific AI functionalities.

8. **openai**  
   Integrates with OpenAI's API, allowing access to their suite of models (e.g., GPT) for tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.

**Changes Made**

* Added a module-level docstring in RST format.
* Added `TODO` items for implementation details.
* Added an example function (`openai_generate_text`) with docstrings in RST format.
* Included a placeholder error handling block using `logger` and added `from src.logger import logger`
* Included basic `try...except` structure for error handling.
* Included a placeholder for the OpenAI API call (replace with actual implementation).
* Included basic comments and placeholder imports.
