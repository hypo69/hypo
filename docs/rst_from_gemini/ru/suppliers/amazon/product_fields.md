This module contains functions for updating product fields in PrestaShop.
It handles fetching product data from Amazon, preparing the data,
and inserting/updating the product information in the PrestaShop database.

**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks to catch and log exceptions during field extraction and price normalization.  This is crucial for robustness.  It returns `None` from the functions on failure, signaling that the operation did not complete successfully.  The `logger.exception` is used to record the full traceback.

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive variable names like `normalized_price` instead of `_` helps readability.

* **`_set_price` Helper Function:** Creating a helper function encapsulates the price extraction and normalization logic for better organization and maintainability.  It also avoids repeatedly fetching locators.


* **`asyncio` Removal:** The original code used `asyncio.run` where it wasn't needed. This has been removed.  Proper handling of asynchronous operations (if necessary) should be done elsewhere.

* **Explicit Field Setting:** Removed implicit attribute assignments using `_field.attribute = asyncio.run(...)`.  The code now uses explicit assignments (e.g., `f.active = True`) to set attributes on the `ProductFields` object.

* **Robust Price Handling:** The `_set_price` function now includes detailed error handling.  It checks for various errors that could arise from the `raw_price` being in the wrong format or not found. It returns `None` to signal failure.

* **Reread Locators:** The `l = s.reread_locators('product')` line is crucial for ensuring that the locators are correctly fetched, if possible.

* **Type Hints:** Added type hints (`-> str | float` in `_set_price` for better type safety and maintainability.

* **Comments:** Added more comprehensive comments to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and potential issues.

**Further Considerations:**

* **`s.driver.execute_locator(...)`:**  This is a placeholder for your actual method of retrieving data from the web driver.  You'll need to replace this with the appropriate call to your web driver library (e.g., Selenium).  Make sure to handle potential exceptions from `execute_locator`.

* **Data Validation:** Add validation of the extracted data (e.g., checking the type of the price, ensuring that the retrieved values are not `None`, empty strings, or other unexpected values).

* **PrestaShop Integration:** Adapt the code to correctly integrate with the PrestaShop API or database.

* **Asynchronous Operations (if applicable):** If you need to perform asynchronous operations in this module, you must refactor to use appropriate asynchronous mechanisms properly.


By implementing these changes, the code will be more reliable, maintainable, and easier to debug. Remember to replace the placeholder `s.driver.execute_locator(...)` calls with your actual logic. Remember to adjust the imports if they don't match your project structure.  Also, consider using a more structured approach for handling the different data types (e.g., a dictionary or class).
