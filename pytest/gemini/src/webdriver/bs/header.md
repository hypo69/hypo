```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `settings_file` and `readme_file` fixtures to create temporary `settings.json` and `README.MD` files for testing purposes. This allows you to control the contents of these files, ensuring clean and repeatable tests.
* **`tmp_path`:** Correctly use `tmp_path` from `pytest` to create temporary directories. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other and clean up temporary files.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests covering valid inputs (multiple marker files, files in different directories), missing marker files, empty marker files, and edge cases.
* **Error Handling:** Included tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` using `pytest.raises`.  These are crucial for robustness.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test function names for better readability and understanding.
* **Correct File Paths:** Adjusted the test to use `Path` objects consistently for file paths, which is essential for portability.
* **Explicit assertions:** Made assertions explicit.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases, error handling, and the use of temporary files for testing. Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with the actual path of your project.  Additionally, adapt the test fixtures if needed.  The `root_dir` fixture isn't needed if you're mocking `gs.path.root` to a known temporary path inside the tests.
