**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better describe the test's purpose.
* **Explicit Assertions:** Uses `assert` statements for clear verification of expected results.
* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during element finding and URL retrieval, preventing tests from failing silently.
* **More Robust Tests:** Includes tests for invalid URLs and cases where an element might not be found, making the tests more comprehensive.
* **Fixture:** A `chrome_driver` fixture is defined to create and manage the driver instance for each test. This prevents redundant driver creation and keeps tests independent.
* **`pytest.raises` (Important):**  Crucially,  the provided code doesn't explicitly use `selenium`. I can't create exception tests for `selenium`-related errors (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`, `InvalidSessionIdException`) without knowing the structure of the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes.


**How to Run:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as `test_driver.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `driver.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_driver.py`

**Important Considerations (for real-world applications):**

*   **Dependencies:** The tests now use `pytest` which is crucial for proper testing and organization.
*   **Context:** To make these tests truly robust you'd need to know the internal workings of the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes, and the implementation details of methods like `get_url`, `find_element`, etc. 
*   **Error Handling:** The example error handling is a start.  More comprehensive error handling should be added that checks for specific exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`, `TimeoutException`, `InvalidSelectorException`) to make tests more informative if those exceptions occur during the test.
* **`setUp` and `tearDown`:** For tests that require more setup or cleanup (like creating temporary files or closing the driver), consider `setUp` and `tearDown` methods in a test class. This helps organize your tests better.



Remember to replace `src.webdriver.Driver` and `src.webdriver.Chrome` with the actual import paths if they are not in the `src` folder. Also, replace `"https://www.example.com"` with actual URLs for testing (if necessary).  This improved solution addresses potential issues with the code, provides more realistic tests, and demonstrates how to test the actual behavior of the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes. Remember to replace placeholders (`https://www.example.com`) with more meaningful test URLs for a more robust test suite.
