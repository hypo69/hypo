**Explanation of Improvements and Key Considerations:**

* **`@pytest.fixture`:**  A `chrome_driver` fixture is introduced to create a fresh driver instance for each test. This isolates tests and avoids potential state issues.
* **Valid/Invalid URLs:** Tests for both valid and invalid URLs (e.g., `test_get_url_invalid`).  Crucially, these tests now check for the *correct* return value (True/False), not just the absence of exceptions.
* **`NoSuchElementException` Handling:**  A `try...except` block is used in `test_find_element_success` to catch the expected exception and fail the test if the element isn't found.  `test_find_element_failure` now uses `pytest.raises` to assert that `NoSuchElementException` is raised for a non-existent element.  This is crucial to properly test exception handling.
* **Mocking/Simulating Page Loads:**  The `chrome_driver.get_url("https://www.example.com")` lines in the test functions are critical.  They simulate the page load before interacting with page elements, ensuring that tests are more realistic and less prone to failures due to timing issues.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more specific (e.g., checking if the extracted domain is correct).
* **Edge Cases:** Tests for invalid URLs (`test_extract_domain_invalid_url`) and non-existent elements (`test_find_element_failure`) were added as necessary.


**Before Running:**

- **Install necessary packages:**
```bash
pip install pytest selenium
```

- **Replace placeholders:** Make sure the `src.webdriver.driver` and `src.webdriver.chrome` modules exist with the actual implementation of the `Driver` and `Chrome` classes.

This revised solution provides a significantly more comprehensive and robust test suite for your `driver` and `chrome` classes. Remember to adapt the tests further based on the specific expected behavior and error handling in your actual code.  If `_save_cookies_locally` doesn't have a well-defined success/failure mechanism, modify the `test_save_cookies_localy` test to reflect the actual behavior of your function. Always verify that your `chrome_driver` instance is correctly closing the webdriver session at the end of the test or within the test fixtures (e.g. using `driver.quit()` in your `chrome_driver` fixture).
