**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Objects:** The code now uses `mock_driver` and `mock_locators` fixtures to avoid interacting with a real web driver, which is crucial for unit testing. The `MockDriver` class mocks the necessary driver methods and `MockElement` mocks the element return from `find()`.  This is critical for isolation and avoids external dependencies.


2. **Clear Error Handling:** The tests now include examples of how to assert that the correct exception is raised when invalid input is provided (e.g., missing locator, invalid email).  This is much better than just expecting something to crash.


3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The provided examples cover valid input and one case where a crucial locator might be missing.  You need to expand on this to test other potential error conditions based on your actual implementation (missing passwords, incorrect element types, etc.).

4. **Data-Driven Tests (Optional):**  For more extensive tests, consider using parameterized tests with pytest. This would allow you to quickly run tests with various email/password combinations or different locator types.


**How to use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Update the `mock_locators` fixture with the actual locators and data you're using.
2. **Implement Error Handling:** Add more specific exception handling to your `login` function in the original code to return meaningful errors.
3. **Expand Test Cases:** Add more tests for scenarios like incorrect password formats, missing login buttons, exceptions during navigation, and various locator types.


This revised solution provides a solid framework for testing the `login` function with proper mocking, exception handling, and comprehensive test cases. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific implementation details of the `login` function and its error handling. Remember to add tests for various locator types and strategies.
