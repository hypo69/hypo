This code defines a subclass of `PlaywrightCrawler` called `Playwrid`.
It provides additional functionality such as the ability to set custom browser settings,
profiles, and launch options using Playwright.

```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes crucial error handling.  It checks if the `playwrid.json` file exists, and raises a `FileNotFoundError` if it doesn't.  The `__init__` method now catches and re-raises the error to be handled appropriately by the caller. This is *essential* for robust code, especially when dealing with external resources.


* **Clearer Variable Names:** The use of more descriptive variable names improves readability (`settings_name` instead of just `name`).


* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints for better code clarity and maintainability.


* **Proper Logger:** Import `logger` from the correct location (`from src.logger import logger`). This ensures that the logger is functioning correctly.


* **`super().run()`:**  The crucial `super().run()` is used to actually start the Playwright crawling process.


* **`current_url` Property:** The `current_url` property is implemented to provide a way to retrieve the current URL being visited by the Playwright browser.



**How to Use:**

1.  **Configuration:** Ensure you have a `playwrid.json` file (or a custom one specified by `settings_name`) in the correct directory structure as defined in the code.

2.  **Example Usage (in another python file):**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.playwrid import Playwrid

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        browser = Playwrid(settings_name="custom_settings")  # Use custom settings if needed
        browser.start("https://www.example.com")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:  # Catch other exceptions
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```


This revised solution is significantly more robust, readable, and maintainable. Remember to install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Playwright, Crawlee). Remember to replace placeholders like `gs.path` and `src` with your actual project structure. Remember to configure logging appropriately before running.
