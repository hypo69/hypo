**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for `FileNotFoundError` and other expected exceptions, making the tests more robust.  The error messages are also checked for more precise matches.
* **Temporary Files:** The tests create and delete temporary DOT and PNG files. This avoids cluttering the test environment and ensures that tests are independent.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions (`assert os.path.exists(...)`) are clearer about what is being verified.
* **Edge Case (`test_dot2png_invalid_dot_file`):** Tests the case where the DOT file doesn't exist.
* **Clean-up:** Crucial addition of `os.remove()` to delete the temporary files after the tests. This prevents test failures due to leftover files in later tests.
* **Command-line Argument Test (`test_dot2png_wrong_number_of_commandline_arguments`):** A test case that specifically checks the SystemExit exception when the wrong number of command line arguments is provided to the program. This demonStartes the robustness of the tests and proper exception handling, important for production code.
* **Realistic test (`test_dot2png_valid_dot_file_real`):** Includes a real-world test with an actual `example.dot` file, but only if one is present. You should replace `"example.dot"` with the actual path if you have a file. This validates that the conversion works with real-world data.
* **Large File Test (commented out):** Added a placeholder for a large file test, which is beneficial for ensuring that the code handles files of varying sizes. This test would be particularly useful if you anticipate a large number of users using the tool or if the processing time becomes a concern with large files.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_dot2png.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_dot2png.py`

Remember to create a file named `example.dot` in the same directory as the test file, with valid DOT language content, to run `test_dot2png_valid_dot_file_real`. Otherwise, that test will fail. Also remove `output.png` from the directory if it was generated by a previous test run. If `example.dot` is not created, the test will fail.
