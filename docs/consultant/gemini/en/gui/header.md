**Changes Made**:

- Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` to use the provided JSON loading functions.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
- Added a `try...except` block for file loading and included a `print` statement for error messages.  Improved error handling to catch potential errors.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `project_root` instead of `__root__`).
- Used f-strings for better readability.
- Docstrings updated to follow RST formatting strictly, including type hints.
- Added a comment to handle logging for better error tracing.
- Improved code structure and readability.



**Note**: This assumes the existence of `src/utils/jjson.py` containing the functions `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns`.  If these functions are not available, you need to add them for the code to run properly. Also, consider using a logging framework (like `logging`) for more robust error handling.   A complete `jjson` example is not given, but it is assumed it exists elsewhere in the project.
