```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Temporary Directories:** Introduced `dummy_project_root` to create a temporary directory structure for testing purposes. This isolates tests and prevents interference between runs. It also ensures that the `settings.json` file is correctly created within the project root. The test suite now sets up a temporary test project correctly, which is crucial for testing the `set_project_root` function.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive, clearly indicating the input and expected outcome.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests for missing marker files, invalid marker file types (trying to find a directory instead of a file), and cases where the marker files are not found at all. The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files_found` is now correctly using `tmp_path` for the temporary directory.
* **Exception Handling:**  A test for failure cases where `settings.json` is missing (FileNotFoundError) or corrupted (JSONDecodeError). Now tests loading from `README.MD` using a fixture.
* **Robustness with `sys.path`:** The `test_set_project_root_syspath_insertion` verifies that the function correctly modifies `sys.path`.
* **Using `assert` instead of `True/False`:**  Uses assertions to directly check the expected outcomes, making tests more readable and maintainable.
* **`temp_settings_json` Fixture:** Creates and manages the `settings.json` file within the test environment for more controlled testing. This fixture is now used to avoid issues when loading the file.
* **`temp_readme_md` Fixture:** Similarly, manages the `README.MD` file for testing.
* **Clearer Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic of each test case.
* **Valid Project Structure:** Tests that a valid project structure (with `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git`) correctly finds the root directory.

This improved solution addresses all the requirements and provides a more complete test suite for `set_project_root`. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pytest`, `packaging`, and `pathlib`. Remember to run `pytest` in the directory containing your test file.
