   Manages bot integrations, supporting platforms like Telegram and Discord.  This facilitates user interaction, command processing, and messaging functionalities.

3. **emil**
   Provides integration with the data supplier Emil, facilitating data collection, processing, and synchronization.  Clarify the *specific* data types and formats exchanged.

4. **kazarinov**
   Integrates with the data supplier Kazarinov, supporting data gathering and processing tailored to their systems and data structure. Specify the *nature* of the data from Kazarinov and how it's processed.
