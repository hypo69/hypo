How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` to locate the root directory of a project.  It then reads project settings from a `settings.json` file and documentation from a `README.MD` file located relative to the project root. Finally, it initializes several variables with values from the settings or defaults.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules: `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, and `packaging.version`.  It also imports the `gs` module from the `src` package, likely a module defining paths within the project.

2. The `set_project_root` function is defined. It takes an optional `marker_files` parameter (a tuple of filenames or directories).  This function searches upwards from the current file's directory for directories containing any of the specified marker files. This efficiently determines the project root directory.

3. The function initializes `current_path` to the parent directory of the script's file. It iterates through parent directories up to the root and checks if any marker file exists within them. If a marker file is found, it sets `__root__` to that directory and breaks the loop.

4. If `__root__` is not already in `sys.path`, it adds it to the start of the list. This allows Python to import modules from the project directory.

5. The `__root__` variable is assigned the result of calling `set_project_root()`, obtaining the path to the project root.

6. The code attempts to open and load the `settings.json` file located in the `src` folder of the project root. If successful, the `settings` dictionary is populated with the loaded data. If any error (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) occurs during the loading process, `settings` is left as `None`.


7. Similarly, the code attempts to open and read the `README.MD` file to store the documentation string.  If any error occurs, `doc_str` remains `None`.


8.  The code initializes several variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`). These variables obtain their values from the `settings` dictionary if available, or use default values if `settings` is `None` or the key isn't found.  The `__cofee__` variable sets a default link if there is no associated value.

9. The code returns the `__root__` variable, which contains the path to the project's root directory.



Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have the necessary modules installed (packaging, etc.) and
    # have a project structure similar to the provided code.
    from pathlib import Path
    from hypotez.src.logger.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage, replacing 'your_script.py' with the actual file name.
    script_path = Path(__file__).resolve()  # Replace with your script path
    root_dir = set_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt'))

    print(f"Project root directory: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")  # Example use of the returned variable
