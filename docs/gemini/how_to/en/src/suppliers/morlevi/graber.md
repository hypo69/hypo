.. module: src.suppliers.morlevi
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class collects product field values from the `morlevi.co.il` product page.
    Each field on the product page has a processing function in the parent class.
    If non-standard processing is required, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, you need to pass a value
    to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines and redefine its behavior.

**Explanation of Improvements and Key Concepts:**

1. **`_fetch_data` function:** This function now centralizes the fetching of all data points. The key change is avoiding using `kwargs` *inside* the loop.  Instead, use the dictionary-based approach, making it easier to pass necessary arguments.

2. **`asyncio.gather`:**  Use `asyncio.gather` to run all the field-fetching functions concurrently. This dramatically improves efficiency, particularly for complex websites.

3. **Type Hinting:** The code now uses type hints (`from typing import ...`) throughout, improving readability and maintainability.

4. **Error Handling:**  Added a `try...except` block around `save_png` to handle potential errors during image saving. Logging is crucial for debugging.

5. **Concise Field Fetching:** The example field functions are now directly using the arguments passed by `asyncio.gather` instead of individual `kwargs`.  This is safer and cleaner.

6. **Removed Redundancy:**  The example fetch functions now fetch data more efficiently.

**How to Use (Example):**

```python
# ... (Your setup code)

async def main():
    driver = await Driver.create_driver()
    graber = Graber(driver)

    # ... (Setting values of self.fields, id_product, etc.)

    fields = await graber.grab_page(driver)
    print(fields.local_saved_image) # access your fields

# ... (rest of your application code)
```

**Crucial Considerations:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  The example `local_saved_image` function is just a starting point. You'll need to replace it with your actual field fetching logic.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your individual field functions (`id_product`, etc.) to catch potential exceptions and log them appropriately.

By following these guidelines and replacing the examples with your actual code, you'll create a highly efficient and maintainable data extraction process.  Remember to handle the various potential errors during the process with try-except blocks and appropriate logging.
