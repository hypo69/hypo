    :synopsis: This module defines custom exceptions used in the application.

Program Exceptions
------------------

This module contains several custom exception classes to handle errors related to various application components, including file operations, product fields, KeePass database connections, and PrestaShop WebService errors.

Classes:
--------
- CustomException: The base custom exception class that handles logging.
- FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file is not found.
- ProductFieldException: Raised for errors related to product fields.
- KeePassException: Raised for errors related to KeePass database connections.
- DefaultSettingsException: Raised for when there are issues with default settings.
- WebDriverException: Raised for errors related to WebDriver.
- ExecuteLocatorException: Raised for errors related to locator executors.
- PrestaShopException: Raised for generic PrestaShop WebService errors.
- PrestaShopAuthenticationError: Raised for authentication errors with PrestaShop WebServices.

**Improvements:**

* **PrestaShopException Enhanced:**
    * Inherits from `CustomException`: This correctly propagates the exception handling from the base class.  Critically, it correctly logs the exception information, including the original one if available.  The original `__str__` method was not ideal for informative error reporting
    *  More informative `__str__` method: This now returns a multiline string with the original message, any PrestaShop error message, and the corresponding error codes. This makes debugging much easier.
    * `exc_info` argument passed to the `__init__` method: This ensures that the relevant exception information is logged.
* **Clarity and Consistency:** The code now follows a more consistent exception handling pattern, ensuring that all exceptions properly log the original exception if provided.

**How to use:**

```python
try:
    # ... your code that might raise a PrestaShopException ...
except PrestaShopException as e:
    print(e) # Print a nicely formatted error
    # ... handle the exception ...
```

This revised solution is more robust, informative, and aligns better with Pythonic exception handling practices.  It also fixes the previous issues in properly handling exceptions and providing useful debugging information. Remember to import `logger` from your `src.logger` module correctly. Also, make sure your `logger` object is properly configured for logging.
