**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly indicate the aspect being tested (e.g., `test_scenario_1_start`, `test_scenario_1_agent_creation`).

2. **Explicit Simulation Management:**  Crucially, the tests now start and end the simulation within each test function. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other and that the simulation state is reset for each test.  The `control.reset()` call is essential before each test.

3. **Assertions for `TinyPerson` Objects:** Checks if `agent` is an instance of `TinyPerson` to ensure correct object creation.

4. **Attribute Verification:** Verifies the values of `age` and `nationality` to ensure they are set correctly.

5. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed):**  The provided code doesn't appear to raise any exceptions that need to be tested with `pytest.raises`. I have removed unnecessary attempts to use `pytest.raises`.


6. **Complete Test Coverage (Conceptual):** The tests now cover the major aspects of the `test_scenario_1` function (start, agent creation/definition, listening/acting, and checkpointing).


**Important Considerations (and Next Steps):**

* **File Creation:** The `# TODO check file creation` comments are crucial. To test file creation, you need:
    * Modify your `tinytroupe.control` module to return the file path or handle of the created checkpoint file.
    * Add assertions to check if the file exists and if its content meets expectations.
    *  You need a way to assert that the files have been created, and that their contents contain the expected data.

* **Exception Handling (If Applicable):**  If your code handles any specific exceptions, add tests for those exceptions using `pytest.raises`.

* **Testing `control.reset()`:**  There should be tests to verify that `control.reset()` properly clears all relevant data and the internal state of the control module.

* **Mocking:**  For more complex interactions with external systems (e.g., file I/O, network calls), consider using mocking to isolate the tests and avoid relying on external resources.

* **Robust Fixtures:** If you have data that's frequently used in many tests, create fixtures to reuse it.


Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual tests for file handling and other checks in your `test_basic_scenarios.py`.  This significantly enhanced test suite is a solid starting point for further development.
