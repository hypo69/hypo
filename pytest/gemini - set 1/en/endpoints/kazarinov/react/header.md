```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests from the real file system and avoids accidental modifications to files.  `mock_sys_path` fixture to control `sys.path` for testing.
* **Mocking:** Uses `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock `open()` function for testing cases where the settings file might not exist or contain invalid JSON. This is crucial for isolating the `get_project_root` function and ensuring it doesn't raise exceptions unnecessarily.
* **Error Handling:** Added tests for the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` cases in the `get_project_root` function. These are crucial to ensure that the code gracefully handles potential issues.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_project_root_valid_input`).
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes tests for valid inputs, missing files, files in parent directories, and the scenario where a marker is not found.
* **Edge Cases:** Covers scenarios like an empty `settings.json` file.
* **pytest Features:** Uses `pytest.raises` and `tmp_path` for better testing and organization.
* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to fixtures and test functions, clearly explaining the purpose and expected behavior.
* **Correct Imports:** Corrected import statements to use `hypotez.src...`.

This improved solution provides much better coverage and more reliable tests for the `get_project_root` function, demonStarting the proper use of pytest fixtures and mocking for reliable testing. Remember to install the required packages (`pytest`, `pathlib`, `packaging`).


```bash
pip install pytest
```


To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
