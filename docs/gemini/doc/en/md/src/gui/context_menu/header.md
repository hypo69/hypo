# hypotez/src/gui/context_menu/header.py

## Overview

This module defines constants and paths related to the project's environment. It dynamically adjusts the system path to include necessary binary directories for libraries like GTK, FFmpeg, and Graphviz, ensuring proper operation.

## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string representing the development mode.

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Functions

### `__main__` (Not Documented)


## Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**:  Path to the root directory of the project.

**Type**: `pathlib.Path`

**Initialization**: Resolves the current working directory and navigates to the parent directory containing the project name.

### `gtk_bin_path`

**Description**: Path to the GTK binary directory.

**Type**: `pathlib.Path`

**Initialization**: Constructed from the project root path and the paths to the GTK binary directory.

### `ffmpeg_bin_path`

**Description**: Path to the FFmpeg binary directory.

**Type**: `pathlib.Path`

**Initialization**: Constructed from the project root path and the paths to the FFmpeg binary directory.

### `graphviz_bin_path`

**Description**: Path to the Graphviz binary directory.

**Type**: `pathlib.Path`

**Initialization**: Constructed from the project root path and the paths to the Graphviz binary directory.

### `paths_to_add`

**Description**: A list of paths to potentially add to the system path.

**Type**: `list`

**Content**: Contains the paths to the GTK, FFmpeg, and Graphviz binary directories.


### `current_paths`

**Description**: A set of paths already present in the system path.

**Type**: `set`

**Initialization**: Created from the current system paths.


## Imports

### `json`

**Description**: Provides functions for working with JSON data.

### `sys`

**Description**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.

### `pathlib`

**Description**: Provides objects for working with filesystem paths.

### `Path`

**Description**:  A class to represent file systems paths, allowing for easier navigation and manipulation.

### `warnings`

**Description**: Provides the ability to control warning messages that are generated by Python modules.


## Exception Handling (Not Documented)

## Miscellaneous

###  Loading Project Name from `settings.json`

**Description**: Reads the project name from `settings.json` to determine the root path for the project.


### Adding Paths to System Path

**Description**: Iterates through the `paths_to_add` list. For each path, it verifies if it's already in the `sys.path`. If not, the path is added to the beginning of `sys.path` to ensure the correct directory order.


### Setting `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES`

**Description**: Adds the GTK binary path to the `sys.path` if the `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES` environment variable is not present. This ensures that the required libraries for WeasyPrint are accessible.


### Suppressing GTK Warnings

**Description**:  Uses `warnings.filterwarnings` to suppress any GTK user warnings, preventing unwanted output to the console.
