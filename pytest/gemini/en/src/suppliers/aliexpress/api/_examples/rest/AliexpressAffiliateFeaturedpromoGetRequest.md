**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Added `example_domain` and `example_port` fixtures to provide data for the constructor.  This is best practice and makes the tests more readable and reusable.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive and indicate the scenario being tested.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover valid initialization, default domain, and potential invalid inputs for domain and port (and check if the exception handling works as expected). 
* **`pytest.raises`:** Used `pytest.raises` for testing exceptions, which is essential for robust exception handling.  The `str(excinfo.value)` part helps check *what* error message is raised.  Crucially, this is improved to test what error is raised.
* **Edge Cases:** The test for invalid inputs (domain and port) is now a more robust test of *how* the code deals with these scenarios; it checks that the exceptions are raised.
* **Comments:** Added comments explaining the purpose of each test.
* **Import Check:** Added a critical import check (commented out) to ensure the test file correctly references the classes/functions from the specified file location.  In a real project, you'd uncomment and modify this to use the appropriate path import.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_api.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_aliexpress_api.py
    ```

This improved test suite is more comprehensive and robust, verifying correct functionality and handling of potential errors in the `AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoGetRequest` class. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/..."` with the actual file path to your code if it's not in the current directory. Remember to adapt the test names to be more descriptive and specific to the actual behavior of your code.  Importantly, also check your code for potential `TypeError`'s, `ValueError`'s, and `AttributeError`'s (if any), etc. and test them individually.
