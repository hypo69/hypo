## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/fast_api/gemini.py`

This Python script, `gemini.py`, defines a FastAPI endpoint (`/ask`) that utilizes a Google Generative AI model (likely Gemini) to generate text responses.  It's part of the `hypotez` project's `fast_api` module.

### How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.  The script imports `flask` and `src.ai.google_generativeai.generative_ai`.  You'll need to have these dependencies installed, likely within a virtual environment.  Check `requirements.txt` for a complete list if one exists, or use pip to install required packages.

   - A Google Generative AI API key or credentials are likely needed for the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class to function correctly.  These credentials should be managed securely (outside the code itself).

2. **Running the Application:**

   - Execute the script: `python gemini.py`
   - This will start a development server.  The server will be listening for HTTP requests on a default port (usually 5000).


3. **Sending a Request (POST):**

   - **Endpoint:** `/ask`
   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **Request Body:** The request body should be a JSON object with a single field:

     ```json
     {
       "prompt": "Your question or text input"
     }
     ```

     * **Crucial:**  The `prompt` field is *mandatory*.  Sending a request without it will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

   - **Example Request (using `curl`):**

     ```bash
     curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"prompt": "Tell me a joke."}' \
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask
     ```


4. **Interpreting the Response:**

   - **Successful Response (200 OK):**  The server responds with a JSON object containing a `reply` field:
     ```json
     {
       "reply": "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
     }
     ```
   - **Error Response (400-500):**  If there's an error, the server returns a JSON object containing an `error` field, along with an appropriate HTTP status code to indicate the nature of the problem.  For example:
     ```json
     {"error": "No prompt provided"}  // 400 Bad Request
     {"error": "Invalid prompt format"} // 400 Bad Request
     {"error": "Error connecting to the Google API"}  // 500 Internal Server Error
     ```

### Important Considerations

- **Error Handling:** The code includes a `try...except` block to catch exceptions that may occur during the API call.  Critically, this ensures the server doesn't crash due to problems with the Generative AI service.
- **Security:**  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys directly in the code.  Instead, use environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism.
- **Debugging:** Run the script in a debugging environment (e.g., with a debugger) to diagnose problems.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of any rate limits imposed by the Google Generative AI API.


### Further Development

- **Input Validation:** Implement more robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
- **More detailed error reporting:** Provide more specific error messages to help with debugging.
- **Input sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (if applicable).
- **Input length limitations:** Consider implementing input length limits for the prompt to avoid potential issues with the API.
- **Logging:** Add logging to track requests, responses, and any errors.
- **Documentation:**  A dedicated API documentation file (e.g., using `fastapi`'s built-in functionalities) would make the usage more accessible to developers.
