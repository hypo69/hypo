# Changes Made

*   Added missing import for `logging` and `j_loads`.
*   Corrected the file name to `prepare_all_campaigns.py` from `prepare_all_camapaigns.py`.
*   Added a `prepare_all_campaigns` function that calls `process_all_campaigns`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads`.
*   Added a comprehensive docstring for the module and the `prepare_all_campaigns` function following RST conventions.
*   Implemented error handling using `logger.error` with `exc_info=True` to capture detailed error information.
*   Added a basic `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for example usage (optional).
*   Corrected the shebang line to use `#! /usr/bin/env python3` which is a standard and portable way to specify the Python interpreter.
*   Removed unused `MODE` variable.
*   Improved the description of the module's purpose.
