**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the scenario being tested.
* **Mocking:** Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock file operations for more reliable and isolated tests. This is crucial for testing `get_project_root`.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests for cases where the marker file is in a parent directory, for a deep parent directory, and when no marker files are found.
* **Exception Handling:** Includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, verifying the code's robustness in handling potential issues.
* **Custom Marker Files:**  Tests support for a custom tuple of marker files.
* **Robustness:** The tests now cover more possible scenarios, increasing confidence in the code's correctness.
* **Fixtures:** Uses `@pytest.fixture` to create mock files for better organization and readability.
* **tmp_path:** Uses `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary directories to avoid conflicts between tests.
* **sys.path:** Mocks `sys.path` to prevent unintended modifications to the test environment.

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage, making it easier to maintain and debug the code. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```

Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with the actual project name if it's different.  Also, adjust the paths within the `test_settings_loading_file_not_found` and `test_get_project_root_non_existent_file` if they need to reference a different directory structure.
