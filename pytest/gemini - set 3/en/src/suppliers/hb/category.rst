```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `Driver` and `Supplier` objects using `unittest.mock`. This is crucial for isolating the tests from the actual website interaction.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test cases are now more descriptive and focused on specific scenarios (valid input, no products, pagination).

3. **Edge Cases:** Added a test (`test_get_list_products_in_category_no_products`) to handle the case where there are no products on the category page.  This is a crucial edge case.

4. **Error Handling:** The `logger.warning` is mocked so that the test doesn't raise an exception if there is no product.

5. **Mock Data:** Mock data is now provided to test different situations (no products, pagination).

6. **Assert Statements:** Assertions are added to verify the expected behavior of the functions based on the mock data. This is crucial to confirm if the function returns the correct values or None or empty lists.

7. **Complete Test Coverage:** Tests cover a wider range of possible inputs (valid input, empty list, pagination).

8. **Robust Pagination Test:**  The `test_get_list_products_in_category_pagination` now accounts for the scenario where products from multiple pages need to be extracted.

9. **Paginator Test:** A test is added to check the `paginator` function when it doesn't find the next page, avoiding potential errors.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install pytest:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Place the mock classes (`Driver`, `Supplier`) and `logger` in the correct location where the original code is located or adjust import paths accordingly.
3. Run pytest from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


Remember to replace the placeholder `...` in the original code with actual implementations. The tests will fail if these placeholders are not replaced.  These tests are more meaningful and helpful. This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous response, providing a more robust and thorough set of test cases.
