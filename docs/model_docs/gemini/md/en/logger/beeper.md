## Overview

This module provides a configurable beeping system for logging events. It allows defining different sounds for various log levels, including success, info, attention, warning, debug, error, long_error, critical, and bell.  The module supports both synchronous and asynchronous beep generation.

## Classes

### `BeepLevel`

**Description**: An enumeration representing different levels of events, each associated with a specific melody.

**Members**:
- `SUCCESS`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the success sound.
- `INFO`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the info sound.
- `INFO_LONG`:  A tuple for a longer INFO sound.
- `ATTENTION`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the attention sound.
- `WARNING`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the warning sound.
- `DEBUG`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the debug sound.
- `ERROR`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the error sound.
- `LONG_ERROR`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for a longer error sound.
- `CRITICAL`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the critical sound.
- `BELL`: A tuple of note and duration pairs for the bell sound.


### `BeepHandler`

**Description**: A class for handling the emission of beeps based on log records.

**Methods**:
- `emit(self, record)`: Processes a log record and plays a corresponding sound based on the `level` attribute.

### `Beeper`

**Description**: A class for generating beeps, managing silent mode, and handling different beep types.

**Attributes**:
- `silent`: A boolean flag indicating whether the beeping is currently suppressed. Defaults to `False`.

**Methods**:
- `beep(self, level: BeepLevel | str = BeepLevel.INFO, frequency: int = 400, duration: int = 1000) -> None`: Plays a beep sound corresponding to the given level and parameters.  Handles both string and `BeepLevel` input for `level`.  Includes detailed error handling within the function. This function is decorated with `@silent_mode`.


## Functions

### `silent_mode`

**Description**: A decorator function to manage the silent mode.

**Parameters**:
- `func`: The function to be decorated.

**Returns**:
- The decorated function. The decorated function checks the `Beeper.silent` attribute and either calls the original function or skips the beep if silent mode is active. This function is used as a decorator.
