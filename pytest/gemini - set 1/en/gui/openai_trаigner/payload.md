```python
import pytest

# No actual code provided in the prompt to test.  
#  The file payload.py has no functions/classes, only a constant.

# Placeholder tests, assuming a hypothetical function in payload.py
# Replace with actual test cases based on the actual code.

def test_mode_is_development():
    """Verify that the MODE constant is 'development'."""
    from hypotez.src.gui.openai_trаigner.payload import MODE
    assert MODE == 'development', f"Expected 'development', but got '{MODE}'"


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **No Code to Test:** The provided Python code (`payload.py`) is essentially empty (except for comments and a constant).  There's nothing to test.  I've provided placeholder tests assuming there was a function or class defined, which would need to be replaced by tests based on the actual code.

2. **Clear Test Function Names:** The test function names (`test_mode_is_development`) clearly describe the purpose of each test.

3. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is independent and does not rely on the state of other tests.

4. **Valid Input:** The `test_mode_is_development` test verifies the expected value of the constant.

5. **Edge Cases/Invalid Inputs (Placeholder):**  Without the actual code, edge cases are impossible to define.  If there were functions or parameters with limitations, you'd need to create tests for those.

6. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  Similarly, if functions in the payload.py file were designed to raise exceptions in specific scenarios, `pytest.raises` would be needed.

7. **Fixtures:** No fixtures are necessary in this case, since there's no external data needed to run the tests.


**How to use these tests (assuming a real `payload.py`):**

1. **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_payload.py`).
2. **Run:** Run `pytest test_payload.py` in your terminal.

**Crucial Next Step:**  Replace the placeholder comments and tests with your actual test cases based on the *real* contents of `hypotez/src/gui/openai_trаigner/payload.py`.  This example shows the structure and approach, but it needs to be adapted to cover the specific functionality of the code you want to test.  Without the real code, I cannot write meaningful test cases.
