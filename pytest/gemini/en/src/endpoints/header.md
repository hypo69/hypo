```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

2. **Dummy File Creation:** Uses `Path.touch()` to create temporary test files for `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, and handles cleanup.  This prevents tests from relying on pre-existing files.

3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`, `test_set_project_root_marker_file_not_found`, to cover cases where no marker files are found, and where marker files don't exist in the expected path.

4. **Error Handling:** `test_set_project_root_marker_file_not_found` is now more robust to handle the case where the provided marker file doesn't exist.

5. **Fixture for Settings:** Introduced a `settings_json_file` fixture to manage a temporary `settings.json` file, making tests cleaner and more isolated.  The `test_settings_loading` now correctly utilizes the fixture.

6. **Realistic Error Testing:**  The `test_settings_not_found` test now demonstrates handling cases where the `settings.json` file does not exist.

7. **Import correction:** imports are adjusted for `set_project_root`


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs` Module:** The code uses the `gs` module, which is not included in the provided code snippet.  You'll need to add `from src import gs` to your test file to make the tests pass.


* **Cleanup:** The code now includes cleanup steps (removing dummy files) to prevent test interference.


* **Robustness:** These tests are more comprehensive and robust, covering various scenarios like the marker files not being present. You may need to adjust further if needed to validate the function based on the specifics of `gs` and the file handling in the actual code.


This significantly improved solution demonstrates a more complete and practical approach to testing, covering essential edge cases and handling potential exceptions. Remember to adapt the `assert` statements to validate the correct behavior based on the output of `set_project_root` and other functions. Remember to add tests for any additional functions from `src` (e.g., the file reading functions) that may depend on `set_project_root`'s output.
