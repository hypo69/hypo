"prompt": "You must document code in the following style. All comments in the code, including module, class, and function descriptions, should be written in reStructuredText (RST) format. For each module, class, and function, follow this template:\n\n1. **Module**:\n    - The module description should be written in the header, indicating its purpose.\n    - Provide examples of using the module, if possible. Code examples should be enclosed in a `.. code-block:: python` block.\n    - Specify the platforms and synopsis of the module.\n    - Use headers for attributes and methods of the module where necessary.\n\nExample of module documentation:\n```\nModule for working with a programming assistant\n=========================================================================================\n\nThis module contains the :class:`CodeAssistant` class, which is used to interact with various AI models, \nsuch as Google Gemini and OpenAI, for code processing tasks.\n\nExample usage\n--------------------\n\nExample of using the `CodeAssistant` class:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    assistant = CodeAssistant(role=\'code_checker\', lang=\'ru\', model=[\'gemini\'])\n    assistant.process_files()\n```\n\n2. **Classes**:\n    - Each class should be described according to its purpose. Include the class description, its attributes, and methods.\n    - In the class section, list all methods, their purpose, and examples of usage.\n    - For each method, include descriptions of its parameters and return values, as well as examples.\n\nExample of class documentation:\n```\nClass for working with the programming assistant\n=========================================================================================\n\nThe :class:`CodeAssistant` class is used to interact with various AI models such as Google Gemini, \nand provides methods for analyzing and generating documentation for code.\n\nAttributes:\n----------\n- `role`: The role of the assistant (e.g., \'code_checker\').\n- `lang`: The language the assistant will use (e.g., \'ru\').\n- `model`: List of AI models used (e.g., [\'gemini\']).\n\nMethods:\n--------\n- `process_files`: Method for processing code files.\n\nExample usage:\n---------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    assistant = CodeAssistant(role=\'code_checker\', lang=\'ru\', model=[\'gemini\'])\n    assistant.process_files()\n```\n\n3. **Functions and Methods**:\n    - Document each function or method by specifying parameters and return values.\n    - For each function, provide a description of its purpose and usage examples in the `.. code-block:: python` format.\n\nExample of method documentation:\n```\nMethod for processing files\n=========================================================================================\n\nThis method is used to analyze and process code files.\n\nParameters:\n-----------\n- `files`: A list of files to process.\n- `options`: Additional parameters for configuring the processing.\n\nReturn value:\n----------------------\n- Returns the processing result as a list of analyzed data.\n\nExample usage:\n---------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    assistant = CodeAssistant(role=\'code_checker\', lang=\'ru\', model=[\'gemini\'])\n    result = assistant.process_files(files=[\'file1.py\', \'file2.py\'], options={})\n```\n\n4. **Code Comments**:\n    - All comments in the code should be written in RST format and should explain what the specific part of the code does.\n    - Leave comments in blocks, not in lines. Use comments to describe the logic and explain decisions or temporary solutions in the code.\n    - Example:\n    ```\n    # Here, the exception is being handled to continue execution if the file is not found\n    try:\n        process_file(file)\n    except FileNotFoundError as ex:\n        handle_exception(ex)\n    ```\n\n5. **Exceptions**:\n    - Document exceptions for classes, methods, and functions.\n    - Specify which exceptions can be raised and under what circumstances.\n\nExample of exception documentation:\n```\nFile Not Found Exception\n=========================================================================================\n\nThis exception is raised when a file is not found during processing.\n\nParameters:\n-----------\n- `file`: The path of the file that was not found.\n\nExample usage:\n---------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    try:\n        open(file)\n    except FileNotFoundError as ex:\n        raise FileNotFoundError("File not found") from ex\n```\n\nFollow these instructions for documenting your code. All comments should be clear, informative, and compliant with the RST standard."\n```

2. <algorithm>

This prompt defines a set of guidelines for creating RST-style documentation.  No code is provided to analyze or create a step-by-step diagram for. There is no algorithm or workflow to describe.

3. <explanation>

The provided text is a prompt, not code.  It instructs a user (presumably a developer) on how to document Python code using reStructuredText (RST) format.  It outlines the structure and style of documentation for modules, classes, functions, and methods, providing examples.  This prompt is intended as a guide to create readable and consistent documentation within a project.

* **Imports:**  There are no imports in the prompt.
* **Classes:** The prompt defines the structure for documenting classes (e.g., `CodeAssistant`), detailing expected attributes (e.g., `role`, `lang`, `model`) and methods (e.g., `process_files`).
* **Functions/Methods:** The prompt similarly details the expected structure for documenting functions and methods (e.g., parameters, return values, examples) within RST format.
* **Variables:**  The prompt implicitly suggests variables as part of methods and functions, however, it does not provide specific variable details.
* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**  There are no errors to identify, and the prompt's instructions are generally sound for improving code documentation.


**Chain of Relationships (within the context of code):**

The prompt is a part of a larger project or process involving writing documentation.  It would be used by a developer to guide the writing of code comments and documentation strings within code files, thereby linking to the source code itself.
