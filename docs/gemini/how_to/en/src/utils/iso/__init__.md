# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py`, appears to be an initialization file for a module related to ISO standards or specifications within the `hypotez` project.  It doesn't contain any functions or classes, but rather defines a global variable.

**Purpose:**

The file likely serves as a starting point for the `utils/iso` module.  It's crucial for importing the module and using its functions (which will likely be defined in other files within the `utils/iso` directory).

**Key Element:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This line defines a global variable named `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'. This suggests the module might have different operational modes (e.g., 'dev', 'prod'), potentially affecting its behavior or output.

**How to use (or rather, how to _import_ and *eventually* use):**

1. **Import the module:**  You can't directly use the `MODE` variable from this file.  Instead, you import the `utils.iso` module in your other Python scripts.

```python
import hypotez.src.utils.iso as iso_utils

# Access the mode
mode = iso_utils.MODE
print(mode)  # Output: dev
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Functionality:** The current file only defines a global variable.  Functions or classes related to ISO standards or specifications would likely be implemented in other files within the `utils/iso` directory.
* **Further Development:** The documentation suggests the developer intends to create functions related to ISO standards but the implementation details are missing in this file.  Subsequent files in the `utils/iso` directory will likely define functions and classes implementing that functionality.
* **Context:** To fully understand the intended usage, you would need to examine other files within the `utils/iso` directory.


**Example Implementation (Hypothetical):**

```python
# hypotez/src/utils/iso/iso_codes.py

def get_country_code(iso_code):
    """Retrieves country code based on the provided ISO code."""
    if MODE == 'dev':
        # Dev logic to fetch data
        return ISO_CODES.get(iso_code, "Unknown")
    elif MODE == 'prod':
        # Prod logic to fetch data from a database or external API.
        return get_country_code_prod(iso_code)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown mode {MODE}")


# ... (Rest of the code implementing data fetching/processing)
```

This hypothetical example demonstrates how a separate file (`iso_codes.py`) might implement functions based on the `MODE` variable.  The `ISO_CODES` dictionary would hold the ISO country codes.  Importantly, the example illustrates a situation where mode-specific code can be defined in different `utils/iso` submodules to handle different aspects of the ISO implementation.


In summary, this `__init__.py` is a placeholder file; actual ISO-related functionality will be in other files within the `utils/iso` directory.  To use it, you must import the module and subsequently use the functions/classes defined in those other files.
