## 1. Creating a Campaign

This section details the steps for initializing a new campaign.

**1.1. Initializing the Campaign:**

* Provide the campaign name, language, and currency.
* **Example:**
```python

campaign_config = {'name': campaign_name, 'language': language, 'currency': currency}
save_config(campaign_name, campaign_config)
```

**1.4. Collecting Product Data:**

* **Example:**
```python
product_urls = ['https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123.html', 'https://www.aliexpress.com/item/456.html']
product_data = collect_product_data(product_urls)
```

**1.5. Saving Product Data:**

* Save the collected product data.
* **Example:**
```python
save_product_data(campaign_name, product_data)
```

**1.6. Creating Promotional Materials:**

* Generate promotional materials based on the gathered product data.
* **Example:**
```python
create_promotional_materials(campaign_name, product_data)
```

**1.7. Reviewing and Publishing the Campaign:**

* Review the campaign's setup and publish it.
* **Example:**
```python
review_campaign(campaign_name)
publish_campaign(campaign_name)
```

## 2. Editing an Existing Campaign

This section details the steps for updating an existing campaign.

**2.1. Loading Existing Campaign Configuration:**

* Load the configuration of the existing campaign.
* **Example:**
```python
campaign_name = 'example_campaign'
campaign_config = load_config(campaign_name)
```

**2.2. Updating Campaign Configuration:**

* Modify campaign parameters such as language and currency.
* **Example:**
```python
campaign_config['language'] = 'RU'
save_config(campaign_name, campaign_config)
```

**2.3. Updating Categories and Directories:**

* Update the list of categories and their associated directories.
* **Example:**
```python
new_categories = ['home', 'beauty']
update_categories(campaign_name, new_categories)
```

**2.4. Collecting Updated Product Data:**

* Input new product URLs or IDs for the updated campaign.
* **Example:**
```python
new_product_urls = ['https://www.aliexpress.com/item/789.html']
updated_product_data = collect_product_data(new_product_urls)
```

**2.5. Saving Updated Product Data:**

* Save the newly collected product data.
* **Example:**
```python
save_product_data(campaign_name, updated_product_data)
```

**2.6. Updating Promotional Materials:**

## 3. Error Handling and Logging

Implement robust error handling and logging for production reliability.

**3.1. Error Handling:**

* Use `try-except` blocks to catch and log exceptions.
* **Example:**
```python
try:
    # Your code
except Exception as ex:
    logger.error("Error occurred", ex)
```

**3.2. Logging Events:**

* Log important events and errors for debugging.
