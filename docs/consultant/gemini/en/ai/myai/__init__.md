```

**Changes Made**:

- Added a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format to describe the purpose of the module.
- Removed extraneous comments about "AI Suppliers."  The module-level docstring already gives context.  Redundant comments are generally not helpful.
- Improved formatting: added blank lines for better readability.

**Explanation of Changes**:

The original code had some redundant and slightly disorganized comments.  The improvements focused on enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the code by using appropriate RST documentation and removing unnecessary comments. The revised docstring is more informative and directly addresses the module's role without relying on separate comments.
