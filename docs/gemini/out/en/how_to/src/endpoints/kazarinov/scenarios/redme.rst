How to use the product processing workflow
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block, represented as a sequence diagram, describes the workflow for processing product data using an AI model.  It outlines the interaction between a user, an AI model, and a logger, handling potential errors and different data structures.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Request Initiation:** The user initiates the request by providing a `products_list` to the AI model.

2. **Model Processing:** The AI model processes the request using its internal processing logic.

3. **Model Response:** The AI model sends a response back to the user.

4. **Error Handling (No Response):** If no response is received from the AI model, an error ("no response from gemini") is logged, and a retry is initiated with reduced attempts.

5. **Error Handling (Invalid Data):** If the received data is not valid, an error ("Error in data from gemini") is logged, and a retry is initiated.

6. **Data Processing (List Format):**
    a. **List Structure Check:** If the response is a list, the code checks the structure of the data.

    b. **Two Elements (ru, he):** If the list has two elements (assumed to represent `ru` and `he` data), the user extracts these elements.

    c. **Single Element:** If the list contains a single element, the user extracts `ru` and `he` from the first element of the list.

    d. **Invalid Data Structure:** If the list structure is invalid, an error ("Problem parsing the response") is logged and a retry initiated.

7. **Data Processing (Object Format):** If the response is an object, the user extracts the `ru` and `he` values.

8. **Error Handling (Invalid Values):** If the extracted `ru` or `he` values are invalid, an error ("Invalid ru or he data") is logged, and a retry is initiated.

9. **Result Return:** If all steps are successful, the user retrieves the `ru` and `he` data and returns the result.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (Example Python code to initiate the request and handle the response)
    #  This is a *conceptual* example; actual code would depend on how the AI model and data are accessed.
    import requests

    def process_products(products_list):
        try:
            response = requests.post('/ai/model/process', json=products_list)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)

            data = response.json()
            if isinstance(data, list):
                # check list length
                if len(data) == 2 :
                    ru = data[0]
                    he = data[1]
                else:
                    # Extract ru, he from first element
                    ru = data[0]['ru']
                    he = data[0]['he']


            elif isinstance(data, dict):
                 ru = data['ru']
                 he = data['he']

            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid response format")

            return ru, he

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Network error: {e}")
            return None, None
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Data error: {e}")
            return None, None
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            return None, None

    # Example usage
    product_list = [{"name": "Product 1"}, {"name": "Product 2"}]
    ru_result, he_result = process_products(product_list)
    if ru_result and he_result:
        print(f"ru data: {ru_result}, he data: {he_result}")
    else:
        print("Processing failed.")
