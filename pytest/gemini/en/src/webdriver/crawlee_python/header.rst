**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mocking:**  Crucially, fixtures `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` are introduced. These create temporary files containing mock data, allowing you to test the code without needing actual `settings.json` and `README.MD` files in your project.
* **`tmp_path` fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used in `test_set_project_root_marker_file_exists_in_parent_dir` to create a temporary directory structure to test the scenario of the marker files existing in a parent directory. This avoids cluttering the file system.
* **Mocking `gs.path`:** The code now correctly mocks `gs.path.root` using a `MockGsPath` class.  This isolates the `header` module's functionality from the potential implementation details of `gs.path`.
* **Error Handling:** The tests now include comprehensive error handling. `pytest.raises` is used to assert that `FileNotFoundError` is raised when the files don't exist.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_settings_loading_success`).
* **`teardown_module`:** A `teardown_module` function is added to clean up the temporary mock files created during the tests. This prevents file system pollution.
* **Improved `test_set_project_root_marker_files_not_found`:** This test case is improved to include a correct assertion to confirm that the root path returned is indeed the current working directory when no marker files are found.
* **`project_root_mock` Fixture for Testing the Function:** A `project_root_mock` fixture is added to provide the `tmp_path` for testing the `set_project_root` function, allowing for more controlled testing scenarios.
* **Complete `test_settings_loading_success` and `test_doc_loading_success`:**  These tests are more complete; they use the `project_root_mock` and correctly check for the expected behavior.

This revised solution is significantly more robust and addresses the shortcomings of the previous response. Remember to replace `"your_project_dir"` with the actual path to your project directory if you need to use it in the tests.  Also, make sure that `gs` is defined and available in the `header.py` file's scope for the tests to work.
