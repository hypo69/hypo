# CampaignEditor Module Documentation

## Overview

This module provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing AliExpress campaigns.  It allows users to open JSON files containing campaign data, display and modify the data in the GUI, and prepare the campaign for use.


## Classes

### `CampaignEditor`

**Description**:  A PyQt6-based widget for editing campaign data.  It handles file loading, data display, and campaign preparation.

**Attributes**:

- `data (SimpleNamespace)`:  The loaded campaign data.
- `current_campaign_file (str)`: Path to the currently loaded campaign JSON file.
- `editor (AliCampaignEditor)`: An instance of the `AliCampaignEditor` class, responsible for the campaign preparation logic.


**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, parent=None, main_app=None)`

**Description**: Initializes the `CampaignEditor` widget.

**Parameters**:
- `parent (optional)`: The parent widget (defaults to `None`).
- `main_app (optional)`: The main application instance (defaults to `None`).  This reference is likely used for inter-widget communication.

**Raises**:
- No explicit exceptions raised in the docstring.

#### `setup_ui(self)`

**Description**: Sets up the user interface elements.  This includes creating widgets for file selection, campaign title/description/promotion name input and buttons to open files and prepare campaigns.

**Raises**:
- No explicit exceptions raised in the docstring.

#### `setup_connections(self)`

**Description**: Establishes signal-slot connections for GUI events.  (No specific connections are defined in the code.)

**Raises**:
- No explicit exceptions raised in the docstring.


#### `open_file(self)`

**Description**: Opens a file dialog to select a JSON campaign file.

**Parameters**:
- None.

**Raises**:
- No explicit exceptions raised in the docstring.

#### `load_file(self, campaign_file)`

**Description**: Loads the specified JSON campaign file and populates the GUI.

**Parameters**:
- `campaign_file (str)`: The path to the JSON campaign file.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`:  Raises an exception if the JSON file cannot be loaded or parsed.  More specific error message is included in the `QtWidgets.QMessageBox`.

#### `create_widgets(self, data)`

**Description**: Creates the GUI widgets to display and edit campaign data.

**Parameters**:
- `data (SimpleNamespace)`: The campaign data to display.

**Raises**:
- No explicit exceptions raised in the docstring.

#### `prepare_campaign(self)`

**Description**: Asynchronously prepares the campaign using the `AliCampaignEditor` instance.

**Parameters**:
- None

**Raises**:
- `Exception`:  Raises an exception if the campaign preparation fails.  More specific error message is included in the `QtWidgets.QMessageBox`.


## Functions (None)

## Notes

- The code uses `QEventLoop` and `asyncSlot` from `qasync`. This suggests an asynchronous programming pattern for potentially long-running operations.
-  `AliCampaignEditor` is imported but not fully documented here.  A separate document for it would be needed.
- Error handling using `QtWidgets.QMessageBox` is utilized, which shows the user feedback messages.
