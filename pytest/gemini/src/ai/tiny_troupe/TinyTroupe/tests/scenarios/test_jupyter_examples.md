**Explanation of Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `test_notebook_execution` now includes a `try...except` block to catch exceptions during notebook execution. It prints the exception and uses `pytest.fail` to mark the test as failing, providing more informative error messages.  Critically, it now properly handles the case where a notebook raises an exception.
* **Temporary Directory:** A `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` is used to create a temporary directory to save the executed notebook. This prevents issues with saving files in a directory and making sure the files are deleted after the test. This is **crucial** for keeping tests isolated and preventing unintended modifications to the notebook files.
* **Robustness Check:** The code now checks if the `notebook_path` actually exists before proceeding, preventing the test from failing due to a missing notebook file.  There is better error handling for invalid paths.
* **`get_notebooks` testing:** Added tests to validate the `get_notebooks` function for empty folders and folders without `.ipynb` files. These tests are critical for ensuring the function itself works as expected.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Ensure your paths are correct:** Update the `NOTEBOOK_FOLDER` variable with the correct path to your examples folder.  Also fix any paths within the `sys.path.insert` functions.
2.  **Save:** Save the code as `test_jupyter_examples.py` (or an appropriate name) in the `tests/scenarios` directory in your project.
3.  **Run pytest:** Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run `pytest tests/scenarios/test_jupyter_examples.py`.

This revised solution addresses several critical issues with the original attempt, ensuring more robust and reliable testing of the notebook execution.  It includes better error handling, better organization, and improved testing of the auxiliary function (`get_notebooks`). Remember to replace the placeholder paths with the actual paths in your project. Remember to install `nbformat` and `nbconvert` if you haven't already:


```bash
pip install nbformat nbconvert
```
