```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mock Files:** Added `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures. These create temporary files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`) within a test directory, allowing tests to load them without impacting the actual files.  Crucially, they clean up the temporary files.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_in_subdir`).
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Using `tmp_path` from `pytest` to create temporary directories for testing file system interactions, which is now essential for proper isolation.  The solution should be designed with this fixture in mind.
* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Added tests for various scenarios, including:
    * Valid inputs (different root locations)
    * Cases where marker files are not found.
    * No marker files provided.
    * Invalid marker file names.
    * Handling the `settings.json` file's existence and potential errors during loading.
    * Handling the `README.MD` file's existence and potential errors during loading.
    * Correct file paths.
* **Exception Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` for the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` cases in the loading of `settings.json` and `README.md`.
* **System Path Test:** Verify that the correct path is added to `sys.path`.
* **Missing src Directory:** Created a `src` directory within the `tmp_path` to ensure `set_project_root` is called correctly in other cases.

This revised solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for the `set_project_root` function, especially with respect to file existence and handling errors. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`


**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as `test_logger.py` (or a similar name).
2.  Place the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` in the same directory.
3.  Run `pytest test_logger.py` from your terminal.


This will execute the test cases, providing detailed output on their success or failure.  Note that it critically relies on proper fixture usage to manage temporary files. Also, remember that the imports in the actual code need to be correctly configured.
