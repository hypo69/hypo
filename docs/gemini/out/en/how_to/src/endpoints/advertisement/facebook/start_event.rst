How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a script for sending events to Facebook groups. It uses the FacebookPromoter class to automate the process.  The script continuously runs, posting events to various Facebook groups based on specified JSON files containing group details and event names.  The code incorporates error handling for interruptions.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes a WebDriver instance (likely Chrome) and navigates to the Facebook website.  It defines a list of JSON file paths (`filenames`) containing information about Facebook groups to target and a list of event names (`events_names`).

2. **Object Creation**: It instantiates a `FacebookPromoter` object, passing the WebDriver instance and the file paths as arguments.  A boolean flag (`no_video=True`) suggests the script will not use videos in its event posts.

3. **Looping and Event Posting**: The code enters a `while True` loop, which signifies a continuous execution mode.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It logs the current time to the debug log.
     - It calls `promoter.run_events()`, which is responsible for actually posting the events to the defined Facebook groups using the event data from the JSON files.
     - It logs the time the script will sleep.
     - It pauses the execution for 7200 seconds (2 hours) using `time.sleep()`.

4. **Error Handling**: A `try...except` block handles `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions. If the script is interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), it logs a message indicating the campaign was interrupted.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have the necessary libraries installed
    import time
    # ... (import other necessary modules from the code)
    
    # ... (replace with actual file paths)
    filenames = ["your_managed_groups.json", "usa.json", ...]
    events_names = ["your_event_name"]
    
    # ... (initialize Driver as defined in the code)
    
    promoter = FacebookPromoter(d, group_file_paths=filenames, no_video=True)

    try:
        while True:
          logger.debug(f"waikig up {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}",None,False)
          promoter.run_events(events_names=events_names, group_file_paths=filenames)
          logger.debug(f"going to sleep at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}",None,False)
          time.sleep(7200)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Campaign promotion interrupted.")


**Explanation of Key Variables**

* `filenames`: List of JSON file paths containing details about the Facebook groups.
* `events_names`: A list of event names to post to the groups.
* `no_video`: A flag specifying whether to exclude video from event posts.


**Important Considerations**

* **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for issues with file reading, Facebook API limitations, network problems, and any other potential errors.
* **Authentication**: Ensure the code handles Facebook API authentication securely.
* **Rate Limiting**: The Facebook API has rate limits. The script should respect these limits to avoid getting blocked.
* **Security**: Use secure methods for storing credentials and sensitive information. Do not hardcode sensitive information directly into your code.
* **Maintainability**: Break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions for easier maintenance and understanding.
