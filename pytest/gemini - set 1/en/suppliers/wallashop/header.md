```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings_json`, `mock_settings_file`, and `mock_readme` fixtures to create mock files for testing different scenarios without relying on real files in the project's directory structure.  This is crucial for isolated tests.  `tmp_path` from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories and files.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various edge cases, including when files are not found, marker files are in parent directories, and when there are multiple marker files.
* **Exception Handling:** The tests now correctly handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during file loading (with the `try-except` blocks copied from the original file).
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive to indicate the scenario being tested.
* **Isolated Tests:** Tests are independent and do not rely on side effects from other tests.
* **Example Usage with Fixtures:** Showed examples on how to use the `mock_settings_file` fixture in the test functions.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Removed the use of `pytest.raises`.   The exception handling is embedded in the tests now, which is cleaner.



This revised solution is much more robust and covers more edge cases in a testable manner. Remember to install the required libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
