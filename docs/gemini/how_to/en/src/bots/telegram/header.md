How to use the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` file

This file, `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`, defines the root path of the project and initializes some project-related variables.  It's crucial for organizing imports and accessing project-specific files and configurations.

**Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root(marker_files=...)`:**  This function is the core of the file. It determines the absolute path to the project root directory.

   - It starts from the directory containing the current Python script (`__file__`).
   - It searches up the directory tree for directories containing any of the specified marker files (defaults to `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
   - It stops at the first directory where a marker file is found.
   - If found, it adds the project root path to `sys.path`, making modules importable from subdirectories.  This is vital for modular projects.
   - Importantly, it returns the root path as a `Path` object, which is more robust than a string path, and returns the current directory as a fallback if no matching directory is found.

2. **Initialization of Project Metadata:**

   - It retrieves project settings from a JSON file (`src/settings.json`).  This file likely holds critical information like the project name, version, author, and other metadata.
   - It retrieves the project's documentation from `src/README.MD`.
   - If `settings.json` or `README.MD` is missing, or invalid JSON, it gracefully handles the errors.
   - It defines variables like `__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__` to store this information.  Using `__`-prefixed variables is a standard Python convention for internal variables.  The values are defaulted to sensible options in case of errors.

**How to Use:**

1. **Place the file:** Save this file in the `hypotez/src/logger` directory of your project.


2. **Import the file:**  In other modules within your `hypotez` project, you can import the variables and functions defined in `header.py` as follows:

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.logger.header import __root__, __project_name__, __version__
   ```

3. **Accessing Paths:**

    - Use the `__root__` variable to obtain the project root path.

   ```python
   file_path = __root__ / "data" / "my_file.txt"
   ```


**Crucial Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` if the configuration files are missing or invalid. This is a good practice for production code.

* **`sys.path` Modification:**  Adding the project root to `sys.path` allows you to import modules from subdirectories without needing absolute paths. This is a very important part of the project's structure.

* **`Path` Object:** Using `pathlib.Path` for file paths is preferable to string manipulation, as it offers better handling of operating system specifics.

* **`marker_files`:** Be mindful of the choices you make for the `marker_files` tuple.  These files act as cues for your project's boundary. Ensure that these files are present (or that a suitable fallback is in place if they are not).

* **`settings.json`:**  Make sure you have a valid `settings.json` file in the `src` directory containing the necessary configuration values, and that the content is correctly formatted.
