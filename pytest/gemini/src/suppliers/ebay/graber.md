**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to create a mock `Driver` object.  This isolates the tests from the actual webdriver interaction, which is crucial for reliable testing.  The `@pytest.fixture`  correctly creates and returns the mock driver for use within the tests.

2. **Graber Instance Creation:** A `@pytest.fixture` named `graber` is created.  This is a great way to prepare the `Graber` object in a consistent way for each test method.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more specific (e.g., `test_graber_init`).

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Added `test_graber_set_locator_for_decorator` and `test_graber_no_locator_for_decorator` which cover the `Context.locator_for_decorator` aspect.

5. **Error Handling (Placeholder):**  The `test_close_popup_decorator_exception` is a placeholder.  You *must* replace the placeholder with the actual function call, mocked exception, and assertion if you intend to test that part.

6. **Missing `ExecuteLocatorException`:** The code imports `from src.logger import logger`.  If there is a custom exception called `ExecuteLocatorException` (which is implied by the code comments), you need to add it to the imports:
```python
from src.webdriver.exceptions import ExecuteLocatorException
```
   and add correct `with pytest.raises(ExecuteLocatorException)` statements.


**How to proceed with testing the `close_pop_up` decorator:**

* **Implement the decorator correctly:**  Uncomment the decorator code in the `graber.py` file and make sure the `Context.locator_for_decorator` is appropriately used.
* **Mock the relevant parts:** Mock `Context.driver.execute_locator` and `await` in your decorator test functions.
* **Define the exception type:** Import `ExecuteLocatorException` if it exists.
* **Write the actual test cases:**  Add assertions that verify how the decorator behaves in different scenarios (valid inputs, exceptions).

**Crucially:** The placeholder assertions (`assert True`) must be replaced with the *actual* assertions that verify the behavior you expect from the functions and methods that are called within the decorator and `Graber` class. These assertions need to check for the correct return values, side effects, or raised exceptions.


Remember to replace the placeholder assertions with your actual tests! Remember to define and import any custom exceptions needed for accurate exception handling tests.  This revised example provides a solid foundation for building more complete and effective test cases for the provided code.
