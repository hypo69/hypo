**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_version_is_a_version_object`).

2. **Type Checking:**  The tests now verify the expected types of `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `MODE`. This is crucial for ensuring that the variables are of the correct data type.

3. **Specific Checks:**  The test for `__version__` now verifies that it's a string (or potentially a more specific version string format if known).

4. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed):**  Since the example code doesn't raise exceptions, `pytest.raises` wasn't necessary, and I removed the placeholder example.

5. **Missing Attribute Handling (Placeholder):** I've included a commented-out example for how to test for missing attributes using an optional fixture. This is important in real-world scenarios where functions or classes might depend on the existence of other attributes.

6. **Fixture Example (Placeholder):** I've included a commented-out example of a test using a fixture.  You would add fixtures when your functions need some setup data to run tests correctly.

7. **Comprehensive Coverage (within Limitations):**  The tests now cover all the public attributes in the example code, verifying their type and value.

**How to Run:**

1. Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_firefox_examples.py`).
2. Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run `pytest test_firefox_examples.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the file.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Tests:**

* **More Robust Version Checking:**  If `__version__` has a specific format (e.g., major.minor.patch), add assertions to check those parts.
* **Data-Driven Tests:** If the code takes inputs, write tests for various valid and invalid inputs.
* **Error Handling:** If the code has error handling mechanisms, add tests to ensure exceptions are raised and handled correctly in specific cases.
* **Dependency Injection:** If the code interacts with other modules, test the interaction with mock objects to avoid external dependencies.
* **Fixtures:** Add fixtures for providing test data for functions that need them.

This revised solution is a more comprehensive and realistic approach to testing based on the provided Python code. Remember to tailor the test cases to the specific functions and methods you want to test. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you don't have it: `pip install packaging`
