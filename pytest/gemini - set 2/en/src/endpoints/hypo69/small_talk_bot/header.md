**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Files:** The code now includes `@pytest.fixture` for `settings_file` and `readme_file`.  These fixtures create the necessary files within temporary directories using `tmp_path`, preventing conflicts and ensuring each test runs in isolation.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test suite covers a wider range of scenarios, including:
   - Valid project structure (`test_set_project_root_valid_input`).
   - Missing marker files (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).
   - Marker files in subdirectories (`test_set_project_root_marker_in_subdirectory`).
   - Marker files not found in any directory. (`test_set_project_root_marker_not_found`).
   - Handling when the project folder already in `sys.path` (`test_set_project_root_project_in_path`).
   - Multiple marker files (`test_set_project_root_multiple_marker_files`).
   -  `FileNotFoundError` testing (`test_settings_file_not_found`, `test_readme_file_not_found`)

3. **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` using `pytest.raises` to verify the exception handling.


4. **Clearer Test Names:** The test function names are more descriptive, improving readability and understanding.

5. **Isolation:**  All tests use temporary directories (`tmp_path`) to ensure they don't interfere with each other.

6. **`sys.path` preservation (crucial):** The `test_set_project_root_project_in_path` test now correctly copies `sys.path` to avoid side effects across tests.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the test code (as `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust test suite for the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adjust the test cases based on the specific requirements and expected behavior of the function. Always test with edge cases!
