# Tests for the rest of the code (settings.json, README.MD) need mocked files
# and are omitted here for brevity, but a similar approach applies.


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The original code relies on files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`) that are not created by the code itself.  To properly test those parts, you would need to mock the file reading using `unittest.mock.patch`.  I've left the testing for those parts out of this example because they require creating and potentially cleaning up temporary files which is not ideal within a test.

2. **Temporary Directories:** The tests now create temporary directories and files to simulate the project structure, so the test doesn't rely on files already present in the file system.  Critically, it cleans up these temporary directories using `shutil.rmtree`.  This is essential for avoiding test contamination and ensuring each test runs in a clean environment.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The tests now cover various scenarios, including cases where:
   - The marker file is found in the current directory.
   - The marker file is found in a parent directory.
   - No marker file is found.
   - The marker file is found in a specified `marker_files` tuple.
   - The project root is already in `sys.path`.  This is important to check for edge cases where you might be running the tests in a modified Python environment

4. **Clearer Comments:** The test function docstrings now provide more context, explaining *why* each test is important.

5. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks in the original code for file handling are kept in the tests to mimic the expected behavior.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Make sure the `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py` file is in the same directory or in a location where `sys.path` can access it correctly.
3. Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_header.py`.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **File Content:** You'll need more robust tests for `settings.json` and `README.MD` files that verify the correctness of the loaded data.  This includes testing with various valid and invalid JSON structures.
* **Version Handling:** If the version handling in `__version__` is important, consider having dedicated tests that validate that the code correctly extracts and handles versions with expected format.
* **Error Handling:** The current example covers `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`; if other error cases are relevant, add tests for those as well.

By applying these improvements, your tests will be more robust and better reflect the real-world conditions your code might encounter. Remember to adapt the example tests to accurately reflect the function's requirements.
