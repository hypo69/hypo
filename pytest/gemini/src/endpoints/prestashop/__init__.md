**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The code now includes placeholder tests for `PrestaProduct`, `PrestaSupplier`, and `PriceListRequester`, demonStarting how to structure tests for different classes.  Crucially, these are *placeholder tests*. You need to replace the comments with actual assertions based on the expected behavior of those classes in your `prestashop` module.  Use mocks to isolate those tests from external calls.

2. **Error Handling:**  The `test_presta_product_invalid_id` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions. Replace the placeholder `with pytest.raises(...)` block with code that actually calls the method and expects a specific exception.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, e.g., `test_prestashop_initialization`.

4. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:** Fixtures are not needed in this basic example, because no external data is needed.

5. **`PrestaShop.MODE` test:** A test is added to verify the `MODE` constant.

**How to proceed:**

* **Replace placeholders:** Examine the actual `PrestaShop`, `PrestaProduct`, etc. classes. Identify the methods, their expected return values for various inputs, and expected exceptions.  Fill in the `test_presta_product_get_product_by_id` function, for example, with a mock or stub response, or a call to the `PrestaProduct` method.
* **Mock External Dependencies:** If any external services (databases, APIs) are called, you'll need to mock them with `pytest-mock` (or other mocking libraries). This is crucial for isolating your tests.
* **Thorough Testing:** Write tests for each method and constructor in each class. Consider valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and error handling.


Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
