# Changes Made

*   Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText format) to the `base64_to_tmpfile` and `base64encode` functions, including detailed parameter descriptions, return values, and examples.
*   Improved error handling. Replaced simple `try-except` blocks with more specific error handling using `logger.error` for better logging of issues and potential exceptions.  Now includes `TypeError` handling to ensure correct input types.
*   Added type hints (`-> str`) to function signatures and `:param` sections in the docstrings for better code clarity.
*   Included `TypeError` handling to ensure input validation.
*   Added proper error logging for `FileNotFoundError` for the `base64encode` function.
*   Improved variable names for clarity.
*   Added `logger` import to enable error logging.
*   Added `TODO` style comments for areas needing improvement and better explanations.
