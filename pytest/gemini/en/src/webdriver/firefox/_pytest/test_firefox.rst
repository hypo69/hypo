```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Comments:** The example code now includes placeholder comments (`# Replace with actual code...`) to guide you in adapting the tests to your actual code.

2. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The example tests now include a test for the `MODE` variable, which was the only visible part of the provided code.  It checks that the variable is set correctly and, more importantly,  tests for *invalid input* to highlight how to test exceptional scenarios. The `test_mode_invalid_input` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.  The `test_mode_empty_input` example shows how to test empty or `None` input.  Add tests for *edge cases* and *boundary cases* (if they apply to your code), by providing example tests in this section for edge cases and boundary cases.

3. **Data-Driven Tests (Example):** The example includes `@pytest.fixture` and a placeholder for a data-driven approach, which could be crucial if your functions take in several possible sets of inputs.

4. **Clear Assertions:** The assertions are now more informative, helping in debugging test failures.  Error messages are critical in case the tests fail.

**Crucial Steps for Applying to Your Code:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** Replace all the placeholder comments and example code with the actual function calls, data, and checks that need testing from your `hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/_pytest/test_firefox.py` file.

* **Identify Input Types:** Determine the types of input values the functions in your code accept (strings, integers, lists, objects, etc.).  The tests need to match these types.

* **Define Edge Cases:** For any input type, find the boundary cases, extreme values, or unusual combinations (e.g., empty strings, very large numbers, null objects, etc.).

* **Exception Handling:** If your functions raise exceptions for invalid inputs, use `pytest.raises` to verify that the correct exception is raised and the appropriate error message is returned.

* **Modularize:** Break down complex tests into smaller, more focused tests for better maintainability and readability.


By following these guidelines and filling in the placeholders with your actual code and testing logic, you can create effective `pytest` tests that thoroughly cover the functionality of your Python code. Remember to adapt the test scenarios to your specific function requirements and expected behaviors.
