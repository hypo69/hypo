```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Crucially, fixtures (`dummy_project_root`, `settings_file_content`) are introduced.  This isolates the tests from side effects and allows for creating test environments more easily.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are improved for better understanding.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover valid project roots, cases where the marker file is in the parent directory, empty marker files, invalid marker types, adding to `sys.path`, error handling for file not found, and invalid JSON.

4. **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test exception handling for invalid JSON and file not found cases.

5. **Parametrization:**  The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to test `set_project_root` with various invalid marker file types (e.g., strings, integers).

6. **Dummy Data:** `dummy_project_root` fixture now creates a proper test directory structure, making the tests more robust.


7. **Import Fixes and Correctness:**  The code now imports the correct functions and corrects the import path within the test cases, eliminating import errors.  Tests now use `from hypotez.src.suppliers.header import ...`.

8. **Test `settings_loading`:** Added robust tests for `settings` loading, including the case of a valid file, an invalid JSON file, and a missing file.  Now using `tmp_path` from pytest for creating temporary files.  Import statements are adjusted to reference the `hypotez` module properly.


This significantly improves the test suite's robustness and correctness by covering a broader range of cases and using the appropriate `pytest` features.  Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/suppliers"` with the actual path if it's different.  This solution assumes you have `hypotez/src/suppliers/header.py` within your project.  If it's in a different location, adjust the import paths accordingly.  Also, the tests now make sure to correctly handle the case where the marker files aren't found.  This is important to avoid incorrect assumptions about the project's structure.  This complete solution should significantly enhance your test coverage. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install pytest
