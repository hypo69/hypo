# Changes Made

- Added missing `from src.logger import logger` import.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for file reading in both settings and README loading.
- Added detailed error handling using `logger.error` instead of `...` for file loading exceptions.
- Added docstrings (reStructuredText format) to the `set_project_root` and `load_settings` functions.
- Rewrote all comments in reStructuredText format for better documentation.
- Improved variable naming to be more descriptive (e.g., `settings_file_path`).
- Added `load_readme` function to load README content, making the loading process reusable and improving code organization.
