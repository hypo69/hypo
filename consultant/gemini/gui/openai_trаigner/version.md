MODE = 'debug'
The Python file `version.py` is correctly structured for defining metadata about a Python project.  However, there are a few minor improvements and potential issues to address:

**Improvements:**

* **Consistent `__`:**  Use double underscores consistently for all metadata variables (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`).

* **Docstring for the module:** The module docstring (`""" module: src.gui.openai_trаigner """`) is not a typical Python docstring format.  It should be more descriptive (and potentially used as part of the `__doc__` variable).  For example:

```python
"""
This module contains version information and licensing details for the OpenAI Trainer GUI.
"""
```

* **Corrected `__cofee__`:** The link in `__cofee__` appears to have an issue (missing a `)` character).  Consider using markdown for the link, as well.


* **Improved `__copyright__`:** The current `__copyright__` format is not ideal for readability and maintainability.  Using triple-quoted strings for block content is better practice:


```python
__copyright__: str = """
Copyright (c) 2024 hypo69

This project is licensed under the MIT License.
See the MIT License for details: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

Commercial use of the code is prohibited without prior permission from the authors.
"""
```

* **Proper File Encoding:** The `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` declaration is good practice, but you might want to explicitly specify it, too, in the Python interpreter's `venv` configuration if using a different encoding.  This isn't strictly necessary for UTF-8.


**Revised `version.py`:**

```python
"""
This module contains version information and licensing details for the OpenAI Trainer GUI.
"""
__version__ = 'v1.1'
__doc__ = "GUI for training OpenAI models."
__details__ = "Detailed description of the GUI."
__author__ = 'hypo69'
__copyright__ = """
Copyright (c) 2024 hypo69

This project is licensed under the MIT License.
See the MIT License for details: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

Commercial use of the code is prohibited without prior permission from the authors.
"""
__cofee__ = "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```


**Why these changes matter:**

- **Readability:**  Improved structure enhances the clarity of the metadata.
- **Maintainability:** The code is now easier to update and maintain.
- **Documentation:** The addition of a clear module docstring enhances the informational value of the file.
- **Consistency:** Adherence to Python's naming conventions ensures better integration with other modules and tools.

**Using the metadata:**

This metadata can be easily accessed by other scripts, modules, or tools within your project.  Example:

```python
import importlib.resources

# Get the version from version.py
try:
    module = importlib.resources.files("hypotez.src.gui.openai_trаigner")
    with open(module / "version.py") as f:
        module_lines = f.readlines()
    version_line = next(l for l in module_lines if l.startswith("__version__"))
    version = version_line.split("=")[1].strip().strip("'\"")
    print(f"OpenAI Trainer version: {version}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading version: {e}")
```

This more robust example handles potential issues and displays the version in a clear format. Remember to adjust the path based on your specific project structure if it differs. Remember to use `importlib.resources` if you're using a relatively recent Python version. Older versions may use `pkg_resources`.
