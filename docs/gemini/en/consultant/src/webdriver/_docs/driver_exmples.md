### Changes Made

- Added missing imports for `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Implemented error handling using `try...except` blocks and `logger.error` for better error management.
- Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to the `main` function and module docstrings.
- Replaced `#` comments with more descriptive and RST-compliant comments.
- Improved comment clarity and consistency.
