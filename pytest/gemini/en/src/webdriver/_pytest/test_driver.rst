**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **More Comprehensive `test_scroll`:**  The test now checks both the `forward` and `backward` scroll directions, as well as a `both` scroll.  It also adds an example of how to test for invalid input types. This is crucial for robust testing.
* **`test_get_url` with Invalid Input:**  It now tests for an invalid URL (None) which is critical.
* **Exception Handling with `pytest.raises`:**  Demonstrates using `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions (`TypeError` in `test_scroll`).
* **Clearer Assertions:**  More specific assertions are made to verify the expected behavior.
* **Important Exception Handling:** added a check that no exception is raised, which is critical for the `driver_payload` method, ensuring that mocked methods don't raise exceptions.


**Important Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **`gs` Variable:**  The code depends on a global variable `gs`.  For production-level testing, you should refactor this to use a fixture to pass in the necessary context to your driver instance (e.g., the directory for cookies, etc.) instead of a global.
* **Error Handling:**  Add tests to verify how the code handles various exceptions (e.g., `InvalidArgumentException` from Selenium).
* **File System Interactions:** When testing file system operations, consider using temporary directories to avoid interfering with your system's real files.
* **Mocking `open` and `pickle`:** In `test_save_cookies_localy` and `delete_driver_logs`, the `open` and `pickle` calls are mocked which is fine.  You may need to add more specific mocking for those functions, such as mocking the behavior of the file being opened for write and the directory existing.


**Example of using a fixture for `gs`:**


```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

@pytest.fixture
def gs_mock():
    """Mocks the gs object for testing"""
    gs_mock = Mock()
    gs_mock.dir_cookies = "/cookies"
    gs_mock.dir_logs = "/tmp"
    return gs_mock
```

```python
# ... (inside a test method)
def test_save_cookies_localy(self, driver_base, gs_mock):
    """Test _save_cookies_localy method with gs fixture"""
    # ... (rest of your test)
    gs = gs_mock
    # ... (rest of your test)
```



Remember to replace placeholders like `/path/to/cookies` with appropriate values or fixtures. Remember to adapt the test cases to fit the actual function signatures and error handling mechanisms of your code.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the reliability of your driver code.
