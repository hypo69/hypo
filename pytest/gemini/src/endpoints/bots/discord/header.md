**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Introduced fixtures (`mock_pyproject_toml`, `mock_settings_json`, etc.) to create temporary directories and files for testing different scenarios without affecting the real project structure.  This isolates tests and is crucial for proper `pytest` testing.


2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.


3. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** The tests now cover cases where the project root is found immediately, when it's several levels up, when no marker files are found, and when files are missing or have invalid content.


4. **Exception Handling:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, which are essential for robustness.  The `test_settings_file_not_found` and `test_settings_file_invalid_json` now properly handle expected exceptions.


5. **`sys.path` Consideration:** Added `test_set_project_root_project_in_sys_path` to ensure that sys.path is not being modified unnecessarily if the directory is already present.


6. **Edge Cases (No Marker Files):** Added `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` to cover the scenario where no marker files are specified


7. **Robustness:**  Crucially, added  cleanup for temporary files (`Path(mock_pyproject_toml / "src").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`) within tests. This prevents tests from failing due to leftovers from previous test runs


8. **Using correct pathlib:** Imports `Path` correctly from `pathlib` to make the code cleaner and more readable and allows for working on Windows and Unix.



This revised solution significantly improves the test coverage and robustness. Remember to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```


Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual path to your project if it's different.  This updated answer provides a much more comprehensive and reliable test suite. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual structure of your project.
