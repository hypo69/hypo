**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `Currency`:** The code now correctly imports the `Currency` class from the specified file. This is crucial for pytest to find and test the class's attributes.

2. **Comprehensive Constant Tests:**  Tests are added to verify the values of all currency constants and ensure they are strings. It checks for empty strings and for potential duplicate values, making sure the constants are well-defined.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names are now much more descriptive about the purpose of the test, improving readability.

4. **`pytest.raises` for Attribute Errors:** Added a test (`test_currency_attribute_error`) to demonStarte how to use `pytest.raises` for catching `AttributeError` if trying to access a nonexistent attribute.  This is an important check for robustness.

5. **Type Checking:** Added `test_currency_constants_no_case_conversion` to validate that the currency constants are strings, which is essential for the program's correctness and to anticipate potential issues related to type mismatches in subsequent operations.

6. **No Empty String Values:**  Added `test_currency_constants_values` to verify that the constants are not empty strings.

7. **No Duplicate Constants:** Added `test_currency_constants_no_duplicates` to check for potential duplicate constant definitions. This is a good practice in general.


This revised solution provides a more thorough and robust set of tests that cover various aspects of the `Currency` class, including edge cases and error handling.  It follows best practices for writing effective pytest tests. Remember to save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_currencies.py`) in the same directory as your `currencies.py` file to run the tests using `pytest`. Remember to replace  `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/models/currencies.py` with the actual path if needed.


```bash
# Run the tests using pytest
pytest test_currencies.py
