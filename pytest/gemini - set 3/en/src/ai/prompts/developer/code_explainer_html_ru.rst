```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Replace `add_numbers`:**  The example `add_numbers` function is placeholder.  You *must* replace it with the actual Python code you want to test.

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The provided tests cover:
   - Valid integer inputs
   - Valid float inputs
   - Zero as an input
   - Invalid input type (non-numeric)
   - Very large numbers
   - Very small numbers

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_add_numbers_invalid_input_type` function demonStartes how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`. This is crucial for robust testing.

4. **Clear Test Names:**  The test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test, which is essential for readability and maintainability.

5. **Edge Cases:**  Tests for very large and very small numbers are included as examples of edge cases.  You need to adapt these tests based on the *actual* expected behavior of your code (e.g., integer overflow).  It's critical to check for any such limits or boundary conditions for your code.

6. **Missing Code:** The crucial part is to provide the `add_numbers` function.  Without the provided Python code, these tests are useless.

**How to use these tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the tests (e.g., as `test_add_numbers.py`).
2. **Run:** Open a terminal in the same directory and run `pytest test_add_numbers.py`.

**Important additions:**
- **Error Handling:** The example `add_numbers` now includes error handling (raising `TypeError`) for non-numeric inputs. Your tests need to include tests for these exceptional cases.
- **Clearer Docstrings:** Docstrings are added to both the function and tests for better understanding and readability. This is important for anyone trying to use or debug your code.


Remember to adapt these tests to the specific function(s) and classes within the provided code.  Without the code, I can't provide precise, meaningful tests.
