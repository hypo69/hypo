```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.

# Example of how to write tests if there was Python code:
# Example function to test
# def my_function(input_data):
#     if input_data > 10:
#         return input_data * 2
#     else:
#         return "Input is not greater than 10"

# def test_my_function_valid_input():
#     """Checks correct behavior with valid input."""
#     result = my_function(15)
#     assert result == 30


# def test_my_function_invalid_input():
#     """Checks correct handling of invalid input."""
#     result = my_function(5)
#     assert result == "Input is not greater than 10"

# def test_my_function_edge_case():
#     """Checks behavior with edge cases."""
#     result = my_function(10)
#     assert result == "Input is not greater than 10"

# def test_my_function_raises_exception():
#   with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#     my_function("invalid input")

# Note:  If the HTML file contained external JavaScript files with 
# Python code that could be executed within the browser context,
#  tests would need to interact with the browser and these JavaScript files.
#  Selenium or similar tools would be necessary then to test these. 
#  Those are beyond the scope of this basic response.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is purely HTML and doesn't contain any Python code.  Therefore, there's nothing to test directly.

* **No Python Code:**  The `input_code` snippet is just HTML, not Python.  You need Python code (functions, classes, etc.) to write tests with `pytest`.

* **Testing Web Extensions:**  To test a browser extension, you usually need a testing framework like Selenium or Playwright.  These tools automate browser interactions, allowing you to simulate user actions (like clicking the extension icon) and verify the extension's behavior.

* **JavaScript and Interactions:**  The actual functionality of an extension often resides in JavaScript.  To test the JavaScript components in the `popup.html`, you would need a testing framework to execute JavaScript code (like the browser's dev tools or Playwright).  You'd also need to understand how the Python code interacts with the JavaScript code.

* **Example Addition:** The example code I included demonStartes how you would create test functions using `pytest` for a hypothetical Python function.  Adapt this structure (tests and the function) when you have the Python code part of your extension.


If you have the Python code that's being used *by* or *with* the JavaScript of the extension, please provide that code, and I can generate appropriate, targeted `pytest` tests.
