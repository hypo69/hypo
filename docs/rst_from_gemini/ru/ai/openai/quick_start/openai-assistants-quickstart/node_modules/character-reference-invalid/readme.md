## What is this?

This package provides a map of invalid numeric character references (those that are not valid in HTML) to their replacements according to the HTML specification.  Specifically, it maps C1 ASCII/Unicode control characters to their Windows-1252 equivalents.


## When should I use this?

This package is primarily useful for handling situations where you need to normalize or sanitize HTML that might contain these invalid character references.  For most modern applications, the correct approach is to ensure valid Unicode encoding.

```

In Deno, use Skypack:

```typescript
import { characterReferenceInvalid } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-reference-invalid@2?dts';

In browsers, use Skypack:

```


## Usage

import { characterReferenceInvalid } from 'character-reference-invalid';

console.log(characterReferenceInvalid[0x80]); // Output: €

console.log(characterReferenceInvalid[0x99]); // Output: ™
```
