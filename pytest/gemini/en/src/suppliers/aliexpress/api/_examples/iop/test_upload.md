**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `file_bytes`:** The crucial addition is the `mock_file_content` fixture.  This prevents your tests from trying to open a real file (`/Users/xt/Documents/work/tasp/tasp/pom.xml`), which is a bad idea for testing.  The test now uses the mock content.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Uses `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions, like missing/empty file content, to ensure the code handles errors correctly.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now have more specific assertions on the `response` object (e.g., checking the `type`, `code`, `message`).
* **Invalid Input Tests:** Added tests for `None` file name and empty file content.
* **Invalid URL Test:** Added a test to check the case where the API endpoint is invalid.
* **`client_instance` Fixture:**  Now the `client_instance` is a fixture, which is good practice to prevent creating the client instance in every test function.
* **Error Message Assertions:** Asserts on the error messages returned by the code, which is important for debugging and understanding the exact cause of failures.


**Before Running:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Replace Placeholders:** Update `'${appKey}'` and `'${appSecret}'` with actual values (or better, mock them as appropriate)

3.  **Replace `iop`:** Make sure the `iop` module exists and is importable in your test environment. If necessary adjust the import statement accordingly (e.g., if you have to add a `from ... import iop`).

Now you have a robust set of tests that thoroughly cover the different aspects of the upload functionality. Remember to add more specific test cases based on any known edge cases, exceptional scenarios or specific error codes you are expecting. Remember to replace the `mock_file_content` with appropriate content when testing the code.
