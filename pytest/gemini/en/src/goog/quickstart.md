```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid credentials, missing `token.json`, invalid credentials, and a simulated API error.
* **Mocking:** Critically important, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `build` function and other external calls. This isolates the `quickstart.main` function from the external dependencies and allows testing different scenarios without interacting with Google's API.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_main_http_error` test specifically demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to catch and assert on `errors.HttpError`.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are improved to check for the correct behavior, such as the print statements (when no `token.json` is present or when an API error occurs). The assertions are more focused and specific, improving test reliability.
* **Realistic Error Simulation:** The `MockHttpError` class simulates a real API error, allowing the `test_main_http_error` to test the error handling pathway.
* **No Unnecessary Imports:** Removed unnecessary imports, making the code cleaner and more focused.
* **Valid Credential Test:** Added a test (`test_main_valid_credentials`) to confirm the correct behavior when valid credentials exist. This addresses a missing test case.


This revised solution provides more robust and reliable tests for the `quickstart.py` code, ensuring that it handles various situations correctly. Remember to have `credentials.json` in the same directory as your test file for the tests to run correctly. Also, ensure that the `gs` module is correctly implemented. Remember to replace `'test_token'` with the actual token for your testing purposes.
