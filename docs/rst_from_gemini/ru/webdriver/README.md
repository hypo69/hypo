# WebDriver Executor Module (Driver)

This document outlines the `Driver` module, a crucial component for web automation using Selenium WebDriver. This module provides a robust framework for interacting with web pages, handling various actions, and managing the browser session.

## Module Overview

The `Driver` module extends the functionality of Selenium WebDriver by providing additional methods for scrolling, cookie management, and page interaction. It leverages the core WebDriver capabilities but introduces enhancements for intricate automation tasks.

**Core Concept:**

The module is built around a base class (`DriverBase`) which defines common actions like scrolling, extracting domains, saving cookies, and refreshing pages. This base class is then dynamically combined with specific WebDriver implementations (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) via a metaclass (`DriverMeta`). This approach allows for flexible and extensible automation.


## Key Components and Functionality

### 1. DriverBase Class

- **Attributes:**
    - `previous_url`: Stores the previous URL visited.
    - `referrer`: Stores the referrer URL.
    - `page_lang`: Stores the page's language.
    - `driver`: The underlying Selenium WebDriver instance.
    - `actions`: ActionChains instance for complex interactions.
    - `logger`: Logger instance for reporting events and errors.
    - `user_agent`: Holds the custom user agent (if provided).


- **Methods:**
    - `scroll`: Scrolls the page to specified positions. Includes parameters for direction ('forward', 'backward') and delay to prevent errors.
    - `locale`: Determines the page's language (using meta tags or JavaScript)
    - `get_url`: Navigates to the given URL. Returns a boolean success indicator.
    - `extract_domain`: Extracts the domain from a URL.
    - `_save_cookies_localy`: Saves cookies to a local file.
    - `page_refresh`: Refreshes the current page.
    - `window_focus`: Focuses the browser window using JavaScript.
    - `wait`: Introduces a delay (used for handling asynchronous operations).
    - `delete_driver_logs`: Clears the browser logs (useful for cleaning up after test runs).
    -  `execute_locator`, `click`, `get_webelement_as_screenshot`, `get_attribute_by_locator`, `send_message`:  Wrapper methods to execute commands on elements identified by locators (delegated to the `ExecuteLocator` class).


### 2. DriverMeta Class

- **Methods:**
    - `__call__`: This is the key method for dynamically creating the `Driver` class. It takes a WebDriver class (like `Chrome`) as input and combines it with the `DriverBase` class to create a specialized driver.


### 3. Driver Class

- **Description:**
    - The actual driver class, created dynamically by `DriverMeta`. It inherits from `DriverBase` and the specified WebDriver implementation (e.g., `Chrome`, `Firefox`).
    - It provides a unified interface for common web automation tasks.
    - Implements crucial methods to interact with web elements, send messages, capture screenshots, and handle errors.

## Usage Examples

```python
from src.webdriver import Driver, Chrome
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# ... (other imports and settings)

# Create a Chrome driver instance
chrome_driver = Driver(Chrome)

# Navigate to a URL
if chrome_driver.get_url("https://www.example.com"):
    print("Successfully navigated")

# Find an element by CSS selector
element = chrome_driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'h1')
if element:
    print(element.text)

# ... other usage examples (e.g., scrolling, cookie handling, etc.) ...
```


## Dependencies

- **Selenium:**  Crucial for browser interactions.
- **Python Libraries:** (`sys`, `pickle`, `time`, `copy`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `urllib.parse`, `selenium.webdriver`, `selenium.common.exceptions`) – for essential functionalities.
- **Internal Modules:**  `gs` (global settings), `executor`, `javascript`, `utils`, `logger`, `exceptions` – for various utilities and error handling.


## Error Handling

The `Driver` module employs robust error handling. Exceptions, like `NoSuchElementException` and `TimeoutException`, are caught and logged appropriately, preventing script crashes and enabling graceful error recovery.

## Note on `ExecuteLocator`

The `Driver` module delegates element interaction tasks to an internal `ExecuteLocator` class, making the core structure cleaner and more organized.  `ExecuteLocator` is not directly exposed in this example overview.  It is likely to be an internal helper class dedicated to finding and interacting with elements.  Referencing the `ExecuteLocator` class's API should be done in accordance with the API documentation for that specific class.
