# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/category.py

## Overview

This module provides functions for fetching product information from the HB (hb.co.il) supplier's website. It handles category browsing, product listing extraction, and product page scraping.  The module utilizes a WebDriver for interacting with the website and a `Supplier` object for contextual information.

## Functions

### `get_list_products_in_category`

**Description**: This function retrieves a list of product URLs from a given category page. It handles potential pagination by checking for and following pagination links on the page.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (Supplier): An instance of the Supplier class containing necessary information (e.g., driver, locators, current scenario) for interacting with the website.

**Returns**:

- `list[str, str, None]`: A list of product URLs. Returns `None` if no product URLs are found.  The type is listed as a list of strings, but the returned data structure is complex and should be examined in the `get_list_products_in_category` implementation for better documentation of the list structure.


**Raises**:

-  `Exception`: Generic exception handling if something unexpected happens during the scraping process.


### `paginator`

**Description**:  Handles the pagination of the product listing. It checks if the next page exists and appends the product URLs to the `list_products_in_category`.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the WebDriver class used for interacting with the website.
- `locator` (dict): A dictionary containing locators for elements on the page.
- `list_products_in_category` (list): The list of product URLs currently collected.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if there is a next page to load, `False` if no more pages exist.  Handles empty lists gracefully and logs a warning message.


**Raises**:

- `Exception`: Generic exception handling if something unexpected happens during the pagination process.


### `get_list_categories_from_site`

**Description**: This function retrieves a list of active categories from the HB website. The details are not elaborated in the provided code.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (Supplier): An instance of the Supplier class to provide context for the scraping operation.

**Returns**:

- `...`: Returns the list of categories (details are not given in the provided code fragment).


**Raises**:

- `Exception`: Generic exception handling if an error occurs during the category retrieval process.


## Module Level Attributes

### MODE

**Description**:  A variable defining the current mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod'). Its meaning and purpose are not elaborated in the code.


## Notes

The provided code snippet contains significant `...` placeholders.  These indicate that critical parts of the functionality are omitted.  To produce comprehensive documentation, the missing logic (e.g., locator definitions, error handling, and specific logic for pagination) should be included.   The `typing` hints for `get_list_products_in_category` should also be clarified (especially the `list[str, str, None]`).  The function parameters and return types likely need further clarification in `Supplier` object and the underlying structure of data.
