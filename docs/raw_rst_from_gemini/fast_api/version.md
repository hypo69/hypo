try:
    with open('../settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    print("Warning: settings.json not found or invalid. Using default values.")

__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''
__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''  # Corrected typo
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **`__copyright__` Typo Fix:**  The variable name `__copyrihgnt__` was incorrect; it's corrected to `__copyright__`.  This is a crucial fix to ensure the code runs as intended.

* **Clear Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now includes a `print()` statement.  This is better practice because it informs the user (or a logging system) if `settings.json` is not found or has invalid JSON.  This helps with debugging.  Using `print` here is not the best practice but since you haven't specified logging, I added it as an improvement.


**How to use this file:**

This file (`version.py`) should be used in your FastAPI application.   It provides variables that other modules can import, and those variables hold project metadata (name, version, author, etc).  

**Example usage (in another Python file):**

```python
from fast_api.version import __version__

print(f"Current version: {__version__}")
```


**Important Considerations (Beyond the Code):**

* **`settings.json`:** Make sure that `settings.json` exists in the correct location (`../settings.json`) relative to `version.py`.  This file should contain your project's configuration, including the version number and other relevant metadata.  Example `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2023, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```

* **Error Handling (Beyond print):** For production code, replace the `print()` statement in the `except` block with logging, to properly record errors and provide more informative messages without interrupting the program's flow.

* **Versioning Strategy:**  Consider a more robust versioning scheme.  The `__version__` should adhere to a semantic versioning scheme (e.g., `major.minor.patch`).

* **`__doc__` and `__details__`:**  These are currently empty. Add meaningful documentation and details about your project if available.


By addressing these points, you can create a more robust and maintainable project structure. Remember to replace the placeholder values in `settings.json` with your project's actual data.
