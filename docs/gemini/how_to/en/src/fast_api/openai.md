How to use the `hypotez/src/fast_api/openai.py` module

This module provides a FastAPI application for interacting with the OpenAI model.  It exposes endpoints for querying the model and, potentially, training.  This guide details how to use the provided API endpoints.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Python:** Ensure Python 3.12 or higher is installed.
*   **FastAPI:** `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic`
*   **OpenAI:**  You'll need an OpenAI API key, properly configured.  Ensure the necessary OpenAI libraries are installed. This code likely uses a custom `OpenAIModel` class; ensure that class is correctly implemented and has the appropriate OpenAI integration.
*   **Other dependencies:** Verify all required libraries from `src` and `src.utils` are installed.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **`AskRequest`:** A Pydantic model defining the input structure for the `/ask` endpoint.  You must provide a `message` string, and optionally a `system_instruction` string.

*   **`/ask` Endpoint:** This is the primary endpoint for querying the OpenAI model.


**Using the `/ask` Endpoint**

This endpoint allows you to submit a request to the OpenAI model for processing.  The response will contain the model's generated output.

**Example Usage (using `curl`):**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
  -d '{\\\"message\\\": \\\"Hello, what is the capital of France?\\\", \\\"system_instruction\\\": \\\"Give a short answer.\\\"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask
```

**Explanation:**

*   `-X POST`: Specifies a POST request to the `/ask` endpoint.
*   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the content type to JSON. Crucial for sending data in the correct format.
*   `-d '{...}'`: Provides the request body as a JSON string.  Make sure your `message` and `system_instruction` match the `AskRequest` model.
*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask`: The URL of the endpoint.

**Example Usage (using Python):**

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask"

data = {
    "message": "Tell me a joke",
    "system_instruction": "Keep it clean."
}

headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
    result = response.json()
    print(result)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Error Handling:**

The code includes robust error handling within the FastAPI application. If any error occurs during the request processing, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned with a detailed error message (logged in `logger`).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Messages:** Carefully examine the error messages returned by the server (500 status codes) to understand and fix issues.

*   **Input Validation:**  The `AskRequest` model provides some validation.  However, consider additional input validation in your application logic to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.


**Running the Application:**

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing `hypotez/src/fast_api/openai.py` and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn hypotez.src.fast_api.openai:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.  The `--reload` flag is useful for development, automatically reloading the application when the code changes.

**Further development:**

*   The provided example demonstrates the `/ask` endpoint. The code may include other endpoints (like those related to model training). Refer to your full codebase for those details.
*   Consider implementing more advanced error handling techniques to manage various exceptions more gracefully.
*   Ensure proper authentication and authorization if needed.
