# Changes Made

*   Added missing import statements (`from src.logger import logger`, `import sys`).
*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings for the module and the included class.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` (assuming `j_loads` is defined elsewhere).
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for potential exceptions related to execution mode setting.
*   Corrected and refined the comments to be more specific and accurate.
*   Added a try-except block to handle cases where a command-line argument is not provided correctly.  
*   Improved code structure for clear separation of concerns.
*   Comments added for explanation of code blocks.
