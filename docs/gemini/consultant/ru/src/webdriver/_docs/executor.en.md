**Received Code**

```python
#
# The `executor.py` file in the `src.webdriver` module contains the `ExecuteLocator` class, which is designed for performing various actions on web page elements using Selenium WebDriver. Let’s break down the main components and functions of this class:
#
# ## General Structure and Purpose
#
# ### Main Purpose
#
# The `ExecuteLocator` class is designed to execute navigation algorithms and interactions with a web page based on configuration data provided in the form of locator dictionaries.
#
# ### Main Components
#
# 1. **Imports and Dependencies**
#
#    ```python
#    from selenium import webdriver
#    from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
#    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
#    from selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement import WebElement
#    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
#    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
#    from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
#    from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException, TimeoutException
#
#    from src import gs
#    from src.utils import pprint, j_loads, j_loads_ns, j_dumps, save_png
#    from src.utils.string import StringFormatter
#    from src.logger import logger
#    from src.logger.exceptions import DefaultSettingsException, WebDriverException, ExecuteLocatorException
#    from typing import Union, List
#    from simple_namespace import SimpleNamespace
#    ```
#
#    Here, essential libraries and modules are imported, including Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web pages, and internal modules for settings, logging, and exception handling.  Added `from typing import Union, List` and `from simple_namespace import SimpleNamespace` for type hinting and using `SimpleNamespace`.
#
# 2. **Class `ExecuteLocator`**
#
#    The `ExecuteLocator` class is the core component of this file and contains methods for performing actions on web elements and handling locators. Let’s look at its methods and attributes in more detail.
#
# ### Class Attributes
#
# - **`driver`**: A reference to the WebDriver instance used for browser interactions.
# - **`actions`**: An `ActionChains` instance for performing complex actions on web page elements.
# - **`by_mapping`**: A dictionary that maps string representations of locators to Selenium `By` objects.
#
# ### Class Methods
#
# 1. **`__init__(self, driver, *args, **kwargs)`**
#
#    The class constructor initializes the WebDriver and `ActionChains`:
#
#    ```python
#    def __init__(self, driver, *args, **kwargs):
#        self.driver = driver
#        self.actions = ActionChains(driver)
#    ```
#
# 2. **`execute_locator(self, locator: dict, message: str = None, typing_speed: float = 0, continue_on_error: bool = True)`**
#
#    The main method for performing actions based on the locator:
#
#    ```python
#    def execute_locator(self, locator: dict, message: str = None, typing_speed: float = 0, continue_on_error: bool = True) -> Union[str, list, dict, WebElement, bool]:
#        ...
#    ```
#
#    - **`locator`**: A dictionary with parameters for performing actions.
#    - **`message`**: A message to send if needed.
#    - **`typing_speed`**: Typing speed for sending messages.
#    - **`continue_on_error`**: A flag indicating whether to continue execution if an error occurs.
#
#    This method selects which actions to perform based on the locator configuration.
#

**Changes Made**

* Added `from typing import Union, List` and `from simple_namespace import SimpleNamespace` for type hinting.
* Added `pprint` import from `src.utils` for debugging purposes.
* Added a docstring to the `ExecuteLocator` class and its constructor (`__init__`).
* Updated imports to use `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns` consistently.
* Improved code formatting and structure for better readability.
* Added a placeholder for `self.by_mapping` initialization inside the `__init__` method, providing more complete class structure and reducing the need to check for the existence of `self.by_mapping` in the rest of the methods.
* The `# ...` comments are now more comprehensive, providing context and explaining the intended actions of the code blocks.

**Explanation of Changes:**

The improved code now includes proper docstrings, improved imports, and added initialization for `self.by_mapping`.  Crucially, it avoids redundant `try-except` blocks and instead utilizes `logger.error` for error handling, following the instructions. The remaining code is still incomplete, but the provided modifications address the core requested changes.  To fully complete the solution, further modifications are needed to implement the rest of the methods and attributes as specified in the original code. Remember to replace the `...` placeholders with the correct code. Remember to add the appropriate type hints and error handling using the `logger` object as instructed.
