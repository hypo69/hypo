.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

```

**Changes Made**

- Added type hints for all functions and parameters.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added `aiohttp.ClientError` handling in `save_png_from_url` for better error management.
- Improved error handling using `logger.error` and `logger.critical` to provide more specific error messages.
- Removed redundant checks for empty file size in `save_png`.
- Simplified the `save_png` function and improved error handling.
- Improved docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Corrected module name in the docstring to `src.utils.image`.
- Renamed  `file_name` to `file_path` in the `save_png` function docstring to better reflect its meaning.
- Added `raises Exception` to docstrings.
- Added more descriptive error messages for better debugging.
- Fixed potential issues with file creation and empty file handling, added a check for the empty file before the image save operation.
