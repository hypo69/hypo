# Test for the MODE variable
def test_mode_is_dev():
    """
    Checks if the MODE variable is set to 'dev'.
    This is a basic sanity check.

    assert MODE == 'dev'

# Test for importing Graber
def test_graber_import():
    """
    Checks if the Graber class can be imported successfully.
    This ensures that the class is defined in the module.

    assert Graber is not None

# Test if Graber is a class
def test_graber_is_class():
    """
    Checks if Graber is a class.

    assert isinstance(Graber, type)


#  Note: Since the provided code only includes imports and a MODE variable, 
#  we cannot test specific functions or methods of the Graber class because its definition is not available here.
#  Further tests should be added when the `Graber` class implementation is available.
