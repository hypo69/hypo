**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mock Data:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create mock `pyproject.toml`, `settings.json`, and `README.MD` files within a temporary directory. This isolates the tests and avoids affecting the actual project directory.  Critically, `mock_project_root` is used in subsequent tests which helps avoid testing unexpected paths.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for various scenarios, including:
    * Valid input (existing `pyproject.toml`).
    * Multiple marker files.
    * No marker files found (should return current directory).
    * Invalid marker files (file doesn't exist).
    * Recursive directory structure.
* **Exception Handling:** The tests now use `pytest.raises` to check the correct behavior when `settings.json` is not found or if the content is invalid JSON. (Error is handled properly so these tests don't fail)
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive and explicit.
* **Mocking `gs`:**   The tests now use a `mock_project_root` to set the `gs` module to the mock path; this avoids needing to create a temporary folder in the same place as the source files. This is vital for avoiding issues in the real project.
* **Import Fixes:**  Import statements are adjusted for `gs` and `hypotez.src`, ensuring appropriate import paths are used. This is a critical fix from the previous response and would have caused runtime errors.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Install pytest:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_logger.py
    ```

This improved solution addresses the previous issues and provides a much more robust test suite for the `set_project_root` function.  The use of fixtures is essential for clean, reproducible testing. Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual path if needed.
