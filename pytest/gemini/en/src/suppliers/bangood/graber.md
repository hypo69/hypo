**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Critically, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `Context` objects.  This is essential for isolating the tests and preventing them from interacting with a real web driver which would be slow and unreliable.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test exceptions.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and check for the expected types and behavior.
* **Handling Missing Data:** The `test_grab_page_missing_data` test now checks for cases where data fetching functions might not return a value, which would throw an error in the real code.  Mock functions are used to simulate this.
* **Exception Handling Test:**  `test_grab_page_with_exception` ensures the `grab_page` method properly handles `ExecuteLocatorException` â€“ crucial for robustness.
* **Asynchronous Test Running:**  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is corrected to use `asyncio.run` to run the tests properly in an event loop. This is essential for testing asynchronous functions like `grab_page`.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Real Data:**  For realistic testing, you would need to mock the parts of the code that interact with the external web driver, databases, etc, to test them with "realistic" though simulated inputs and outputs.  However, that is beyond the scope of this example and relies on the specific structure of your project code.


**Crucial Missing Information:**

*   **`ProductFields` class:**  The tests need to know how to assert on the contents of a `ProductFields` object. You need to know how these objects are populated. If `ProductFields` is a Pydantic model, it will typically have a good default for that.  This was missing from your provided code.
*   **Data fetching functions (`id_product`, `description_short`, etc.):**  In a real-world scenario, these functions likely make requests to a web page, so you should test the specific expected behavior within them. The `test_grab_page_missing_data` shows how to test these functions.
*   **`Graber` Methods:** Tests for the other methods in the `Graber` class are also needed (e.g., `id_product`, `description_short`).  These must be mocked/stubbed appropriately for testing within this class.

By addressing these points, the test suite will be more comprehensive and reliable for detecting potential issues in the `Graber` class. Remember to provide the `ProductFields` class definition (and data for these fields), which is essential for correct and reliable testing of `grab_page`.
