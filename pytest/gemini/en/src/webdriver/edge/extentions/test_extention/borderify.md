**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`js2py`:** The code now uses the `js2py` library.  This is *essential* because directly interacting with a browser's DOM from a Python test is problematic (and often impossible). `js2py` allows us to run JavaScript in a controlled environment, minimizing security risks.

2. **Error Handling:**  The `run_js_code` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch and report any errors during JavaScript execution. This is crucial for robust testing.


3. **Test Focus:** The tests now focus on checking *execution* of the JavaScript code and whether it triggers any errors, rather than asserting on browser state which is inaccessible from the Python side. The `test_borderify_sets_border` is a best-effort test.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** The `test_borderify_invalid_border_style` example uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions, which is the correct approach for failure conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:** The `test_borderify_no_code` test demonstrates a more comprehensive testing approach by checking for the behavior of empty input.

6. **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages now include details about the JavaScript errors, enhancing debugging capabilities.


**Important Considerations (and limitations):**

* **Alert Handling:** The tests cannot directly verify the appearance of an alert box because `js2py` does not provide a way to interact with browser dialogs. The tests will be designed to verify the execution of the JavaScript code that generates the alert.

* **Browser Environment:**  These tests are not executing in a real browser context.  This limits the ability to test for actual user-visible behavior.

* **Real-world Use:** To verify that the JavaScript code correctly modifies the browser's displayed elements (e.g., the border), you would need a fully functional browser automation framework (e.g., using Selenium) to get access to the browser's DOM.  This is beyond the scope of the `js2py` approach.


This revised solution provides a much more realistic and reliable way to test JavaScript code, given the limitations of directly interacting with a browser from Python. Remember to install `js2py`: `pip install js2py`. Remember to adjust the tests based on the actual expected behavior of the JavaScript code and whether it is intended to raise errors or produce outputs in the browser environment. Remember that this set of tests is not able to test DOM manipulations because `js2py` is a JavaScript interpreter.
