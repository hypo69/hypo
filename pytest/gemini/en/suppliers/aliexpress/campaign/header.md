```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes mocking (`monkeypatch`) to isolate the tests.  It mocks `open`, `json.load`, and the `gs` module to prevent interactions with the file system and external dependencies, making tests more reliable.
* **Clearer Fixtures:**  Fixtures now clearly define their purpose and return values.
* **Edge Case Tests:** Added a test for when the marker file is in a subfolder, and a test for the case where no marker files are found.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The tests now handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` gracefully, ensuring the code behaves correctly under various error conditions.
* **Valid/Invalid Input:** Tests for cases where the settings file is valid and when it doesn't exist or contains malformed JSON.
* **Comprehensive `README.md` Tests:** Added tests for both the case where the file exists and the case where the file is missing.
* **File Handling:** Mocks `open` to avoid interacting with the filesystem during testing, crucial for isolation.
* **`__root__` handling:** Ensures that __root__ is added to `sys.path`, crucial for the actual code to work. 
* **`monkeypatch` for Isolation:** Utilizes `monkeypatch` to replace `open` function.
* **pytest.raises:** Removed unnecessary use of `pytest.raises`, as appropriate tests already fail if expected exceptions are not raised.
* **Descriptive Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive test suite for the provided code. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest` and `json`.  Run the tests with `pytest`. Remember to adjust the paths in the `MockGS` class if your project structure changes. This solution focuses on testing the core logic, ensuring the function's behavior is correct regardless of the external dependencies it interacts with.
