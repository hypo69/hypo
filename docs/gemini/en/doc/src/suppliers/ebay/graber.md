# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/ebay/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is a subclass of the `Grbr` class. It's responsible for gathering product data from the `ebay.com` website.  The `Graber` class inherits the general data grabbing functionality from `Grbr`, adding specific handling for `ebay` product pages. Each field on the product page is handled by a dedicated function; specialized handling can be implemented within this class by overriding functions.  The module includes a decorator (`@close_pop_up`) for potentially performing actions prior to the main data gathering function, and supports asynchronous operations using `asyncio`.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class handles the process of gathering product information from the eBay website. It inherits from the `Grbr` class (likely a base Graber class).

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): An instance of the webdriver class to interact with the browser.


#### `grab_page`

**Description**: Asynchronously gathers product fields from the specified product page.

**Parameters**:
- `driver` (Driver): The driver instance used for interaction with the browser.

**Returns**:
- `ProductFields`: A dataclass containing the gathered product fields.  More specific type information is needed for accurate documentation.


## Functions

### `close_pop_up` (commented out)

**Description**: (Commented out, therefore not used.)  This function (if uncommented) defines a decorator to close pop-up windows before executing the wrapped function.

**Parameters**:
- `value` (Any): Additional value for the decorator.

**Returns**:
- `Callable`: A decorator that wraps the provided function.

**Raises**:
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: If there's an error executing the locator for closing the pop-up.



## Notes

- The code contains extensive comments explaining the purpose and functionality of various parts, including details on asynchronous operations and possible customizations.
- The code includes numerous `await` statements, indicating asynchronous operations.
- A large number of fields are potentially extracted, but without detailed knowledge of the `ProductFields` dataclass structure, it's impossible to provide complete documentation.
