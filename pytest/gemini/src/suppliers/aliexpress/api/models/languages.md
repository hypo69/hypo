# Test block for missing or incorrect imports (optional but highly recommended)
if Language is None:

  pytest.exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code for failed import


# Test cases assuming the file import worked successfully.
# These tests would be here if the import worked.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to handle potential `ModuleNotFoundError` if the file path is incorrect.  It sets `Language` to `None` if the import fails, preventing errors later. Crucially, it also includes a test to check if `Language` is still `None` *after* the import, thus preventing runtime errors if the import fails, printing a helpful message, and exiting with failure.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_language_constants`).

3. **Comprehensive Constant Testing:**  The `test_language_constants` now thoroughly checks all defined constants.

4. **Type Checking:** `test_language_constant_types` checks that each constant is indeed a string, adding a vital validation step.

5. **Attribute Checking:** `test_no_other_attributes` checks that no unexpected attributes were introduced in the `Language` class which is very good defensive programming practice.

6. **Case Sensitivity Test:** `test_attribute_case_sensitivity` now demonstrates proper usage of `pytest.raises` to check for errors in case-insensitive access.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_languages.py`).
2.  **Install pytest:** If you haven't already, install `pytest` using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_languages.py
    ```

This improved solution addresses the potential import error, provides more thorough testing of the language constants, and includes comprehensive checks for data integrity.  Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/models/languages.py"` with the actual path to your file if it's different. Also, consider adding a `__init__.py` file to your `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/models/` folder if it doesn't already exist.
