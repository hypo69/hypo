How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets` for creating Jupyter widgets to interact with and manage AliExpress campaigns. It allows users to select campaigns, categories, languages, initialize campaign editors, save campaigns, show products, and open associated Google spreadsheets. The code utilizes the `ipywidgets` library for creating interactive elements in Jupyter notebooks.  The class dynamically updates the category selection dropdown based on the chosen campaign.  It also includes error handling and logging for robust operation.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries**: The code imports libraries like `ipywidgets`, `IPython.display`, `webbrowser`, and custom modules (`gs`, `AliCampaignEditor`, `locales`, `pprint`, `get_directory_names`, `logger`) for handling I/O operations, displaying elements, interacting with the web, and handling data.

2. **Define the `JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets` class**: This class encapsulates the widgets and their associated functionality.

3. **Initialize widgets**: Dropdown widgets for campaign names, categories, and languages are created. Buttons for initializing, saving, displaying products, and opening spreadsheets are also defined.

4. **Set up callbacks**:  Functions like `setup_callbacks` establish event handlers (e.g., `on_campaign_name_change`) that respond to user interactions with the widgets.  These functions trigger actions such as updating the category dropdown, initializing the `AliCampaignEditor`, or invoking the `save_campaign` function, etc.

5. **Initialize `AliCampaignEditor`**: The `initialize_campaign_editor` function uses the selected campaign name and language to instantiate an `AliCampaignEditor` object. This object is assumed to handle the underlying logic for interacting with the AliExpress campaign data.

6. **Update Category Dropdown**: `update_category_dropdown` is used to reflect the available categories for the chosen campaign.

7. **Handle User Interactions**: Functions like `on_campaign_name_change`, `on_category_change`, `on_language_change` respond to widget selections, re-initializing the campaign editor with new parameters.

8. **Save Campaign**: The `save_campaign` function utilizes the `AliCampaignEditor` to save the campaign's details.

9. **Display Products**: `show_products` displays products in the chosen category from the Google Sheet (using the `AliCampaignEditor`).

10. **Open Spreadsheet**: `open_spreadsheet` opens the corresponding Google Sheet in a web browser using the `AliCampaignEditor`'s spreadsheet ID.

11. **Display Widgets**: The `display_widgets` method uses `IPython.display` to display all the created widgets in a Jupyter notebook.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign.ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets import JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets

    # Create an instance of the widget class
    editor_widgets = JupyterCampaignEditorWidgets()

    # Display the widgets in the Jupyter Notebook
    editor_widgets.display_widgets()
