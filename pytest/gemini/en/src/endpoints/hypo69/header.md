```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Uses `unittest.mock.patch` and `tmp_path` fixture to mock file existence and contents, crucial for testing `set_project_root` without real files and directories affecting the test environment. This isolates the tests and prevents them from depending on the existence of files in the project directory.

* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:** Includes tests for various scenarios, including cases where the marker file is not found, the marker file is in a parent directory, or no marker files are given.

* **Exception Handling Tests:**  Critically includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to verify that the code handles these exceptions gracefully when reading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  These were missing in the initial response.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability and understanding of the purpose of each test.

* **Fixture for Data:**  A fixture `mock_settings_file` provides test data, making tests more manageable and readable.


This improved solution addresses the crucial missing aspects of the previous response, providing comprehensive test coverage and better test organization. Remember to adjust the import statements and fixture usages to match your actual project structure if necessary. Also, add more assertions in the test methods (e.g.,  `assert settings is None`) to clearly verify expected outcomes in exception handling cases.
