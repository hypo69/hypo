**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **No Dummy Functions:** The original provided code was empty.  I've added example test functions (`test_mode_is_dev`, `test_check_login_...`) to demonStarte how to write tests for possible functions. *Crucially, these are only examples* - replace them with the tests necessary for the *actual* functions in your `login.py` file.  

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Crucially, I've shown how to use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions that your functions might raise (e.g., `ValueError` for missing credentials).

3. **Clear Assertions:** The assertions (`assert`) now check for the *expected* outcomes.  The previous example assertions were incomplete.

4. **Example `login.check_login` function:** I've created *example* test functions. You must replace these with tests for the *actual* functions present in your `login.py` file.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Remove the example test functions and replace them with tests for your actual `login.py` functions.
2. **Implement the actual functions:** Create the functions (`check_login`, or whatever they are) in your `login.py` file that the tests are intended to test.
3. **Run the tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests in your terminal.  For example:

```bash
pytest
```


This improved solution provides a robust template for writing `pytest` tests, focusing on exception handling and clear assertions.  Remember to replace the placeholder functions and assertions with the specifics of your `login.py` file's code.
