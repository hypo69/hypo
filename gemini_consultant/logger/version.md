```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling and Logging:** The crucial addition of `print("Warning: settings.json not found or invalid. Using defaults.")` provides feedback to the user if `settings.json` is missing or corrupt. This is vital for debugging and understanding potential issues.  Logging to a file is even better.
* **Typo Correction:** Fixed the typo in `__copyright__` to `copyright`.
* **Variable type hints (PEP 484):**  Using type hints (`__version__: str = ...`) makes the code more readable and allows static analysis tools to catch potential type errors.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Added blank lines and formatting for better readability according to the PEP 8 style guide.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

**How to use:**

In your other Python code, you can import and use these variables:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append(r"C:\Users\user\Documents\repos\hypotez\src")  # Adjust path as needed

import logger.version

print(logger.version.__project_name__)
print(logger.version.__version__)
```

This revised code is more robust, informative, and adheres to best practices. Remember to replace placeholder values in `settings.json` with your actual project data. Using `sys.path.append(...)` allows you to correctly import the module from the specified directory. This is critical to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`  if the `logger` folder is not in the Python search path. Adjust the path if your project structure is different. Always check the full path to confirm the correct location.
