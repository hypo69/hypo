**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` and prints an informative error message.  Critically, it's important to log errors to a file (e.g., a log.txt) instead of just printing to the console in a production environment. This makes debugging easier and provides a record of failures.  The `e` variable now properly holds the exception information.

* **Docstring Placeholder:**  `__doc__` and `__details__` are now initialized to empty strings, but you should replace these with proper docstrings that describe the module's purpose and content.

* **`__copyright__` Corrected Typo:** The typo "copyrihgnt" was corrected to "copyright".

* **Explicit Type Hinting:** Although not strictly necessary for this example, using `__version__: str = ...` improves readability.  Though the code was implicitly correct, this is good practice.

* **Style:** Minor improvements in spacing and variable naming conventions.


**How to use this file:**

This file is designed to be imported into other modules to retrieve the version information of your `hypotez` project.  The information should be stored in `settings.json` for customization.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez Project",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```

By using this improved `version.py`, your code will be more robust and easier to maintain, especially in a production environment.  Proper error handling and docstrings are crucial elements of good software engineering practice. Remember to include a logger to record any exceptions in a production environment.
