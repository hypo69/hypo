## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`, sets the project root directory and loads project settings.  It's crucial for relative imports and accessing project-specific information.

**Core Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root(marker_files=...)`:** This function locates the project root directory.  It starts from the current script's location and searches up the directory tree until it finds a directory containing any of the specified `marker_files`.  These marker files, defaults to `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git`, are common project indicators.

   - **`marker_files`:**  A tuple of filenames or directory names to search for.  This allows customization if your project uses different markers.
   - **Returns:** A `Path` object representing the root directory.  If no matching directory is found, it returns the directory of the current script.  Critically, it also adds the root directory to `sys.path`, ensuring correct import behavior.

2. **Project Settings Loading:** The script loads settings from `src/settings.json`.  It tries to open this file, load the JSON content into the `settings` dictionary, and handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions if the file doesn't exist or is invalid JSON.

3. **Project Documentation Loading:** The script attempts to load project documentation from `src/README.MD` and stores it in the `doc_str` variable.  Again, it handles potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions gracefully.

4. **Project Metadata:**  It extracts key project metadata (name, version, author, copyright, etc.) from the loaded `settings` (or defaults if not found).  These values are assigned to variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc., following Python's naming convention for metadata.


**How to Use:**

This file is intended to be imported *into other files within the project*.  You don't need to call `set_project_root` directly within your own scripts, because it's done once at the top of `header.py` and `__root__` is then readily available.


**Example Usage (in another module):**

```python
from logger import gs  # Assume gs is imported from header.py
print(gs.path.root) # Access project root path
print(__project_name__) # Access project name from settings
print(__version__) # Access project version from settings
```

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading settings and documentation, preventing the script from crashing.
- **Clear Documentation:**  Provides comprehensive explanations of the purpose and functionality of the functions and variables.
- **Explicit Return Value:** `set_project_root` returns the `Path` to the root directory, enabling direct use in other modules.


**Potential Improvements:**

- **Configuration flexibility:** Consider using a more sophisticated configuration management library (e.g., `configparser`) if the settings become more complex.
- **More robust error handling:**  You might log errors more explicitly using a logging framework to capture and log errors gracefully.
- **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints is excellent; consider using a stricter type hinting style, especially in the marker file argument to `set_project_root`.
