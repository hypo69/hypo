**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Docstring:** Added a comprehensive docstring to the module explaining its purpose, functionality (AI suppliers), and the `MODE` constant.  This is crucial for documentation and understanding the module's role.  The docstring now clearly explains the module's overall purpose and function.

* **Clarity and Structure:**  Separated the `MODE` constant's description into a separate docstring line below the declaration, making it clear and easily understandable.

* **Import Comments:** Comments are added before each import statement explaining *why* those libraries are imported.

* **Conciseness:** Removed redundant documentation for the `MODE` constant, consolidating it into a clear and concise explanation within the docstring.

* **Clarity on AI Suppliers:** The comment `""" AI Suppliers """` is now integrated into the docstring and correctly describes that this module imports classes related to AI suppliers, rather than being a separate declaration.

* **Consistent Style:** The code is formatted using standard Python conventions, which is crucial for maintainability and readability by other developers.


**How to Use This Improved Documentation:**

This improved docstring is now much more useful and informative.  When you import this module in another file, you can access its documentation using tools like `help(hypotez.src.ai.gemini)` in a Python interpreter or using documentation generators that read docstrings.  This will provide a clear explanation of the module's functionality, the purpose of `MODE`, and a description of the imported classes.


**Example of Using `help()`:**

If you run `help(hypotez.src.ai.gemini)` in a Python interpreter, you would see this improved documentation in the output, including the explanations within the module docstring. This greatly improves the usability and readability of the codebase. Remember that this assumes you have correctly imported and initialized the `hypotez` package and its submodules.
