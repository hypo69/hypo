# `credentials.py` Module

The `credentials.py` module manages sensitive configuration settings and credentials essential for the `hypotez` application. It centralizes the handling of paths, passwords, logins, and API keys, ensuring secure and consistent access throughout the project.

## Overview

The `ProjectSettings` class, implemented as a singleton using the `SingletonMeta` metaclass, manages and stores all critical project settings and credentials.  This ensures that only one instance of the class exists, maintaining consistency across the application.

## Features

1. **Singleton Pattern:** The `SingletonMeta` metaclass enforces the singleton pattern, guaranteeing a single instance of `ProjectSettings` is available throughout the application.

2. **Configuration Management:** The `ProjectSettings` class defines critical project file paths and directories using `Path` objects, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

3. **Secure Credentials Storage:**  Loads sensitive information, including API keys, passwords, and other credentials, from a KeePass database (`src/settings/db.kdbx`).  This includes credentials for various services: Aliexpress, OpenAI, Telegram, Discord, Prestashop, SMTP, Facebook, translation services, and Google APIs (gAPIs).

4. **Path Definitions:** Manages paths for key project directories: root, source (`src`), binary (`bin`), log, temporary (`tmp`), cookie, and external data.

5. **Initialization and Loading:**
   - The `__init__` method initializes the settings and loads credentials from the KeePass database via the `_load_credentials()` method.
   - Includes robust retry logic (`_open_kp()`) to handle potential issues with opening the KeePass database.

6. **Credential Loading Methods:** Provides methods to load credentials for specific services:
   - `_load_*_credentials()`:  Handles loading credentials for Aliexpress, OpenAI, Discord, Telegram, Prestashop, SMTP, Facebook, translations, and gAPIs.  Credentials are stored within the `credentials` attribute of `ProjectSettings` in a structured way (e.g., `gs.credentials.aliexpress`).  The `SimpleNamespace` object is used for easier access.


## Usage with `gs` (Global Settings)

To access credentials in your project, use the global `gs` object from your application's `__init__.py` file:

```python
from __init__ import gs

# Access Aliexpress API credentials
aliexpress_api_key = gs.credentials.aliexpress.api_key
```

## Notes

- **KeePass Database:** Credentials are stored in a KeePass database located at `src/settings/db.kdbx`.  You must provide the KeePass master password to access the database.

- **Cross-OS Compatibility:** Paths are handled using `Path` objects from a library like `pathlib` for consistency across operating systems.

- **Customization:** The root directory name (`hypotez`) is hardcoded.  Consider adding functionality to configure the root directory name from a configuration file or command-line argument.


- **Error Handling:** Includes error handling (`try...except` blocks) to gracefully manage potential issues during KeePass database access and credential loading.

## Installation

Ensure the `pykeepass` library is installed:

```bash
pip install pykeepass
```


## Example Usage

```python
# Import the settings
from __init__ import gs

# Get the path to the log directory
log_path = gs.path.log

# Get the API key for Aliexpress
aliexpress_api_key = gs.credentials.aliexpress.api_key
```

## Important Considerations

- **Security:**  The KeePass database is crucial for security.  Ensure it's protected and backed up.  Never hardcode passwords or sensitive information directly into your code.

- **Error Handling:** The code now includes better error handling, logging exceptions properly, and providing informative error messages to the developer.

- **Clearer Structure:**  The module structure is improved, making it easier to understand the purpose of each method and variable.


## Project Structure (Example)

```
project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── settings/
│   │   ├── credentials.py
│   │   ├── settings.py  # (If you have global settings)
│   │   └── db.kdbx
│   ├── utils/
│   └── logger.py
└── main.py
```


This revised README provides a more comprehensive and user-friendly description of the `credentials.py` module, highlighting security and best practices. Remember to replace placeholders like `__root__` with the actual path to the project root if necessary.
