**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `logger` and `gs` modules. This isolates the tests and prevents them from interacting with the actual external dependencies.  This is essential for reliable testing.
* **Error Handling:**  The test `test_run_crawler_empty_urls` now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected `TypeError` if an empty list is passed.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **`Path` handling:**  The `Path` objects are now used correctly within the tests for robust file path handling.
* **`test_run_full_cycle`:**  A test that combines `setup_crawler`, `run_crawler`, `export_data`, `get_data` and checks expected results. This is a more complete test.
* **`test_invalid_url`:** Added a test case for an invalid URL.  This is important for robustness.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and meaningful, making the tests easier to read and understand.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings are added to explain the purpose and logic of each test function.
* **pytest.mark.asyncio:** Ensures the tests run in an event loop, crucial for asynchronous code.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Place the test code in a file named `test_crawlee_python.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `crawlee_python.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_crawlee_python.py`


This significantly improved test suite covers a wider range of scenarios, handles potential errors, and provides more reliable testing for your `crawlee_python` code. Remember to adapt the temporary file path in the `mock_gs` fixture to a valid directory on your system. Also, install the necessary libraries for the project.
