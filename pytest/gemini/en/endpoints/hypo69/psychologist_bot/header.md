**Explanation and Improvements:**

- **Mocking:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create mock `settings.json` and `README.MD` files for testing. This eliminates the need to have those files in the project directory, allowing more isolated tests.
- **Error Handling:** Added tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to ensure the code handles invalid input correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The tests now include cases where the marker files are in subdirectories, are not present at all, or the files are not reachable.
- **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are made more specific, directly verifying that `__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc. are set to the expected values.
- **Important `sys.path` Modification:** The crucial step of adding the temporary path to `sys.path` was added within the fixture to enable the import statement to correctly locate the mocked data during testing.
- **Removed Redundant Lines**: Removed commented lines that were not necessary or had become obsolete due to the changes.
- **Docstrings:** Added better docstrings to explain the purpose of the tests.
- **`tmp_path`:** Employs `tmp_path` from `pytest` for temporary directory creation, preventing conflicts between tests.

This revised solution is much more robust and thoroughly tests the `get_project_root` function and its subsequent usage in handling the project variables, making it less susceptible to external factors and more reliable in uncovering potential issues. Remember to install the necessary packages (`pytest`, `packaging`, `pathlib`) if you haven't already.  Use `pip install pytest packaging` in your terminal to install these packages.
