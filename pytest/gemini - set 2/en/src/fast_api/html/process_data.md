```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.fast_api.html import process_data

# Replace with actual import if 'main' exists in a different module.
# from .main import process_dataa  # If process_dataa is in a different file

def test_process_data_valid_input():
    """Tests process_data with valid input (if available)."""

    # process_data expects as input!
    valid_input = {'some': 'data'}
    # Add an assertion only if the function returns something.
    # For example, if process_data returns a value.
    # result = process_data(valid_input)
    # assert result == expected_output
    pass  # Replace with actual assertion if applicable

    """Tests process_data with empty input."""
    empty_input = {}
    # You might expect an exception or a specific output for empty input.
    # Add the appropriate assertion, using pytest.raises if expected.
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
        process_data(empty_input)
    assert "expected str, got NoneType" in str(excinfo.value)
    #Or for example:
    # assert process_data(empty_input) == "Empty Input" # if this is the expected behavior


def test_process_data_invalid_input_type():
    """Tests process_data with incorrect input type."""
    invalid_input = 123  # Example incorrect input type
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:

    # or whatever the appropriate error message is


def test_process_data_missing_key():
    """Tests process_data with missing key in input."""
    # Example input with a missing key. Replace with your format.
    missing_key_input = {'some': 'data', 'other_key': 'data2'}
    # Replace with the actual function name if different from process_data
    with pytest.raises(KeyError) as excinfo:
        process_data(missing_key_input)
    assert "some_key" in str(excinfo.value)  # Replace with actual KeyError.


#   Important Considerations for Testing:

#  -  If process_data is actually calling another function to process the input,
#     you'll need to test that other function as well (unit testing).


# Example usage for a function that takes a string input (replace with actual code):
def test_process_data_with_string_input():
    """Tests process_data with a string input."""
    string_input = "some_string"
    # Add your assertion here based on what process_data does with string input.
    # Example using pytest.raises if expecting an exception.
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        process_data(string_input)
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  This line is essential for running the tests with pytest.

2. **Import `process_data`:** You need to import the function you're testing. Make sure the path to `process_data` is correct.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  This is the correct way to test for expected exceptions in `pytest`.  Crucially, this now *checks the error message*. This helps you catch and validate exceptions in a more robust manner.

4. **Specific Error Messages:** The tests now check for *specific* error messages, not just that an exception was raised. This is *vital* for debugging and understanding the failure reasons.

5. **Placeholder Assertions:** The `pass` statements in `test_process_data_valid_input` are placeholders. You must replace them with actual assertions based on what the function `process_data` is supposed to do and return for valid input.

6. **Clear Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

7. **Comprehensive Input Types:** The example tests now cover empty input, incorrect input types (e.g., integers instead of strings), and missing keys in the input dictionary.  You should modify these based on the actual input and expected behavior of `process_data`.

8. **Missing `main` import:** The code now explicitly indicates the need for a correct `main` import statement, addressing the critical missing import.

**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., as `test_process_data.py`) in the same directory as your `process_data.py` file.
2. Run `pytest test_process_data.py` in your terminal.

**Before running the tests, you MUST:**

* **Replace the placeholders (`pass`, example inputs, error messages) with the actual behavior of your `process_data` function.** This includes understanding what `process_data` expects as input and what it's supposed to return for different scenarios.
* **Ensure `process_data.py` is correctly imported and accessible.**  The imports may need to change if `process_data` isn't in the same module.
* **Understand the specific exception types (`TypeError`, `KeyError`) and their messages that `process_data` raises.**

Once you fill in the details and correct the imports, these tests will cover the function's various behaviors. Remember to cover all the expected input types and error conditions for `process_data`.
