**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Added `from unittest.mock import patch` to enable mocking.  Crucially, imports for the actual classes (Graber, Context, Driver, logger) are included as well as `pytest`.


2. **Mocking:** `@pytest.fixture` `driver_mock` now correctly mocks the `Driver` class.  This is essential because `Graber` interacts with the `Driver`'s methods. Mocking `logger` is also important in real tests.


3. **Specific Tests:** The provided example tests the `__init__` method of the `Graber` class, which is important. The `test_graber_method_no_error` example is a placeholder and needs to be adapted.  Crucially, this placeholder test now uses `@patch` to mock the logger, allowing us to verify logging behavior without actually interacting with a real logger.


4. **Edge Case & Exception Handling:**  The example `test_graber_method_no_error` is a placeholder. You need to write tests that verify how the Graber class handles different input types, and any exceptions it might raise. The existing `@close_pop_up` has no actual functionality (only a commented-out stub). Therefore, tests should NOT involve calling it.


5. **Clearer Structure:**  The example test functions now have clear docstrings that explain the purpose of each test.


6. **Missing `my_method`:** The `test_graber_method_no_error` test has a `my_method` placeholder. **Replace `my_method` with the actual method from `graber.py` you want to test.**  Adapt the assertions to the specific logic of the method you're testing.


**How to adapt the tests further:**

- **Identify methods:** Determine all functions and methods in the `Graber` class and `graber.py` file that you need to test.
- **Mock required dependencies:**  If methods use `Context.driver`, mock them in the fixture.
- **Use `pytest.raises`:** For tests that expect specific exceptions, use `pytest.raises`.
- **Input values:** Prepare various test input values (valid, invalid, edge cases) to thoroughly test the methods.
- **Assertions:** Write specific assertions about the results (e.g., returned values, exceptions raised, logger messages).
- **Remove Placeholder:** Remove the placeholder `test_graber_method_no_error` test when you have replaced it with tests for real methods.  Remove the commented-out test with `@close_pop_up` unless it's a method of the class that is now in use.


**Example using pytest.raises (for exception handling):**


```python
import pytest
@pytest.fixture
def ...  # (your fixtures remain the same)


@pytest.mark.parametrize("invalid_input", [ ... ]) # Parameterize for multiple invalid inputs.
def test_graber_method_invalid_input(graber, invalid_input, driver_mock):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        graber.my_method(invalid_input)
    assert "Expected error message" in str(excinfo.value)
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `my_method`, `invalid_input`, and expected error messages with the actual details from your code.  This significantly improved solution provides a strong foundation for testing your Graber class.
