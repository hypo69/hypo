How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that locates the root directory of a project.  It then initializes several variables, including `__root__`, `settings`, `doc_str`, and various project metadata like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__`.  These variables are populated from a `settings.json` file within the project and a `README.MD` file.  Crucially, it modifies Python's `sys.path` to include the project root, ensuring correct module imports.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from the `packaging` library (for version handling), and `Path` from `pathlib`.
2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker files as input.
3. **Locate project root:** It starts from the current file's directory and traverses up the directory tree until it finds a directory containing at least one of the specified marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
4. **Append root to sys.path:** The identified root directory is added to the `sys.path` list. This is critical for importing modules from other parts of the project.
5. **Return project root path:** The function returns the determined project root path, which is saved into `__root__`.
6. **Get settings from settings.json:**  It attempts to read the `settings.json` file within the project root to load project settings.
7. **Get documentation from README.MD:** It tries to read the `README.MD` file to load the project documentation.
8. **Load project metadata:** Variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, and others are populated from the settings loaded from `settings.json` or default values are used if the file is missing or if the necessary fields are not available in the JSON file.
9. **Set __root__ variable:**  It assigns the result of `set_project_root` to `__root__`, making the project root available for future use in the script.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from hypotez.src.webdriver.header import set_project_root, __root__, __project_name__, __version__

    # Get the project root path
    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")

    # Print project name and version
    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Version: {__version__}")

    # Example usage showing access to root path and other metadata
    # This is critical to demonstrate the practical application.
    readme_path = os.path.join(str(project_root), "src", "README.MD")
    if os.path.exists(readme_path):
        with open(readme_path, 'r') as file:
            readme_content = file.read()
            print(readme_content[:100])  # Show the first 100 chars of README.
    else:
        print("README.MD not found")
