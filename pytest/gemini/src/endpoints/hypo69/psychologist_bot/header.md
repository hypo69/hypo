**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests and prevents side effects. `mock_root_dir` fixture is critical.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test names for better readability and understanding.
* **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where no marker files are found and where marker files are in a parent directory. This covers more scenarios.
* **Exception Handling:** Included tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, using `pytest.raises` for more robust testing.
* **Robustness:** Added tests to ensure that `set_project_root` doesn't raise an error when no marker files are provided.
* **Valid Input Tests:** Added a test (`test_set_project_root_valid_path`) to confirm the function's behavior with a valid project root.
* **Type Handling:**  Added a test (`test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_files_type`) to demonStarte correct error handling when the marker_files parameter is not a tuple.
* **File Not Found Test:** Added a test `test_set_project_root_file_not_found` to show how to test when the marker file does not exist.
* **sys.path:** Corrected logic to test `sys.path` addition.
* **Monkeypatching:** Using `monkeypatch` in `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` ensures that the `__file__` attribute is correctly set for the testing environment.
* **Empty Tuple Test:**  A test is included (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files_and_sys_path`) to ensure that an empty tuple `marker_files` does not cause errors. This checks for robustness with possible input variations.

This revised solution provides a more comprehensive set of tests that cover a wider range of scenarios, ensuring the `set_project_root` function behaves correctly in different situations. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`.  Run `pip install pytest packaging` before running these tests.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure the `hypotez/src/endpoints/hypo69/psychologist_bot/header.py` code is in your project's structure, or adjust the imports in `test_header.py`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`
