This Python code generates affiliate links for products from AliExpress.  Here's a usage guide:

**File:** `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/_examples/affiliated_products_generator.py`

**Purpose:** Generates affiliate links for AliExpress products, saving images and optionally videos locally.


**How to Use:**

1. **Installation:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.  The code likely relies on specific libraries used by the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class.  If this class doesn't already exist, it needs to be defined.  Without knowing the specific class implementation, I can't provide detailed installation instructions.  You need to address any dependencies required by the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class.

2. **Define Parameters:**

   ```python
   campaign_name = "summer_sale_2024"
   campaign_category = "electronics"  # Optional, can be None
   language = "EN"
   currency = "USD"
   ```

   These variables define the context for affiliate links.  `campaign_name` helps organize your campaign data, and `campaign_category` helps target advertising.  `language` and `currency` are crucial for localization and pricing.

3. **Product Inputs:**

   ```python
   prod_urls = [
       '123',
       'https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123.html',
       '456',
       'https://www.aliexpress.com/item/456.html',
   ]
   ```

   Provide a list of product URLs or IDs.  The script expects the input to be either product IDs (e.g., '123') or complete product URLs (e.g., `https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123.html`).

4. **Instantiate `AliAffiliatedProducts`:**

   ```python
   parser = AliAffiliatedProducts(
       campaign_name,
       campaign_category,
       language,
       currency
   )
   ```

   This creates an object responsible for handling affiliate link generation.

5. **Process Products:**

   ```python
   products = parser.process_affiliate_products(prod_urls)
   ```

   This crucial function does the work. It takes the list of product URLs/IDs, fetches the affiliate link data, potentially downloads images/videos, and returns a list of `Product` objects.  The `Product` object should have attributes like `product_id`, `promotion_link`, `local_saved_image`, and `local_saved_video`.  Crucially, the `parser.process_affiliate_products` function should handle potential errors (e.g., invalid product IDs, network issues) gracefully.

6. **Check and Display Results:**

   ```python
   if products:
       # ... (print product details)
   else:
       print("Failed to retrieve affiliate products.")
   ```

   The code iterates through the returned `products` list and prints details for each, including the affiliate link and any saved local files.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code has basic error handling (checking for an empty `products` list).  Robust error handling, especially for network issues or invalid input, should be implemented within the `process_affiliate_products` method to make the script more reliable.
* **`AliAffiliatedProducts` Class:** The provided code snippet assumes an `AliAffiliatedProducts` class exists. You need to define this class (or modify/use an existing one) that handles the actual data fetching and affiliate link generation from AliExpress.
* **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of AliExpress's API or website's rate limits when fetching data.  Implement delays or error handling to avoid getting blocked.
* **Data Persistence:** If you need to save the results persistently, consider writing the `products` list to a file or database.
* **Security:** If you are using an API key or any sensitive data, handle it securely.

**Example `Product` class (Illustrative):**

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, product_id, promotion_link, local_saved_image=None, local_saved_video=None):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.promotion_link = promotion_link
        self.local_saved_image = local_saved_image
        self.local_saved_video = local_saved_video
```


This comprehensive guide provides a much more actionable understanding of how to use the code. Remember to fill in the implementation details of the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class and necessary dependencies. Remember to handle potential errors, especially within the `process_affiliate_products` method.
