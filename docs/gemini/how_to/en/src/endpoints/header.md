How to use the `hypotez/src/endpoints/header.py` file

This file is a foundational module for the `hypotez` project, setting up essential variables and paths.  It's crucial for initializing the project environment and accessing important configuration information.

**Core Functionality:**

1. **Project Root Determination:**
   - The `set_project_root` function is the cornerstone of the file. It dynamically locates the project's root directory.
   - It starts from the location of the `header.py` file itself and searches upward through parent directories.
   - It looks for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) to determine the true root.
   - If found, the root directory is added to Python's `sys.path` for easier import access.

2. **Configuration Loading:**
   - The file loads project settings from a JSON file named `settings.json` located within the project's `src` directory.
   - Error handling (`try...except`) gracefully manages cases where the `settings.json` file is missing or contains invalid JSON.  This is crucial for robust error management.


3. **Documentation Loading:**
   - The script attempts to read documentation from a `README.MD` file located in the `src` directory.
   - Similar error handling ensures smooth operation if `README.MD` is missing or inaccessible.


4. **Variable Initialization:**
   - Several variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.) are initialized based on the loaded settings (or default values if settings are missing or invalid).


**Usage Guide:**

1. **Import the Header:**
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.endpoints.header import __project_name__, __version__ 
   ```

2. **Accessing Variables:**
   ```python
   print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
   print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")
   print(f"Project Documentation: {__doc__}")
   ```

**Key Considerations:**

* **`gs` Module:** The code relies on a `gs` module.  Ensure this module is properly installed and its functions (likely file path manipulation) are available.

* **Error Handling:** The inclusion of `try...except` blocks makes the code more robust. Always check for potential `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` during configuration loading.

* **Project Structure:**  The `settings.json` and `README.MD` files should be located in the expected `src` directory within your project.

* **`sys.path` Modification:** Be aware that appending to `sys.path` can affect how Python imports modules, so be careful and manage your project structure properly.

* **Versioning:** The use of `packaging.version` correctly handles version strings, ensuring reliable comparisons and updates.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername"
}
```


This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how to use the `header.py` file to initialize your `hypotez` project and access its configuration and documentation. Remember to adapt the examples to your specific requirements.
