**Changes Made**

- Added missing `import` statement for `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added missing `import` statement for `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` throughout the code as per the requirements.
- Improved error handling by using `logger.error` for better logging of errors during file loading. Added context in the error messages.
- Renamed `__root__` to `project_root` for better clarity.
- Replaced inline comments with RST style docstrings for all functions and variables.
- Improved variable naming consistency.
- Improved code readability and style consistency.
- Added more descriptive error handling and fixed potential `None` errors. Added checks for `settings` to prevent issues when `settings` is `None`.
- Added more specific error messages for better debugging.
