# Changes Made

- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` for JSON handling.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) to the class, init method, and other methods to improve code readability.
- Replaced vague comments with more specific terms.
- Removed unnecessary comments and variable declarations.
- Corrected import statements to match expected module names and locations.
- Improved variable names and function parameters to increase clarity.
