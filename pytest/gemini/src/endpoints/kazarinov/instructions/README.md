    return f"Hello, {name}!"

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder:** The code now includes placeholder functions (`greet`, `add_numbers`) and their docstrings.  Crucially, you MUST replace this with the actual functions from your `hypotez` code.

2. **Fixtures:** Fixtures are used to provide test data (e.g., `sample_names`, `sample_numbers`). This makes the tests more organized and reusable.

3. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover:
   - Valid inputs (various types).
   - Invalid inputs (non-string for `greet`, non-numeric for `add_numbers`).
   - Edge cases (zero input, negative numbers, floats for `add_numbers`).
   - Exception handling using `pytest.raises`.


4. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

5. **Descriptive Assertions:** Assertions are written to be easy to understand, e.g., `assert result == x + y`.

6. **Error Message Validation:**  The test now checks the *actual* error message thrown by `greet` and `add_numbers`.  This is crucial for debugging.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the example functions with the actual functions from your `hypotez` code.
2. **Run Tests:**  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_instructions.py`). Then, run `pytest test_instructions.py` from your terminal.


This revised example demonstrates a more robust and thorough approach to writing `pytest` tests, ready for integration with your actual code. Remember to adapt the tests to the specifics of your code. Remember to adapt the tests based on the function signatures and expected behavior of the actual functions.  Add or modify test cases as needed.
