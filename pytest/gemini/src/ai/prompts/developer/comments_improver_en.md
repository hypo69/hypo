**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** Imports the `comments_improver_en` module. **Crucially, replace `comments_improver_en` with the actual name of your Python file.**

2. **Example Function:**  I've created a placeholder `improve_comment` function.  **Replace this with your actual code.**

3. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover:
   - Valid input (different types of strings).
   - Empty string (ValueError).
   - Uppercase, lowercase, and mixed-case strings.
   - Numbers and symbols.

4. **`pytest.raises`:**  Uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected `ValueError` when an empty string is provided.  This is important for exception handling.

5. **Clear Test Names:** Function names clearly describe the test case.

6. **Docstrings:** Docstrings explain the purpose of each test.

7. **Isolated Tests:** Each test is independent, ensuring that failures don't propagate.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_comments_improver.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_comments_improver.py`


**Important:** The provided code structure assumes you have a `comments_improver_en.py` file containing the function you want to test.  Replace the placeholder function and filename with the correct ones from your project. Remember to adapt the test cases to the actual functions and classes you want to test.
