**Explanation of Changes:**

The original input was purely markdown, not Python code. Therefore, the "Improved Code" section refactors the markdown content for better structure and readability using reStructuredText syntax.  No Python code was provided in the input, so no code modifications were made. The `FULL Code` section now also shows the improved markdown as the entire content.
