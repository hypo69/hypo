```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking the Logger:** The original code used a `logger`.  Testing functions that use external calls like logging needs mocking. The `pytest.MonkeyPatch()` approach is used for this. This isolates the test from actual logging and avoids side effects.


2. **Clearer Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly check for the expected `TypeError` when the input is not a string, demonstrating a better understanding of the function's potential errors. This makes the tests more robust.  More tests are added to cover different invalid input cases


3. **Comprehensive Input Validation:** More cases with different invalid inputs are added to cover a wider range of error conditions, which helps create a more thorough test suite.

4. **pytest.raises for Exceptions:** `pytest.raises` is now correctly used to test exception handling, making the tests more robust and preventing false positives.

5. **Descriptive Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate the purpose of each test case.

6. **No unnecessary fixtures:** The code uses a minimal amount of fixture data (no fixtures necessary for these simple tests).

7. **Thoroughness:** The tests cover various invalid input conditions.

**How to Run:**

Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_login.py`).  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Run the tests from your terminal using:

```bash
pytest test_login.py
```


This improved test suite provides better coverage, handling potential errors effectively, and is a more comprehensive set of tests for the `login` function. Remember to adapt the error messages in the `assert` statements to reflect the specific error messages raised by the function if necessary. Remember to replace placeholders like `your_supplier_data` with actual data from your code.
