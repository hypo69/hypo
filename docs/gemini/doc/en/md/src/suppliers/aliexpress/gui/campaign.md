# hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui/campaign.py

## Overview

This module provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing AliExpress campaigns. It utilizes PyQt6 for creating the window and allows users to open JSON files containing campaign data, modify the data in the UI, and prepare the campaign.  The `CampaignEditor` class handles the majority of the UI interaction.


## Classes

### `CampaignEditor`

**Description**: The `CampaignEditor` class is the main class for the campaign editor GUI.  It manages the UI elements, loading campaign data from JSON, and allowing modification and preparation of the campaign.

**Methods**

#### `__init__(self, parent=None, main_app=None)`

**Description**: Initializes the `CampaignEditor` widget.

**Parameters**
- `parent` (Optional[QWidget], optional): The parent widget. Defaults to None.
- `main_app` (Optional[MainApp], optional): The main application instance. Defaults to None.


**Raises**
- `TypeError`: If any of the input arguments are of an invalid type.



#### `setup_ui(self)`

**Description**: Sets up the user interface for the `CampaignEditor` widget.

**Raises**
- `Exception`: Any exception during UI setup.

#### `setup_connections(self)`

**Description**: Establishes signal-slot connections for the UI elements.


**Raises**
- `Exception`: If a signal-slot connection fails.

#### `open_file(self)`

**Description**: Opens a file dialog to select a JSON file containing campaign data.  Loads the file if selected.

**Raises**
- `Exception`: If there's an issue opening the file dialog or loading the file.


#### `load_file(self, campaign_file)`

**Description**: Loads a JSON file containing campaign data into the editor.  Initializes the display of campaign information within the editor window.

**Parameters**
- `campaign_file` (str): The path to the JSON file.


**Raises**
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the specified `campaign_file` does not exist.
- `json.JSONDecodeError`: If the JSON file is not valid JSON.
- `Exception`: If any other error occurs during loading.


#### `create_widgets(self, data)`

**Description**: Creates UI widgets (e.g., QLineEdit) for displaying and editing campaign data based on the provided `data` (presumably loaded from the JSON file).

**Parameters**
- `data` (SimpleNamespace): An object containing the loaded campaign data.


**Raises**
- `Exception`: If there is an error creating the widgets.


#### `prepare_campaign(self)`

**Description**: Asynchronously prepares the campaign according to the loaded data.  This method uses a background process for campaign preparation.

**Raises**
- `Exception`: If any error occurs during campaign preparation.


## Functions

This module does not include any additional functions beyond the methods in the `CampaignEditor` class.


## Data Structures

This module uses `SimpleNamespace` to represent the loaded campaign data.


## Modules

- `header`: (assumed, but not defined in the code) Likely contains other utility functions or modules.
- `asyncio`: Python's asynchronous programming library.
- `sys`: Python's system module.
- `pathlib`: Python's module for path manipulation.
- `types`: Python's built-in module for types.
- `PyQt6`: Python's GUI framework used for this application.
- `qasync`: (assumed) Library for asynchronous operations within PyQt6.
- `src.utils`: (assumed) Likely contains utility functions for JSON handling.
- `src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign`: (assumed) Module containing the `AliCampaignEditor` class to prepare the campaign.
- `styles`: Module handling styling for UI components (e.g., `set_fixed_size`).


## Usage

Users can use the `CampaignEditor` to open a JSON file containing campaign data, modify the displayed data, and prepare the campaign. The preparation functionality is handled asynchronously by another class likely within the `src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign` module.


## Error Handling

The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during file loading and campaign preparation.  It also uses `QtWidgets.QMessageBox.critical()` to show informative error messages to the user. This practice is crucial for a robust and user-friendly application.
