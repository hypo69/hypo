# Changes Made

*   Added imports for `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format for all functions and the module.
*   Implemented logging using `logger.info` and `logger.error` for improved error handling.  Avoided unnecessary try-except blocks.
*   Added `exc_info=True` to `logger.error` for better debugging.
*   Improved variable names and added type hints.
*   Replaced the repetitive path appends with a more efficient way of adding paths to `sys.path`.
*   Improved the readability and structure of the code.
*   Corrected potential errors in file paths and added error handling for missing notebooks.
*   Used more specific terminology in comments (e.g., instead of "get," using "retrieval").
