# hypotez/src/suppliers/bangood/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, which is a subclass of the `Grbr` class (presumably from a parent module).  It's responsible for scraping product data from the Banggood website.  The class provides methods to extract various product fields, handling potential error conditions during the web scraping process.  It also utilizes a decorator for closing pop-up windows.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class is designed to gather product information from the Banggood website.  It inherits from the `Grbr` class and likely provides an extended set of functionalities for Banggood-specific data extraction.

**Attributes**:

- `supplier_prefix`: (str) A string identifying the supplier, in this case "bangood".

**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object.  It sets the `supplier_prefix` and calls the constructor of the parent class (`super().__init__`). It also initializes a `Context.locator_for_decorator` which can be used with the `@close_pop_up` decorator.


**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for interacting with the web page.


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: Asynchronous function to fetch product data from a Banggood product page.


**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance to use for interaction.


**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product data.


**Implementation Details**: This method includes a `fetch_all_data` function which calls various other methods (e.g., `id_product`, `description_short`, etc.) to extract specific product information.  The implementation uses `kwards` to pass arguments. This method is significantly long due to the many functions it calls (implied).


## Functions (Implied)

The documentation is incomplete for the functions that are called within `grab_page`.  Further elaboration on the functions like `id_product`, `description_short`, etc.  and their parameters, return values, and potential exceptions is needed.


## Decorators (Implied)

The code includes a commented-out decorator, `@close_pop_up`. While it's commented out, its functionality for handling pop-ups is implied and needs further explanation in a separate section.

#### `close_pop_up(value: Any = None) -> Callable`

**(Docstring from the commented-out code)**: Creates a decorator to close pop-up windows before executing a function.


**Parameters**:

- `value` (Any, optional): Additional value for the decorator. Defaults to `None`.


**Returns**:

- `Callable`: A decorator that wraps the function to be executed after closing pop-ups.


**Exceptions**:

- `ExecuteLocatorException`: Raised if an error occurs during the execution of the pop-up closing locator.



**Missing Documentation**: The implementation details of the decorator are currently not documented (as it is commented out). Further details are required to complete the documentation.
