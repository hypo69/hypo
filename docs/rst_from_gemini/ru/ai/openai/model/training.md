# hypotez/src/ai/openai/model/training.py

This Python script provides a class `OpenAIModel` for interacting with the OpenAI API, managing assistants, handling model training, and providing functionalities for sending messages, describing images, and dynamically fine-tuning the model.


## Class: `OpenAIModel`

This class encapsulates interactions with the OpenAI API, including:

* **Initialization (`__init__`):**  Initializes the OpenAI client, sets up the assistant, creates a thread, and optionally provides a system instruction. It loads available models and assistants. Critically, it now handles potential errors more robustly, using `try...except` blocks to catch exceptions during the loading process and provides informative error logging.

* **`list_models`:**  Fetches and returns a list of available OpenAI models.  Handles potential API errors.

* **`list_assistants`:** Loads a list of available assistants from a JSON file.  Handles potential file loading errors.

* **`set_assistant`:** Sets the assistant to be used by ID. Crucial for changing assistants without reinitializing the whole model.

* **`_save_dialogue`:** Saves the dialogue history to a JSON file. This is crucial for storing interactions and potential retraining later.  The file path is now dynamically constructed to use the current model name and date for better organization.

* **`determine_sentiment`:**  Analyzes a message and returns its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Uses basic keyword matching for sentiment analysis.

* **`ask`:** Sends a message to the OpenAI model, handles potential API errors, performs sentiment analysis on the response, and saves the conversation to the dialogue log.  Now gracefully handles errors and retries up to a specified number of times. The most important improvement is handling the messages properly, now escaping quotes to prevent issues with OpenAI API.

* **`describe_image`:** Sends an image to the OpenAI model for description. Uses `base64encode` to properly handle the image upload. More robust error handling. This now uses the proper chat completion method for image description.

* **`describe_image_by_requests`:**  (Deprecated) An older function for image description, now marked for removal or restructuring in the documentation.

* **`dynamic_train`:** Fine-tunes the model based on the current dialogue log. Loads the dialogue from a JSON file and performs fine-tuning using the `Training` API. Significantly improved error handling for improved robustness.

* **`train`:** Trains the model on provided data (CSV or directory of CSV files). This is a critical training function that now loads from a directory or file and creates training jobs on OpenAI. It also handles saving the job IDs to `job_ids.json` to track the training status and potential future re-training.

* **`save_job_id`:** Saves the training job ID with its description to a JSON file. Crucial for tracking and managing training processes.


## Module-level Variables

* **`MODE`:**  Currently set to 'debug'. This is a placeholder for controlling the execution mode.

## Function: `main`

Provides example usage of the `OpenAIModel` class, demonstrating:

* Initializing the model.
* Listing available models and assistants.
* Sending a message and getting a response.
* Dynamic training.
* Model training using CSV data.
* Saving training job IDs.
* Describing an image.

## File Structure and Dependencies

* The code relies on `gs`, a crucial module for accessing Google Drive files and credentials, which is assumed to be imported.  Verify its presence.
* Imports include necessary libraries like `openai`, `pandas`, `pathlib`, and others.
* The `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`, and `j_dumps` functions are assumed to be for handling JSON data, and `pprint` is for pretty printing. Verify their presence in the `src.utils` module.
* `base64encode` and `md2dict` functions (for converting images to base64 and markdown to dictionaries, respectively) are likely part of `src.utils.convertors`.  Verify these imports.
* `save_csv_file` is in `src.utils.csv`.


## Key Improvements and Considerations

* **Robust Error Handling:** Added extensive `try...except` blocks throughout the code to catch and log potential exceptions.  This significantly improves the reliability of the script.
* **Clearer Logging:** Improved logging messages using the `logger` instance for better debugging and tracking of issues.
* **Dialogue Saving:** The dialogue is now consistently saved to a JSON file, which is critical for tracking interactions and potentially re-training the model.  The file name is now more informative.
* **Model Flexibility:**  The code can dynamically adjust the model used.
* **Image Description Improvements:** The image description functionality is now more robust and uses the correct method from the OpenAI library.


This improved documentation clarifies the functionality, dependencies, and potential issues. Remember to install the necessary packages, like `openai`, `pandas`, etc.  Check your `requirements.txt` for a comprehensive list.  Verify the functionality and dependencies in your project environment to ensure they are available.
