**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `execute_locator` method. This avoids actual interactions with the browser or file system, making the tests much faster and more reliable.

2. **Asynchronous Execution:** The tests now correctly run the asynchronous methods (`grab_page`, `local_image_path`) within an event loop using `loop.run_until_complete`.  This is vital for testing asynchronous code.

3. **Exception Handling:**  Added a test `test_grab_page_exception` to verify that the `grab_page` function handles exceptions raised within the asynchronous logic. This is important for robustness.  Also, added `test_local_image_path_exception` to test the specific error handling for the `ExecuteLocatorException`.

4. **`ProductFields` Fixture:**  Now uses a `mock_product_fields` fixture to create a mocked `ProductFields` object, which avoids needing a real `ProductFields` instance.

5. **`save_png` Mocking:** The `save_png` function is also mocked so the tests don't try to save files, which would break the isolation.

6. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more specific and descriptive, making it easier to understand the outcome of each test case.

7. **Complete Test Coverage:** The tests now cover both success and failure scenarios for `grab_page` and `local_image_path`, including edge cases (like empty input).

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_graber.py`) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_graber.py`


This revised solution addresses the crucial aspects of testing asynchronous code and provides much more comprehensive and reliable tests. Remember to adapt the mocks and assertions to the specific details and expected behaviors of your actual code.
