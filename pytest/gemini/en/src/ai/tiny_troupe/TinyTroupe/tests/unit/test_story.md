**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `TinyWorld`:** The crucial addition is a `MockTinyWorld` class.  This is *essential* for unit testing because `TinyStory` relies on interactions with `TinyWorld`, which are complex and involve external dependencies.  A mock allows you to control the input data (like the `broadcast` message) and avoid needing the entire `TinyWorld` setup.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more explicitly describe the test conditions.

3. **Input Validation (Crucial):** The `test_story_start_invalid_requirements` test demonstrates how to check for correct input types.  This is important for preventing unexpected behavior.

4. **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test exceptions, such as when there's no prior broadcast in `test_story_continuation_empty_broadcast`.

5. **Type Assertions:** Added `assert isinstance(start, str)` and similar checks to ensure the function returns the expected data type.

6. **Empty Broadcast Test:**  Added a test `test_story_continuation_empty_broadcast` to cover the case where there is no prior broadcast, which would cause an error in the original code.  This is a crucial edge case.

7. **Setup Fixture (Placeholder):** The `setup` fixture is a placeholder.  If your tests need any setup like initializing certain objects, you can put it in this fixture.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Replace the placeholder `from testing_utils import proposition_holds` with the actual import path.
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
3.  Run `pytest` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.


This improved solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage, avoiding issues related to external dependencies and handling potential errors more effectively. Remember to replace the `MockTinyWorld` with a real `TinyWorld` instantiation if possible for integration testing.  This approach enables more reliable and maintainable tests for your code. Remember to install `pytest`.
