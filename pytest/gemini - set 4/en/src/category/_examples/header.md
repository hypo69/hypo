```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixture for `dir_root`:**  The `dir_root_fixture` now provides a way to control the root directory path during testing.  This makes the tests more robust and reusable.

2. **`test_dir_root_calculation`:** This test verifies that the code correctly extracts the part of the path containing "hypotez".

3. **`test_sys_path_append`:**  This test is crucial because the provided code appends the directory to `sys.path` multiple times.  This test checks that the path is present at least once, simulating the actual code's behavior.  Critically, it now restores the `sys.path` to its original state after the test, preventing unintended side effects in subsequent tests.

4. **`test_dir_src_creation`:** This test verifies that the 'src' directory path is constructed correctly relative to the root directory.


**Why these are better than just running the code:**

* **Isolation:** Tests run independently, avoiding potential conflicts between different parts of the code.
* **Robustness:** Using fixtures allows you to control inputs, making the tests more reliable.
* **Clearer assertions:** The tests directly assert the expected behavior, providing more useful feedback in case of failure.
* **Maintainability:**  Tests are easier to understand and modify than the code itself.



**Important Considerations for More Comprehensive Tests:**


* **`from src import gs` etc:**  The code imports various modules. You would need tests verifying that the module imports correctly (if there are special requirements for their location).
* **Error Handling:**  Add tests to check for exceptions that might be raised when the paths are invalid or the files don't exist.
* **Real Data (if possible):**  Ideally, you would have sample data representing the contents of the file paths you are handling, so you can test how the code reacts to different file contents.


To make the tests even more comprehensive, you would need to provide the parts of the code that use the calculated paths (e.g., the parts involving `dir_root`, `dir_src` and file access) so tests can validate their functionality.  The tests above are tailored to validate the path calculation and manipulation logic itself.
