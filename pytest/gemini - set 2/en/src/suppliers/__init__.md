**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** A basic `example_supplier_data` fixture is included. Replace this with a fixture that provides more realistic data specific to your `Supplier` implementation.

2. **Test Structure:** Tests are organized by class (Supplier, Graber, etc.).  Each test function has a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `test_supplier_get_products_valid_input`).

3. **Valid Input Tests:**  `test_supplier_get_products_valid_input` demonStartes a basic test. You need to replace the example assertions with the expected results from your functions.

4. **Invalid/Edge Case Tests:**  `test_supplier_get_products_invalid_input` shows how to test for invalid data.  Include similar tests for invalid inputs to `Graber`, and other functions.

5. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test exception handling in `test_graber_get_page_invalid_url`.  This is crucial.

6. **Specific Error Messages:** The assertions now check for specific error messages in the exception, which is more robust than just checking if an exception occurred.

7. **Context class tests:** Added basic tests for the `Context` class, demonStarting how to check for the creation of a driver object.

**Crucial Next Steps:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  The example assertions (`assert isinstance(supplier.get_products(), list)`) are placeholders.  Replace them with the *actual* expected behavior and return types from your code.  Analyze the `Supplier` and `Graber` classes' methods' specifications to determine the appropriate assertions.

* **More Robust Fixtures:**  Create more comprehensive fixtures, especially if the Supplier class involves external dependencies or needs to create mock objects.

* **Realistic Data:** Use realistic, representative data in fixtures to test your functions more thoroughly.


* **Thorough Testing:**  Consider additional edge cases, invalid inputs, and scenarios that could cause unexpected behaviors.

* **Dependencies:** If `Supplier` or `Graber` depend on external libraries (e.g., a webdriver), consider using mocks or a `pytest-mock` library to test the parts you control independently of the external dependency.


This improved example provides a starting point for creating complete and effective tests. Remember to tailor the tests to the specific requirements and behavior of your code. Remember to install the `pytest` library: `pip install pytest`
