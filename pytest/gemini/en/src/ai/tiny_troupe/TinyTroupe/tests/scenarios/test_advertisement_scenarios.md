**Explanation of Improvements and Key Changes:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `mocker.patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock external calls (e.g., `Simulation.run`, `ResultsExtractor.extract_results_from_agent`).  This is crucial for isolating tests and preventing dependencies on external resources like databases or network requests.  This makes the tests independent.
* **Fixtures for Data:**  Example ads (e.g., `travel_ad_1`, `travel_ad_2`) should be fixtures.  This avoids repeating the same data across multiple tests and makes the tests more readable and maintainable. The example shows how to create a fixture to pass the data more easily.
* **Assertions on Mocks:** The assertions are now focused on verifying the behavior of the mocked methods and the data they return.
* **Error Handling:** Added basic error handling (e.g., `assert res is not None`) to prevent unexpected crashes due to missing or incorrect data from the mocked methods.
* **File Existence Test:** The `test_consumer_profiling_scenario` includes a test to ensure the cache file is not created until the end, preventing unexpected behavior if the files are left around.


**How to Use the Improvements:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Carefully replace all placeholder comments (`# ...`) with the actual implementations from the original code, ensuring that the data handling and functions being tested are correctly reflected in the tests.
2. **Mock Relevant Methods:** Modify the mocks to cover the external functions used in your scenario.  Crucially, mock the behavior of `extract_results_from_agent` to return known data instead of making actual network calls or database requests, which is essential for testing the internal logic of your code.
3. **Adapt Assertions:** Ensure that your assertions (`assert ...`) accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions based on the mocked data.  For example, if a function is expected to return a specific value, assert that it does.
4. **Implement Data Fixtures:** Add fixtures for data like advertisements (e.g., `travel_ad_1`, `travel_ad_2`) to prevent code repetition and enhance test clarity.
5. **Cleanup (Optional but Recommended):** Add `os.remove` calls to remove the temporary files created by the test, preventing conflicts with other tests.

This revised structure provides a more robust and reliable test suite for your code. Remember to install the `pytest` and `unittest.mock` libraries if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pytest unittest
```
