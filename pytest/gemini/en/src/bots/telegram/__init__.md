#     """Tests instantiation with an invalid mode."""
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         TelegramBot("invalid")

# def test_telegram_bot_send_message_exception(telegram_bot_instance):

#         telegram_bot_instance.send_message("Too long message")
#     assert "Message too long" in str(excinfo.value)


# Important: If the `TelegramBot` class has methods that return values or perform side effects,
# add tests to cover those as well.  The `MockTelegramBot` example above
# is just a start; you need to test actual *behavior* (e.g., interactions with external services).


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses a `MockTelegramBot` class.  Critically, this isolates the tests from the actual Telegram Bot library.  This is essential for reliable testing.  If the Telegram Bot code uses external resources (like an API), this mock allows you to test internal logic without needing these resources.

2. **`pytest.fixture`:** The `telegram_bot_instance` fixture is used to create and provide the `MockTelegramBot` object.  This is good practice as it keeps the tests clean and prevents repeated setup within each test function.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_telegram_bot_creation`).

4. **Example Tests (Crucial):**  The examples now show how to test the `send_message` method with an assertion that the result matches the expected behavior.

5. **Edge Case Example:**  An example of a test for an invalid mode is added, demonstrating how to use `pytest.raises`.  You should add similar tests for any potential invalid inputs your actual `TelegramBot` might receive.

6. **Exception Handling:** The example shows how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises` which is important for robustness.  The assertion now verifies the *message* in the exception which is better than just checking that any exception was raised.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_telegram_bot.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_telegram_bot.py`


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **External Dependencies:** If your `TelegramBot` interacts with a Telegram API, you'll need a proper mock for that API.  Simply mocking the `send_message` method won't be enough for testing the API interactions themselves.
* **Complex Logic:** If your TelegramBot code has more intricate logic, the test cases need to cover more scenarios of input values and behavior.
* **Data:**  If your `TelegramBot` works with data, ensure you provide various test cases with valid, invalid, and edge case data.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the example tests with actual tests for your *specific* `TelegramBot` implementation. Remember to test the *behavior* of your code, not just isolated parts.
