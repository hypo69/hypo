**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

*   Added missing imports `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` and `from src.logger import logger`.  However, as these are not needed for the provided code, they were commented out in the initial improved code, but now there are removed to avoid unnecessary imports.
*   Rewrote the module docstring in reStructuredText (RST) format for better documentation.
*   Added a docstring for the `MODE` variable, although it is not essential, to improve readability. This is commented out to be compatible with the instructions.
