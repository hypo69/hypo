```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes to test in the provided code.
# Therefore, no tests are needed.
# If there were functions or classes, this would be where the test cases would go.

# Example (if there was a function in the provided code)
# def some_function(arg1, arg2):
#     # ... code ...
#     return result

# def test_some_function_valid_input():
#     result = some_function(1, 2)
#     assert result == expected_result

# def test_some_function_invalid_input():
#    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#        some_function("a", 2)


```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code `hypotez/src/translators/__init__.py` only defines a global variable `MODE`.  There are no functions or methods to test.  Therefore, no meaningful test cases can be written based on this code snippet alone.

**How to Write Tests for a More Complex Example**

If the code contained functions, methods, or classes, the tests would be structured like the example comments:


1. **Identify the functions/methods/classes:**  Determine what parts of the code you need to test.
2. **Define Inputs:**  Plan different types of input data for each function you will test (valid, invalid, edge cases, boundary conditions).
3. **Define Expected Outputs:**  What should the function return for each set of input data?
4. **Write Test Functions:**  Use `pytest.raises` for exception handling and `assert` statements to check that the function returns the expected output.  Make the test function names clear and descriptive.

**Example with a Hypothetical Function**

```python
import pytest

def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_add_numbers_positive():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5

def test_add_numbers_zero():
    assert add_numbers(0, 5) == 5

def test_add_numbers_negative():
    assert add_numbers(-2, 3) == 1

def test_add_numbers_with_string():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        add_numbers(2, "a") # Should raise TypeError

# Edge cases
def test_add_numbers_large_value():
    assert add_numbers(1000000, 1000000) == 2000000
```


In summary, to create useful tests, you need the actual functions to test, and from there we can provide appropriate test cases covering their expected behavior with different inputs.
