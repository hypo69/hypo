# hypotez/src/ai/gemini/html_chat/header.py

## Overview

This module, located in the `hypotez/src/ai/gemini/html_chat` directory, appears to be a configuration or utility module for the Gemini HTML chat application.  It defines constants and likely handles path manipulation related to the project.


## Constants

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A string constant likely representing the operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  The current value is 'dev'.

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**: A path object representing the absolute path to the root of the 'hypotez' project.  It's likely used for resolving relative paths.

**Type**: `pathlib.Path`

**Initialization**: `__root__ : Path = os.getcwd() [:os.getcwd().rfind(r'hypotez')+7]`  This line retrieves the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`) and extracts the portion up to and including the 'hypotez' directory.


## Imports

### `sys`, `os`, `pathlib`

These standard libraries are imported for their respective functionalities.  Importantly, `sys.path.append(__root__)` is used to include the project root in Python's module search path. This allows modules in other parts of the project to be imported.


## Functions (None explicitly defined)


## Notes

The presence of numerous multi-line docstrings without associated function definitions suggests that this module might be used for documentation purposes or for organizing paths and configurations for the `gemini` and/or `html_chat` functionality. The extensive use of multi-line strings (`"""..."""`) is a common practice for generating documentation using tools like Sphinx.
