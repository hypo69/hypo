# Changes Made

*   Added a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   Added a function `borderify_page` with an RST docstring.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
*   Wrapped potentially problematic code blocks (`document.body.style.border = ...` and `alert()`) in `try...except` blocks to catch and log potential errors using the logger.
*   Added `return` statements within `except` blocks to prevent the script from continuing execution if an error occurs.  This is essential for preventing unexpected behavior and unexpected crashes.
*   Added comments (`# ...`) as needed to explain the purpose of code blocks.  Comments are now more precise, avoiding vague terms.
*   Refactored the original single line into the `borderify_page` function. This makes the code more organized and manageable, promoting better code structure and potential reusability.
*  Added appropriate imports for the `jjson` library.
*  Added appropriate import for the `logger` from `src.logger`.
*   Corrected comment style according to the RST standards.
*   Changed `json.load` to `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` as instructed.
