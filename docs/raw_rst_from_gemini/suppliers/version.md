```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Critically, it prints a descriptive error message (`print(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")`). This is crucial for debugging.  A production environment should log the error instead of just printing it to the console, using a logging framework.


* **Typo Correction:** The typo in `__copyright__` is fixed to `copyright`.


* **Type Hinting (minor):** While type hinting is used elsewhere in the code, the variable `settings` is still implicitly dynamic in the main body of the file; a type hint can be added for `settings`.


* **Readability (minor):**  Using `=` for assignment in the variable assignments improves readability slightly.  (e.g., `__version__ = ...`)


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:** The error handling makes the code much more resilient.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the program won't crash.
* **Debugging:**  The error messages greatly help diagnose issues when the code fails.
* **Maintainability:** Consistent coding style and clear error handling make the code easier to understand and modify later.
* **Production readiness:**   Logging is essential for production code to track issues and diagnose problems without needing to rerun the code to figure out what went wrong.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, My Company",
  "cofee": "https://www.example.com/support"
}
```

This revised code is significantly more production-ready and easier to maintain. Remember to install a logging module (e.g., `logging`) if you plan to use it for production environments.  For example:


```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)  # Adjust level as needed

try:
    # ... code to load settings ...
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    logging.error(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")
    # ... handling ...
```
