# <algorithm>

**Spinning Cursor Generator (spinning_cursor):**

1. Enters an infinite loop (`while True`).
2. Iterates through the characters `'|', '/', '-', '\\'`.
3. Yields each character.

**Example:**
```
Iteration 1: Yields '|'
Iteration 2: Yields '/'
Iteration 3: Yields '-'
Iteration 4: Yields '\'
```

**Show Spinner (show_spinner):**

1. Creates a generator instance (`spinner`) from `spinning_cursor`.
2. Calculates the end time (`end_time`) based on the input `duration`.
3. Enters a loop that continues until the current time exceeds `end_time`.
4. Retrieves the next character from the `spinner` generator (`next(spinner)`).
5. Prints the retrieved character to the standard output (`sys.stdout.write`).
6. Forces the output to be displayed immediately (`sys.stdout.flush()`).
7. Pauses for the specified `delay` using `time.sleep()`.
8. Overwrites the previous character with a backspace (`sys.stdout.write('\b')`).


**Example (show_spinner):**

Input: `duration=3.0`, `delay=0.2`

* Iteration 1: Prints '|', pauses 0.2s, overwrites with '\b'
* Iteration 2: Prints '/', pauses 0.2s, overwrites with '\b'
* ... and so on.

**Dependencies:**

The code imports `time` (for time-related operations) and `sys` (for interacting with the standard input/output streams).  These are standard Python libraries and are not specific to any `src` packages.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

* **`time`**: Provides functions for working with time, used for controlling the delay between spinner updates and calculating the duration of the spinner.
* **`sys`**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, notably `sys.stdout` for writing to the console and `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

**Classes:**

The code does not define any classes.


**Functions:**

* **`spinning_cursor()`**:
    * **Arguments**: None.
    * **Return Value**: A generator object.
    * **Purpose**: Creates a generator that yields the next character in the spinning cursor sequence (`|`, `/`, `-`, `\`). This allows for efficient and memory-saving creation of the sequence.  It's critical for keeping the program from using memory linearly to hold the entire sequence.
    * **Example Usage (in `show_spinner`):**  The `show_spinner` function uses `next(spinner)` to get the next symbol.
* **`show_spinner(duration: float = 5.0, delay: float = 0.1)`**:
    * **Arguments**:
        * `duration`: The time in seconds for the spinner to run.
        * `delay`: The time in seconds between each spinner update.
    * **Return Value**: None.
    * **Purpose**: Shows a spinning cursor on the console for a specified duration. The function handles the timing, outputting each character, delaying between iterations, and then clearing the previous character with a backspace. This is a useful utility function for indicating that a process is running and taking time.
    * **Example Usage (in `if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: The example demonstrates how to call `show_spinner` to display a spinner for 5 seconds.


**Variables:**

* **`MODE`**: A string variable with the value 'dev'. This is a global variable, but its purpose isn't clear within the provided context. More context is needed to assess its usage.
* **`duration`**, `delay`: These are parameters to the `show_spinner()` function that control the duration of the spinner and the delay between each iteration.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code doesn't include any error handling.  If `show_spinner` is called with invalid `duration` or `delay` values, the code may silently behave in undesirable ways.
* **Robustness:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is good for testing, but if this were part of a larger project, it would be important to consider the implications of running the code from the command line (e.g., `python my_module.py`) versus importing it as a utility module from another script.

**Relationship with other parts of the project:**

The file `hypotez/src/utils/cursor_spinner.py` provides a utility function for showing a spinning cursor.  It is likely part of a larger project where it might be used to visualize long-running operations (like I/O processing, data loading, etc.) in various parts of the application.
