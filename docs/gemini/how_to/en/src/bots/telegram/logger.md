How to use the `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/logger.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/logger.py`, provides logging functionality for Telegram bots.

**Configuration:**

The module currently defines a single variable:

```python
MODE = 'dev'
```

This variable, `MODE`, is a string currently set to 'dev'.  This likely controls the logging level or destination (e.g., whether logs are sent to a file, console, or both).  **Crucially, the meaning of this `MODE` variable is *not* defined within this snippet.**

**To use the logging functionality:**

1. **Import the module:**

   ```python
   import hypotez.src.bots.telegram.logger as logger
   ```

2. **Understand the intended use of the `MODE` variable:**  The documentation string hints that the `MODE` variable impacts logging behavior.  The next steps depend on how the `MODE` variable is used within the module.

   * **If the module uses the `MODE` variable to select a logging configuration:**
     You need to understand how different values for `MODE` will affect the logging.  For example, a `MODE` of `dev` might enable verbose logging to the console, whereas `prod` might redirect the logs to a file and suppress certain log levels.  Examine the module's source code to determine how the different `MODE` values are handled.

3. **Configure logging (if necessary):** The module's implementation might already handle default configurations based on the `MODE`.  If the module allows user configuration, examine documentation for the available configuration options.

4. **Log messages:**  The documentation string states this is a logging module, so you'll likely use standard Python logging functions.  For example:

   ```python
   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Get a logger instance.
   logger.info("Bot started successfully.")
   logger.error("An error occurred: %s", exception)  # Example of logging an error with context
   ```


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
import logging
import hypotez.src.bots.telegram.logger as logger

# Assuming the logger has appropriate setup based on 'MODE'
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger.MODE = 'dev'  #  This assumes the module allows modification of the MODE variable
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Bot starting")

# ... Your bot code ...
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing context:**  The provided code snippet lacks details about how the module uses `MODE` for logging. Without this information, it's impossible to give a complete usage guide.
* **File location:** This code snippet contains a file location. To use the module, ensure you have the file in the specified location or modify your import path if needed.


**Next Steps:**

Examine the source code of `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/logger.py` to fully understand:

* How the `MODE` variable is used to control logging.
* Available configuration options (if any).
* The specific logging functions provided.
