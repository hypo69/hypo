## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/ai/myai/traffic_light.py`

This guide explains how to use the `traffic_light.py` module, part of the `myai` package.  The module appears to be intended for handling traffic light related logic within a larger AI system.  **Crucially, the provided Python code lacks the core logic and operation description promised in the comments.**  The `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` line specifies the encoding, which is standard practice.  The shebang lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`) specify the interpreter.

**Missing Information:**

The documentation comments (`"""Docstrings"""`) are incomplete and unhelpful.  There is no description of the module's purpose, classes, functions, or how to interact with it.  The link (`https://habr.com/ru/articles/849414/`) is in Russian and may not provide sufficient detail.  The comment that says "HERE SHOULD BE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULE OPERATION!" is a critical placeholder that MUST be filled.  **You need to provide a description of the traffic light's states, the API (functions/classes), and example usage to make this module usable.**

**How to Use (Placeholder):**

Once the module's documentation is complete, usage will likely involve:

1. **Importing the module:**
   ```python
   import traffic_light
   ```

2. **Accessing the defined variables (or the state):**
   ```python
   current_mode = traffic_light.MODE
   ```

3. **Calling functions to control traffic light logic (e.g.):**
   ```python
   traffic_light.set_light_state("green")  # Or some other relevant function
   traffic_light.get_current_state()  # To obtain the current state
   traffic_light.simulate_traffic_flow()  # Simulate traffic flow
   ```


**Critical Next Steps:**

To create a proper usage guide, please:

* **Fill in the missing comments and docstrings.** Detail the intended functionality of the module.
* **Define clear classes and functions.** What are the inputs and outputs?
* **Provide examples.** Demonstrate how to use the module to achieve various tasks.
* **Define relevant variables.** Clarify what `MODE` represents and if other variables control the traffic light's behavior.


**Example (Illustrative, needs actual implementation):**

```python
import traffic_light

# Set the traffic light to green
traffic_light.set_light_state("green")

# Get the current state of the traffic light
current_state = traffic_light.get_current_state()
print(f"Current traffic light state: {current_state}")

# Simulate the traffic light changing
traffic_light.simulate_traffic_light_change()
```

Without the necessary information in the module itself (and the related system design), this usage guide is incomplete.  A full description of how the traffic light changes states, interacts with other parts of the system, and what inputs affect it is necessary to make this guide useful.
