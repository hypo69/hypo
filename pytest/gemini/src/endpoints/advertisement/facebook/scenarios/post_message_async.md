**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` class and its methods.  This isolates the tests from the external dependencies (Selenium, etc.) and makes them much faster and more reliable.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive and explicitly state the conditions being tested (e.g., `test_post_title_scroll_failure`).
* **Exception Handling:** Tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically test exception handling.
* **Edge Cases:**  The tests cover cases where `scroll` might fail, opening the box fails, and `add_message` fails.
* **`upload_media` Tests:** Added tests to handle cases where media upload fails (`foto_video_input` returns `False`) and empty `products` list.
* **`promote_post` Tests:** Added test for cases where any step in `promote_post` fails (e.g., `post_title`, `upload_media`).
* **Error Handling:** Added a test specifically to cover the case where the locator data (loaded from the JSON file) might be invalid or missing, handling the exception raised.
* **Asynchronous Tests:** Wrapped asynchronous functions with `asyncio.run` for proper execution within the test environment.


**Before Running:**

- Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
- Ensure your `gs.path.src` is correctly configured to point to the correct location for the `locators` and `translations` files.  It is *crucial* that your mocks reflect the actual structure.


**How to Extend:**

1.  **Add more tests:**  Focus on testing various scenarios and error conditions within each function.
2.  **More complex mocks:** If needed, mock more complex interactions with external services or other modules.
3. **Stubbing `logger`:**  Consider mocking the `logger` to avoid actually logging messages during the test execution.


Remember to replace the dummy values in the mocks with actual test data for specific scenarios. This improved structure provides a more robust and maintainable test suite. Remember to adjust the file paths if they are different on your system.
