**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `settings_json_data`, `settings_file`, and `readme_file` fixtures to create and manage test data.  This makes tests more reusable and avoids redundant file creation in each test.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the input and expected outcome.
* **Edge Case and Error Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` tests a scenario where no marker files are found. The `test_readme_loading` test verifies the handling of non-existent `README.MD` files.  Crucially, I've created `test_settings_loading` to cover both a valid case (when settings exist) and the exception handling part.
* **Pathlib:** Using `Pathlib` consistently for file path manipulation for better code readability and robustness.
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Utilized `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` to create temporary directories for testing, avoiding conflicts with existing files and ensuring clean test isolation.
* **Import Correction:** Corrected the import statement `from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt.scenarios.header import set_project_root`.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** Created tests covering various scenarios (valid input, marker in parent, no marker files).  Also tests for FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError.
* **Realistic Tests:** The `test_project_info_from_settings` example now leverages the `settings_file` fixture to demonstrate correct usage of the returned value from the `set_project_root`.
* **Type Hints:** Added type hints to `set_project_root` function.
* **File Structure:** Created temporary test files using the correct file path structure to ensure that the `set_project_root` function is tested in a realistic manner.


This improved solution addresses the requirements for comprehensive, isolated, and well-commented `pytest` tests. Remember to adapt the fixture usage and test cases to exactly match the specific requirements and error handling within your actual code. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/scenarios/header.py` with the actual path.
