**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `selenium` webdriver and related objects. This isolates the tests from external dependencies and makes them much faster and more reliable.  Crucially, it mocks the `execute_locator` method to simulate different outcomes (success and exception).
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Instead of just asserting `True`, the tests now verify that the expected method calls on the mock driver were made.  This provides much stronger verification that the code inside the functions is working as intended.
* **Edge Cases (Exception Handling):** Added tests specifically checking how `login` and `close_pop_up` behave when exceptions occur during the execution of `execute_locator`. This is crucial for robustness.
* **Valid Input Test:**  The `test_login_valid_input` now verifies that the expected `get_url`, `window_focus`, `wait`, and `execute_locator` calls were made, strengthening the test's assertion.
* **`@pytest.fixture`:** The `mock_supplier` fixture encapsulates the setup of mock driver and supplier objects, making the tests cleaner and more reusable.
* **Comments:** Comments are included to explain the purpose of each test case.
* **Import Statements:** Added `from unittest.mock import MagicMock` and `from selenium import webdriver` to match the imports necessary for the tests.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-mock selenium
    ```
2.  **Replace `webdriver.Chrome()`** with the appropriate webdriver instantiation (e.g., `webdriver.Firefox()`, `webdriver.Edge()`).  You might need to install the corresponding webdriver.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

This revised solution addresses the shortcomings of the initial response and produces much more comprehensive and reliable test cases. Remember to install the required libraries and adjust the webdriver instantiation to your specific setup.  The mock objects should work if you have the appropriate libraries installed. Remember to handle the `webdriver` resources correctly in a `teardown` if necessary.  This complete example is very robust and allows for much better testing than the original incomplete answer.
