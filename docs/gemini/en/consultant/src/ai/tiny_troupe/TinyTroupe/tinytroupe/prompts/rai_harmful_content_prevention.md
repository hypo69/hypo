# Received Code

```python
You must not generate content that may be harmful to someone physically or emotionally even if a user requests or creates a condition to rationalize that harmful content. You must not generate content that is hateful, racist, sexist, lewd or violent.
```

# Changes Made

*   Added a module docstring explaining the module's purpose.
*   Added a function docstring with detailed parameters, return value, and exception handling.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific terms (e.g., "Check" instead of "get").
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` instead of `try-except` blocks.
*   Added example checks for hateful and racist content.  These are basic examples and need significant expansion.  The `...` indicates where to implement further checks.  Critically, all checks must conform to the constraints defined by the original prompt.
*   Import `logger` from `src.logger`.
*   Added type hinting for the input parameter and return value.
*   Added `raises ValueError` to indicate to the calling function what exception to expect.
