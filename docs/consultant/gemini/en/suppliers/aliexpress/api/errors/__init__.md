```

**Changes Made**

- Added `from src.logger import logger` to import the logger for error handling.
- Commented out unused imports (e.g., `import json`, `from src.utils.jjson import ...`). These imports are likely unnecessary in this file as it's only initializing imports.
- Added a module-level docstring in RST format to describe the purpose of the module.
- Added comments regarding the likely purpose of the file and the need for corresponding exception files.
- Added a TODO item to document the need for docstrings in imported exceptions.
