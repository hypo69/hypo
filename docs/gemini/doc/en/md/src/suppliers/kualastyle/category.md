# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/category.py

## Overview

This module handles the retrieval of product information from the categories of a supplier (hb.co.il) using a web driver.  It focuses on extracting product URLs and potentially handling pagination.  Crucially, it aims to maintain consistency between the supplier's categories and the PrestaShop/Aliexpress categories.  This module is designed to be adaptable to different suppliers.


## Functions

### `get_list_products_in_category`

**Description**: This function retrieves a list of product URLs from a given category page.  It handles potential pagination and logging for debugging.

**Parameters**:

- `s` (Supplier): An instance of the `Supplier` class containing relevant driver, locators, and other contextual information.


**Returns**:

- `list[str, str, None]`: A list of product URLs found on the category page.  Returns `None` if no product URLs are found.  The structure of returned list might depend on the pagination.


**Raises**:
- `Exception`: Any exception that might arise during the process of retrieving product URLs.  More specific exceptions might be raised depending on the library handling the web driver.


### `paginator`

**Description**: This function handles pagination of the category page if there are more than one page.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the `Driver` class.
- `locator` (dict): A dictionary containing locators for pagination elements.
- `list_products_in_category` (list): A list of product URLs to append new products from.


**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if pagination was performed and product URLs were added to the list, `False` otherwise.


**Raises**:
- `Exception`: Any exception that might occur during pagination.


### `get_list_categories_from_site`

**Description**: This function is responsible for retrieving a list of current categories from the supplier's website.

**Parameters**:
- `s` (Supplier): An instance of the `Supplier` class.

**Returns**:
- list or None. A list of categories or None if no categories are found.

**Raises**:
- Exception: Any exception encountered during the category retrieval process.


## Classes (Implicit)

The code imports several classes (`Supplier`, `Driver`, `gs`, `logger`) but they are not defined within this file. Their use is implied within the module.


## Error Handling


The code includes error handling using `logger` (which is a class, not an import) with warnings for empty product listings.  A `while` loop is used within `get_list_products_in_category` for pagination, breaking the loop when no further pagination is found (i.e., no next page).


## Notes

- The code utilizes the `Driver` class (and related methods like `wait`, `execute_locator`, `scroll`) for interaction with the web browser.  This strongly suggests a framework for web scraping.
- The `Supplier` class is crucial for passing context and locators, signifying a structured approach to web scraping with abstraction of the supplier logic.
- The use of `s.current_scenario['name']` in logging suggests a structured way to track the source of data collection.
- The `@todo` comment in the docstring indicates tasks needing further development or improvement.
- The function `paginator` is incomplete and needs to handle cases where there's no pagination.
- Missing code (`...`) indicates potentially important logic not included in the provided snippet.
