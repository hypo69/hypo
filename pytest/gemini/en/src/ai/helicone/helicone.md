# Add more tests if there are other functions or attributes in the file.

# You would add test cases for it:

# Example test for a specific header function (replace with the actual header function)
# def test_header_function():
#     import header # Import here if needed
#     result = header.my_header_function("test") # replace with the actual function call

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statement Test:** The code now includes a test specifically checking if the `header` module can be imported. This is crucial because a missing module import would cause a runtime error.

2. **Error Handling:** The test for importing `header` now uses a `try-except` block to catch the `ModuleNotFoundError` and fail the test appropriately.

3. **Clarity and Structure:** The tests are organized in a way that clearly distinguishes between testing the `helicone` module's variables and functions, and testing the `header` module.

4. **Commented Example:** The example test cases for `header` now are more complete and explain how to test functions within the `header` module and handle potential exceptions.

5. **Flexibility:** The comments leave space for the user to adapt and add more specific tests to their code based on the function in the `header` module.


**How to Use/Adapt:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** Change the placeholder comments in the code, such as `test_some_function`, `some_function`, `header.my_header_function`, `"test_result"`, with the actual function names and expected values from your `helicone.py` and `header.py` files.

* **Add More Tests:**  If `helicone.py` or `header.py` contains other functions, methods, or classes, add more test functions accordingly, following the structure provided. Focus on testing different input types, edge cases, and potential errors.

* **Consider Context:** If the header module is just for configuration, you might not need many tests and a simple check to ensure it's imported and exists would suffice.


This revised response provides a more robust and adaptable framework for writing comprehensive `pytest` tests for your `helicone` and `header` modules. Remember to thoroughly test all possible scenarios and expected behaviors, especially error handling and edge cases. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`).
