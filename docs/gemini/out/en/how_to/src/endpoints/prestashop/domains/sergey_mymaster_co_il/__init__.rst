How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file, `__init__.py`, appears to be part of a larger project (likely related to PrestaShop e-commerce). It initializes a module and sets a variable `MODE` to 'dev'.  The file likely contains imports and other configuration settings for a specific domain (`sergey_mymaster_co_il`).  The comments and docstrings provide metadata about the module, author, and intended platform.  This file is likely a module initialization and configuration file for a PrestaShop integration.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The Python interpreter loads the `__init__.py` file.
2. The file defines a variable `MODE` and assigns the string 'dev' to it. This likely sets the operational mode of the associated PrestaShop integration.
3. The file contains extensive docstrings and comments, providing details about the module, its purpose, and the intended environment (e.g., platform support). These comments are primarily for documentation purposes and don't affect the core functionality.
4. The file likely contains imports from other modules related to PrestaShop or related services.
5. The file initializes configuration necessary for the associated PrestaShop domain.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is not a typical usage example, as this file itself is not directly executable.
    # It's meant to be imported and used within another module or application.
    # Example of how to access the 'MODE' variable:

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains.sergey_mymaster_co_il import MODE
    print(MODE)
