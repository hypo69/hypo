# def test_function_raises_exception_on_invalid_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         invalid_input_function(some_invalid_input)
#     assert "Specific error message" in str(excinfo.value)
#     # Perform more assertions on the exception

# @pytest.fixture
# def some_data():
#     return {"key": "value"}

# Example test using a fixture (if needed):
# def test_function_using_fixture(some_data):
#     """Checks the function with provided data."""
#     # ... test logic using some_data ...


# If there are any other functions or classes in the file
# add tests for those as well.


# IMPORTANT:
# Replace the commented-out example tests with tests for any actual functions
# or classes within the provided file `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/__init__.py`.
# Add specific tests based on the function's expected behavior, input types,
# edge cases, and error handling, following the guidelines in the prompt.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Function Names:**  Test function names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_type`, `test_version_string_format`).

2. **Type Assertions:**  The tests now include assertions to check the expected types of the variables (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `MODE`). This is crucial for ensuring the variables are of the correct data structure.

3. **Specific Assertion for MODE:**  The test for `MODE` now asserts that it's equal to 'dev' if that's the expected value.

4. **Example `pytest.raises` (Commented Out):**  Included a commented-out example of how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling.  **Crucially, you *must* replace this with actual tests for any functions in the code that might raise exceptions.**

5. **Example Fixture (Commented Out):**  An example fixture is included.  **You should uncomment and implement fixtures if your code uses them.**

6. **`test_version_not_empty`:** This new test makes sure that `__version__` is not an empty string.  This is a basic but important validation.


**How to Use This Template:**

1. **Replace the placeholder comments:**  Locate any functions, classes, or variables in `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/extentions/__init__.py` that need testing.
2. **Add tests for each:**  For each function or variable, add tests to verify its behavior with valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs.  Use `pytest.raises` for exception testing.


This improved template provides a more comprehensive and practical starting point for writing tests using `pytest` for the given Python code. Remember to replace the example tests with tests that actually test the functionality of the provided code. Remember to run `pytest` from your terminal to execute these tests.
