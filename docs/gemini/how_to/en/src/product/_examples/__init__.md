How to use the `hypotez/src/product/_examples/__init__.py` module

This module appears to be part of a larger project, likely a Python application, and provides example code or configuration.  The file is primarily used for initializing the `_examples` sub-package.

**Key elements and potential use cases:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:**  This likely defines a mode (e.g., development, production) for the application.  This variable could be used to control different behaviors or configurations within the application.  It's crucial to understand how this mode affects other parts of the codebase.

* **`from packaging.version import Version`:** This imports the `Version` class from the `packaging` library, which is used for handling and comparing software versions.  You'll typically use this for comparing versions or checking for compatibility.

* **`from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__`:** This imports variables (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`) likely containing version information, documentation, and potentially other details related to the module or the project.

* **Docstrings (Triple-quoted strings):** The module and its components are heavily documented using docstrings.  These comments describe the purpose, platform compatibility, and synopsis of various sections.  It's vital to understand these docstrings for using the intended functions and variables appropriately.

* **`__init__.py`:** This file is essential for creating a package/module, and its presence signals that the `_examples` folder contains additional modules or classes.  Other modules within the `_examples` directory will likely be referenced from this file.


**How to use the example code (if available):**

Unfortunately, the provided code snippet ends with an ellipsis (`...`).  To fully understand how to use the examples, you'll need to see the complete code from the rest of the file.   Look for:

* **Functions and classes:**  Identify functions and classes within the example module.  Read their docstrings to understand their purpose and input/output parameters.
* **Example usage (if included):**  Pay close attention to any example usage that's part of the code comments or code blocks in the file.
* **Integration with other modules:**  See how the `_examples` module interacts with other parts of the project (`src.product`).


**Example (hypothetical usage based on the code provided):**


```python
import hypotez.src.product._examples  # Assuming the correct import path


# Get the current mode:
current_mode = hypotez.src.product._examples.MODE

# Check if the version is compatible:
required_version = Version('1.0.0')
current_version = Version(hypotez.src.product._examples.__version__)
if current_version >= required_version:
    print("Version compatible")
else:
    print("Version incompatible")


# Access documentation
print(hypotez.src.product._examples.__doc__)
```


**Important Considerations:**


1. **Project Structure:** The provided path (`hypotez/src/product/_examples/__init__.py`) assumes a specific directory structure.  Adjust import paths accordingly if your project is organized differently.

2. **Dependencies:** Ensure that you have the required dependencies (e.g., the `packaging` library) installed. Use `pip install packaging` to install it if needed.

3. **Error Handling:** Add appropriate error handling to deal with potential issues during imports, version checks, or interactions with example functions.


Remember to replace the hypothetical usage with the actual functions and classes defined within the `_examples` module.
