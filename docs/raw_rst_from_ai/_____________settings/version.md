**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The missing part of the path was `hypotez_settings`.  This is a standard practice to name configuration files and folders in Python projects.  Using a descriptive name like `hypotez_settings` clearly indicates the purpose of the file, making it easier to understand and maintain.

The provided code now has a correctly formatted `hypotez_settings` folder in the suggested path. This improved file structure makes it consistent with standard Python project organization and will improve the overall maintainability of the codebase.
