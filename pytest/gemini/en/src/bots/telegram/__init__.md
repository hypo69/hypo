#Important Note: To make these tests runnable, you need to have a `TelegramBot` class 
#defined in `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/bot.py` (or a similar location) with appropriate methods. 
#The above tests are placeholders and will fail if no `TelegramBot` class is present. You should replace
#the placeholder comments with actual test cases and error handling for the methods in your `TelegramBot` class.

```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The previous response lacked crucial placeholder tests. This improved version now has example tests for `TelegramBot`, assuming it exists.  Crucially, these are *example* tests, and you must replace the placeholder comments with actual tests for methods of the `TelegramBot` class.

2. **`pytest.raises`:**  The code now correctly demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling.  Replace `"incorrect_data"` with the *specific* invalid input your `TelegramBot` method is supposed to reject.

3. **Error Message Assertions:** The test now checks that the *error message* is what you expect, improving test robustness.

4. **Example Fixture:** Demonstrates how to create a `pytest` fixture for the `TelegramBot` object, allowing better organization and code reuse.

5. **Import Handling:** The tests now correctly handle the import of the `TelegramBot` class inside the testing functions, which is an important aspect for testing code in the project.

6. **Clearer Comments:** Comments now clarify the intended purpose and expected behaviors of each test.

**How to Use:**

1. **Create `TelegramBot`:** Define the `TelegramBot` class in `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/bot.py` (or the correct location).

2. **Add `TelegramBot` Methods:** Add methods to the `TelegramBot` class that your tests will target.

3. **Update Test Cases:** Modify the placeholder tests (e.g., `test_telegram_bot_invalid_input`) with specific tests for your `TelegramBot` methods and error conditions.

4. **Run Tests:** Run `pytest` from your project's root directory.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`.


This revised response provides a solid foundation for testing your Telegram bot code with `pytest`. Remember to replace the example code with your actual code, and adapt the test cases to cover the features of your `TelegramBot` class. Importantly, it's a template, and you will need to add tests to cover all the different functionalities of your `TelegramBot` class.
