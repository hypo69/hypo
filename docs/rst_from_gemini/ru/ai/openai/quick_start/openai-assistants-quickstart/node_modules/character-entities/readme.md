## What is this?

This package provides a map of named character references used in HTML (latest) to their corresponding characters.

## When should I use this?

This package is primarily useful for situations where you need to decode or encode character entities in HTML, such as in HTML parsing or minification tools.  For general use cases, consider using `parse-entities` or `stringify-entities` for more comprehensive handling of entity encoding/decoding.


## Install

This package is ESM only.

**Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, 18.0+)**

```bash
npm install character-entities
```

**Deno**

```typescript
import {characterEntities} from 'https://esm.sh/character-entities@2';
```

**Browsers**

```html
<script type="module">
  import {characterEntities} from 'https://esm.sh/character-entities@2?bundle';
  // Use characterEntities here...
</script>
```

## Use

```javascript
import { characterEntities } from 'character-entities';

console.log(characterEntities.AElig);  // Output: Æ
console.log(characterEntities.aelig);  // Output: æ
console.log(characterEntities.amp);   // Output: &
```

## API
