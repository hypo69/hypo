# hypotez/src/suppliers/bangood/scenario.py

## Overview

This module defines functions for retrieving product and category information from the Bangood website using a web driver.  It handles tasks such as locating product links on category pages and interacting with the web browser.  The module also includes logging for error handling and informational messages.  Crucially, it's designed to be adaptable to different suppliers, highlighting flexibility through variable naming and error handling.


## Functions

### `get_list_products_in_category`

**Description**: This function retrieves a list of product URLs from a given category page. It interacts with the web driver to locate and extract product links.

**Parameters**:
- `s` (Supplier): An object representing the supplier, containing necessary driver and locator information.

**Returns**:
- `list[str, str, None]`: A list of product URLs or `None` if no product URLs are found.  Potentially handles both a single string result (a single URL) or a list of URLs.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`:  A generic exception if there's an error during execution.
- `AttributeError`: Indicates a missing locator within the `s.locators` dictionary.
- `TypeError`:  Occurs if the function's result isn't a list.  It is a crucial part of the error handling to catch if the website structure has changed (for instance, the website layout changes from listing the URLs in a list to just a single URL.)


### `get_list_categories_from_site`

**Description**: Placeholder function for retrieving a list of categories from the site.  No implementation provided.

**Parameters**:
- `s` (Supplier): An object representing the supplier.

**Returns**:
- `...`: Placeholder for the return type; the implementation is not defined.
