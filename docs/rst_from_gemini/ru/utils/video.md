Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files, as well as retrieving video data.  It includes robust error handling and logging for production-quality operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Downloads a video from a URL and saves it locally asynchronously. Handles network issues, file saving errors, and empty downloads.  Returns a Path object to the saved file, or None on failure.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieves the binary data of a video file.  Handles file not found and read errors. Returns the binary data as bytes, or None on failure.


Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> try:
    ...     asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://www.example.com/a-sample-video.mp4", "downloaded_video.mp4"))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(f"Error: {e}")
    PosixPath('downloaded_video.mp4')  # or None if failed

    >>> data = get_video_data("downloaded_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Improvements:**

* **More descriptive docstrings:**  Improved clarity and detail in docstrings.  Specified potential exceptions, clearer return values.
* **Robust error handling:**  Improved error checking after the download.
* **Empty file handling:** If a download results in an empty file, it's now deleted to prevent issues later.
* **Clearer exception handling:** Catching and logging all exceptions in `save_video_from_url`.
* **Example Usage:** The example usage in the docstring is better, demonstrating a proper `try...except` block which is crucial when dealing with asynchronous code and potential errors. The main function is now better structured for testing purposes.
* **Corrected example URL:** Replaced the placeholder URL with a sample URL for realistic testing.


**How to use this improved code:**

1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install aiohttp aiofiles
    ```

2.  **Create a `src/logger.py` file:**
    ```python
    import logging

    # Configure your logger here.  Example using a file handler:
    logging.basicConfig(filename='video_downloader.log', level=logging.INFO,
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    (replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of the file containing the code)


This revised solution addresses the weaknesses of the original code and makes it significantly more robust and production-ready. Remember to adapt the error logging and file handling according to your specific needs. Importantly, ensure that the example URL you're using is valid to avoid errors. Remember to replace `https://www.example.com/a-sample-video.mp4` with a suitable URL for your use case.
