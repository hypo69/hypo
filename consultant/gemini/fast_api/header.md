MODE = 'debug'
Code is good and properly finds the project root.  No major issues are present.

**Minor Suggestions:**

* **`__root__` Variable Name:** While functional, `__root__` is a bit unconventional for a variable storing the project root.  A more descriptive name, like `project_root` or `root_path`, might improve readability.

* **Error Handling (Optional):**  While unlikely, if the code is called from outside the project structure, it might lead to an infinite loop if `marker_files` are not found.  Adding a simple check for `parent.exists()`:

```python
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if not parent.exists():
            return current_path  # Or raise an exception, depending on desired behavior
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
```

  would prevent that.  If you were to throw an exception instead, it might be better to provide more context in the error message.

* **Docstring Improvement:**  The docstring could be slightly improved by specifying what happens if *no* markers are found.  Currently, it implies the function returns the calling file's directory, but it might be better to be explicit about the fallback behavior.

```python
    Returns:
        Path: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory of the current file.  
        Returns None if no root directory is found traversing upwards.
```

* **Consistency in `marker_files`:** Using all lowercase for `marker_files` (e.g., `marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`) would improve the consistency of the code.

**Revised Code (incorporating suggestions):**

```python
""" module: src.fast_api """

""" Module to set the project root path """

import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

def find_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')):
    """ Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory,
    searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.
    
    Args:
        marker_files (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.
    
    Returns:
        Path: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory of the current file.  Returns None if no root directory is found traversing upwards.
    """
    current_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if not parent.exists():
            return current_path  # Or raise an exception if appropriate
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
            return parent
    return None

project_root = find_project_root()

if project_root:
    sys.path.append(str(project_root))
    __root__ = project_root  # Allow the user to use the variable from elsewhere
else:
    print("Error: Project root not found.")
```

This revised version is slightly more robust and readable.  Choosing between returning the current path or raising an exception depends on the desired behavior in cases where the project root isn't found.  The explicit `if project_root` check is a good practice.  And the added print statement helps with debugging. Importantly, the code now handles the case where the project root is not found, which was a subtle but potential issue in the original code. Remember to choose the error handling approach (returning current path or raising exception) that best suits your application's needs. Also adding `__root__ = project_root` for external usage.
