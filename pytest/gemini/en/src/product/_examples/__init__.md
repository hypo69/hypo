```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Version Testing:** The tests now thoroughly check the `__version__` attribute for validity using `packaging.version`.  This is crucial, as it ensures the version string is in the correct format.  It also now includes tests to check for empty strings.


2. **Docstring and Details Checks:** Tests are added to verify that `__doc__` and `__details__` are strings and are not empty.


3. **Placeholder for Hypothetical Functions:** A `test_hypothetical_function` example demonstrates how to test functions if present in the code.  Replace the placeholder with actual tests for the specific functions found in the `hypotez/src/product/_examples/__init__.py` file if they exist.


4. **Exception Handling (Best Practice):**  While the example code doesn't seem to raise exceptions, testing for potential exceptions (using `pytest.raises`) is essential for robustness. This is included in the example, in case that changes.

5. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are clear and descriptive, aiding readability and understanding.

**How to use the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_examples.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_examples.py`.


Remember to replace the placeholder `test_hypothetical_function` with actual tests for any functions defined in the `hypotez/src/product/_examples/__init__.py` file. The code now covers a more realistic and complete test suite.


**Important Considerations (if applicable):**


If `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` are intended to be imported from a specific class or function, the tests need to be modified to reflect that.  The current tests assume they're directly accessible as attributes in the module.
