// Namespace for tryxpath functions.
if (!tryxpath) {
    var tryxpath = {};
}

// Function to check if the content has loaded.
// Note: This function is not implemented and lacks details on its usage.
tryxpath.isContentLoaded = function() {
    // Placeholder function; needs implementation.
    // ...
};
```

# Changes Made

- Added a function definition for `tryxpath.isContentLoaded`. This function is now a proper function, not just a variable.
- Added a placeholder comment (`// Placeholder function; needs implementation`) to indicate the lack of implementation in the function.
- Added a more descriptive comment explaining the purpose of the `tryxpath` namespace.
- Added missing `()`.
