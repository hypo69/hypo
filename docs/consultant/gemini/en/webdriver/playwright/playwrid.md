```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing imports for `logger`, `j_loads_ns`, and corrected `playwright_crawler` import path.
- Removed unused `pen` import.
- Replaced `Any` with `SimpleNamespace` in `_load_settings` return type to match intent.
- Added `try-except` blocks for `j_loads_ns` calls to handle potential JSON errors and log them appropriately.  This is crucial for robustness.
- Improved documentation using RST format, following Sphinx standards.  Added missing type hints and more descriptive docstrings.
- Added explicit return type to `current_url` property.
- Replaced `logger.critical('Playwrid Crawler failed with an error:', ex)` with more descriptive error handling.
- Added handling for a potential `None` page object in the `current_url` property, logging error and returning `None`.
