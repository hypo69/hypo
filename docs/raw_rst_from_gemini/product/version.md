```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **`__version__` correctly assigned:** The variable `__version__` now uses the `=` assignment operator.  This is crucial for correct variable definition.
* **`__copyright__` spelling correction:** Corrected a typo from `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.
* **`try...except` block with informative message:** The `try...except` block now includes a `print` statement inside the `except` block. This provides feedback to the user if the `settings.json` file is missing or corrupted, preventing silent failures.
* **Simplified variable naming:** While the original naming was mostly correct, the use of `__version__`, `__project_name__`, etc. is standard Python style for module attributes.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code now adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines (e.g., consistent use of single quotes for strings, function and variable names with lowerCamelCase style).
* **Docstring improvements:** The docstring now clearly states the module's purpose.

**Explanation of why these changes are important:**

- **Correct variable assignment:**  Using `=` is fundamental in Python for assigning values to variables.
- **Error handling:** The `try...except` block is essential for robustness.  Your code should not crash if a file is missing or if the JSON data is invalid.
- **Clarity and Readability:** Following Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8) improves readability and maintainability.
- **Informative Error Messages:** The added print statement makes debugging easier when a `settings.json` problem occurs.

**How to use:**

This `version.py` module provides the following attributes:

* `__project_name__`: The name of the project.
* `__version__`: The version number of the project.
* `__doc__`: Documentation string (currently empty).
* `__details__`: Additional details (currently empty).
* `__author__`: The author of the project.
* `__copyright__`: The copyright information.
* `__cofee__`: A link for coffee donations.

You would use these attributes in your other Python modules or scripts like this:

```python
import hypotez.src.product.version as ver

print(f"Project: {ver.__project_name__}")
print(f"Version: {ver.__version__}")
```

Remember to have a `settings.json` file in the same directory as `version.py` with the necessary configuration data. For example:

```json
{
  "project_name": "MyAwesomeProject",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate-coffee"
}
```
