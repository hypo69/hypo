```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `AliAffiliatedProducts`:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `process_affiliate_products` method. This avoids relying on external dependencies (like an actual AliExpress API) during testing.  This is vital for making the tests independent and fast.

2. **Mock Product Objects:**  A `MockProduct` class is defined to represent the structure returned by the `process_affiliate_products` method. This allows assertions on specific attributes of the product objects.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests cover different scenarios:
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_valid_input`: Valid input.
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_empty_input`: Empty input list.
   - `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_url`: Tests for robustness (though a real API might handle this differently).

4. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed Here):**  Since the `process_affiliate_products` method is mocked, exception handling is handled internally in the mock.  We now test for different return values of the function.

5. **`test_main_function` and `test_main_function_with_products`:** These tests now directly check the output of the `main` function in `example_usage.py`.  They use `monkeypatch` to mock the `process_affiliate_products` method and capture standard output to make assertions.

6. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific about the expected output.

7. **Import Fix:**  The `example_usage` import is now fixed.

This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and focuses on testing the core logic of the code without needing actual external calls, making the tests much more reliable and maintainable. Remember to place `example_usage.py` in the same directory as your test file.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_affiliated_products.py`).
2.  Make sure `example_usage.py` is in the same directory or a location correctly imported by the Python file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_affiliated_products.py`.

This improved approach provides a much better testing strategy.
