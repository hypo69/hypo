**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **jQuery Testing in a Browser Environment is Necessary:**  The provided JavaScript code (jQuery) cannot be directly tested using Python `pytest`. You need a browser environment or a JavaScript testing framework like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress.


2. **Mock Test Cases:** The provided example now includes mock test cases.  These are *placeholder* tests for illuStartion.  Replace these with tests based on the actual jQuery functions you need to verify. For instance, if you were testing `$.each()`, you would have tests that iterate through various arrays, empty arrays, and potential errors.


3. **Data-Driven Tests (Fixtures):** Consider using `pytest.fixture` to create test data.  This will help you construct valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and boundary cases for jQuery's functions.


4. **Exception Handling:** Use `pytest.raises` to assert that jQuery functions raise the correct exceptions for invalid inputs.


5. **Focus on Specific Functions:**  Instead of trying to test the entire jQuery library, focus on specific methods, functions, or classes you want to test. The example now has tests for `$.extend()`, `.each()`, showcasing testing different parts of jQuery.


6. **Thoroughness:** Ensure your test cases cover a wide range of input scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid or unexpected inputs (e.g., passing a string to a function expecting an array), edge cases (e.g., empty arrays or objects, extremely large values), and error cases.


**How to run the mock tests (using a mock jQuery library):**

You would need to create a mock of the jQuery object or import a library that provides that. If you only need to test parts of jQuery, creating mock functions will be more suitable. The `jquery-slim-min` is a placeholder in this example.  Replace it with the actual path to your jQuery library if you have one.


**Example of a better testing Startegy (in a JavaScript environment):**


```javascript
// (In a JavaScript testing environment like Jest or Mocha)

// Mock some jQuery functions (important for testing in different environments)

jest.mock('jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js', () => {
  return {
    extend: jest.fn(),
    each: jest.fn(),
    // ... other jQuery functions you need to test
  };
});

import $ from 'jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js'; // replace with your import

describe('jQuery Tests', () => {
  it('should handle valid input for $.extend()', () => {
     const obj1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2};
     const obj2 = {"c": 3, "d": 4};
     $.extend({}, obj1, obj2); //  This call will invoke the mocked function
     expect($.extend).toHaveBeenCalledWith({}, obj1, obj2);
  });

});
```
