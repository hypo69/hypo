**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_dir` Fixture:** This is crucial for isolating tests.  It creates a temporary directory for each test run, ensuring that tests don't interfere with each other or the system's file structure.  The fixture is now properly cleaning up the directory after each test.

2. **`mock_file_system` Function:**  Creates the necessary mock files inside the test directory. This is better than hardcoding file paths.

3. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now accurately reflect the scenario being tested.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The added tests cover various scenarios, including valid input with different file structures, missing files, and the case where the marker file is located in the parent directory.

5. **Handling Missing Files:** Tests now specifically check for the case where marker files are not found, returning the expected value.

6. **Mocking `gs` and File Content:**   The tests for `settings.json` and `README.MD` are placeholders. To complete those, you would need to mock the `gs` module and create mock data (or use `monkeypatch` from pytest to replace the actual files with temporary versions).

7. **`pytest.raises` (not used here):** Because `set_project_root` doesn't raise exceptions for these specific cases, `pytest.raises` wasn't used here.  It would be applicable if the function were designed to raise exceptions for invalid inputs.


**How to use these tests and extend them:**

1.  **Install pytest:**  If you haven't already, install pytest: `pip install pytest`

2.  **Place the tests in a separate file (e.g., `test_header.py`):** Put the provided test code in a file named `test_header.py` in the same directory as your `header.py` file.

3.  **Run the tests:**  Execute `pytest test_header.py` in your terminal.

4.  **Mock `gs`:**  To test the `settings.json` and `README.MD` loading, you would need to mock the `gs` module or provide temporary `settings.json` and `README.MD` files within the `test_dir`.


This improved solution provides a more robust and maintainable set of test cases for your `header.py` code. Remember to adapt the placeholder tests for the file reading operations. Remember to `import` the modules (`os`, `Path`, etc.) in the test file. Remember to adapt the placeholder tests to account for any possible `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`. Remember to adapt the placeholder tests for the file reading operations.
