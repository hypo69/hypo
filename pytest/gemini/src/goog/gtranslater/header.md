**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy `gs` Module:** Created a `DummyGS` class to mock the `gs` module, essential for testing the code without relying on the actual `gs` module.

2. **Mocking Files:** The `mock_file_content` function creates temporary files for testing. `mock_file_not_found` safely removes the test file. This is crucial for clean test isolation.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the conditions being tested.

4. **Exception Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when `settings.json` or `README.MD` is not found or contains invalid JSON, respectively. This is critical to ensure the code handles potential issues.

5. **Edge Cases:** Tests cover scenarios like the marker file being in a parent directory, no marker files provided, and marker files in subdirectories, improving test coverage.

6. **Fixture for Dummy GS:** Created a `dummy_gs` fixture to pass the dummy `gs` object to all test functions that need it.

7. **Removed Unnecessary Comments:** Removed unnecessary comments that did not add value.

8. **Correct Path Handling:** Adjusted test setup to use the correct relative paths.

9. **README.MD Test:** Added a test for the case where README.MD is not found.


This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and well-structured, making it suitable for testing the code thoroughly. Remember to adjust the `Path` references if your project structure differs. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Run the tests with `pytest`.
