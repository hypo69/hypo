How to Use the Module Table of Contents
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block provides a table of contents for various Python modules within a project. It lists modules, their descriptions, and their purpose. This makes navigating the project's codebase easier.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code presents a hierarchical structure, using `#` and `##` for headings.
2. The top-level `# Оглавление` (Table of Contents) section outlines the module names.
3. Subsequent `##` sections provide descriptions of the corresponding modules.
4. Each module description explains the module's function in a concise manner.

Usage example
-------------------------
This code block itself *is* the usage example.  You would use this table of contents to easily find the documentation for a specific module within your project.  For example, to understand how the `webdriver` module works, you'd look for the `# webdriver` section.  To see how the `ai` module interacts with AI models, you'd look for the `# ai` section.
