**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints to `get_project_root` function.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for improved error handling and potential performance.
- Added `try...except` blocks for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD` to handle potential errors gracefully and log them.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `__root__` to `project_root`).
- Added docstrings to all functions with RST format and detailed descriptions, including type hints and potential error handling.
- Improved error handling.  Logging the error with print statements.
- Corrected the path to settings file.
- Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`.


**Explanation of Improvements:**

The improved code now uses a more robust approach to handling potential errors during file loading.  It now incorporates `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Critically, these errors are logged, providing better feedback during development and preventing the program from crashing if a file is missing or corrupted.

Crucially, the code now leverages `j_loads` for handling JSON data, as directed by the prompt.  This allows for more flexible and reliable data extraction from potential JSON files.


This improved version adheres to the prompt's requirements for RST format, type hinting, error handling, and usage of `j_loads`. Remember to place `src.utils.jjson` in a suitable location in your project for the imports to work. Also, consider using a logging library instead of print for production code.
