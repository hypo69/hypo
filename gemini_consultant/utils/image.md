Image Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None:
        Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

Examples:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now has significantly improved error handling.  Critically, it checks for errors *after* writing the file and *after* processing with PIL.  Crucially, if there's an error during processing, the corrupted temporary file is deleted (`file_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)`). This prevents the program from potentially leaving behind broken files.  Error messages are now more informative, especially when saving fails.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** The async operations are correctly used.

* **File Existence Check:** The `get_image_data` function now correctly checks if the file exists *before* attempting to open it.


* **Corrected PIL Usage:** The `image.save(file_path, "PNG")` part was removed as it's redundant and can introduce errors; PIL handles saving the format automatically when no format is specified. Also removed redundant `return` statements.

* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages now include the filename, making debugging easier.

* **Conciseness:**  A little bit more concise code.



**How to use it:**

```python
import asyncio
from hypotez.src.utils.image import save_png_from_url, get_image_data


async def main():
    # Example usage:
    url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Example.png/1200px-Example.png"
    filename = "downloaded_image.png"
    filepath = await save_png_from_url(url, filename)
    if filepath:
        print(f"Image saved to: {filepath}")
        image_data = get_image_data(filename)
        if image_data:
            print("Image data read successfully")
        else:
            print("Error reading image data.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This revised example demonstrates how to integrate the functions and handle potential errors.  Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiofiles Pillow
```
