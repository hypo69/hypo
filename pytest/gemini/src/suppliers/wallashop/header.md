**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Critically, the tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function, `Path` construction and `json.load`,  making the tests independent of the actual file system and avoiding potential side effects.
* **Dummy `gs` Module:** A `DummyGS` class is included to stub out the `gs` module, which is crucial for testing `set_project_root` in isolation.
* **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings loading, as these exceptions are expected in the code.
* **Edge Cases for `set_project_root`:** Added a test case to ensure the function handles cases where the project isn't found.
* **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **Fixture for Mock Data:** A `mock_settings` fixture simplifies the creation of mock settings for testing the settings loading part. This is crucial for separating concerns.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Create a dummy `settings.json` and `README.MD` file in the appropriate directory or adapt the mock.
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


Remember to adapt the `Path` mocking to use the appropriate directory for your project if needed.
