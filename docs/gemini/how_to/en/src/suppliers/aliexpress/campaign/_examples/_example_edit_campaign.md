# How to Use the `AliCampaignEditor` Class in `_example_edit_campaign.py`

This guide explains how to use the `AliCampaignEditor` class defined in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_examples/_example_edit_campaign.py` to edit AliExpress campaigns.

## Prerequisites

Before using this class, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.  The imports in the file suggest the following:

* `src`: Your project's source code, presumably containing modules like `gs`, `AliPromoCampaign`, `AliAffiliatedProducts`, `extract_prod_ids`, `ensure_https`, `j_loads_ns`, `j_loads`, etc.
* `utils`: A module containing utility functions for file reading, conversion, printing, and JSON handling (e.g., `read_text_file`, `get_filenames`, `j_dumps`, `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns`).
* `logger`: A logging module (likely from `src`).

Install the required modules using your project's package manager (e.g., `pip`).


## Class Description

The `AliCampaignEditor` class, inherited from `AliPromoCampaign`, is designed to manage and edit AliExpress promotional campaigns.  It appears to handle various aspects of campaign configuration, possibly including:

* **Campaign name:**  Used in campaign identification.
* **Category name:** Defines the product category for the campaign.
* **Language:** The language of the campaign materials.
* **Currency:** The currency used in the campaign.

The `__init__` method is crucial for setting up the editor.

## How to Use

To create and use an `AliCampaignEditor` instance, provide the required parameters:

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign._examples._example_edit_campaign import AliCampaignEditor

# Replace with your campaign details.
campaign_name = "My Campaign Name"
category_name = "Electronics"
language = "EN"
currency = "USD"

editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name, category_name, language, currency)
```

**Crucially, this example assumes the `AliPromoCampaign` class has been appropriately defined and provides the necessary setup for your campaign management.**  The `AliCampaignEditor` class is likely to inherit many methods and attributes from `AliPromoCampaign` for handling campaign-specific tasks.

**Important Next Steps:**

The `...` within the `AliCampaignEditor` class and its `__init__` method indicate substantial missing parts. You'll need to:

* **Complete the `AliCampaignEditor` class:** Define the methods and attributes that actually implement campaign editing.  This includes methods for loading existing campaigns, updating campaign attributes, saving changes, and performing any other operations needed.
* **Fill in the missing parameters within the `AliCampaignEditor` class and the `AliPromoCampaign` class.  Crucially, the `super().__init__` call in the `__init__` method must correctly pass necessary parameters and call the `__init__` of the parent class.
* **Implement `AliPromoCampaign` functionalities:** Make sure that `AliPromoCampaign` properly handles the campaign lifecycle including loading, saving, and potentially interacting with external APIs or databases.
* **Provide examples of how to use the methods:**  Add examples that demonstrate how to modify campaign attributes, generate affiliated products, extract product IDs, and any other crucial campaign-editing actions.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have a comprehensive usage guide for `AliCampaignEditor`.
