**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Mock Files:**  Crucially, fixtures like `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` are used to create temporary directories with the necessary mock files.  This isolates the tests from the real file system and avoids needing to modify files in the real project directory.  The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used for this. This is essential for testing, especially when dealing with file I/O.


2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive, e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests covering:
   - Valid input (correct file found)
   - Invalid input (file not found)
   - Edge cases (marker files in different relative paths)
   - Exception handling (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError)
   - Different paths for marker files
   - project root is already in sys.path
   - README.MD file is not found

4. **`pytest.raises` (and Mock files):**  Since the file I/O can throw exceptions, handling these exceptions is now correctly covered. The `mock_settings_file` fixture simplifies handling of invalid JSON by creating a valid settings file.  It correctly asserts if the file is not found or contains invalid JSON.

5. **Import Statements:** Added necessary imports for `json`, `Version`, etc.

6. **`tmp_path`:**  Used the `tmp_path` fixture correctly, so temporary files are cleaned up automatically after the test.

7. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each test.

8. **Correct Assertion:** Now the assertion for the `set_project_root` function checks whether it returns the expected path.

9. **Coverage of `__root__` Variable:** The tests now verify the appropriate handling of the `__root__` variable within the function. This is important because the function modifies a global variable (`sys.path`).


This improved solution is much more robust and effective for testing the `set_project_root` function in a production environment. Remember to install the necessary packages (`packaging`, `pytest`) if you haven't already.  You can run the tests using `pytest`. Also, consider adding tests for different scenarios based on the specific requirements of your project. Note that the initial code did not contain the necessary imports.
