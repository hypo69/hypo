# Add more test cases as needed for other scenarios in the login function.

# Also, add more realistic (but still testable) inputs.

# included some specific API interactions:
# def test_login_with_incorrect_api_response(mocker):
#   """Tests login with incorrect API response."""
#   # Assuming a mocked API response in the login function
#   mocker.patch('your_module.your_api_function', return_value={'status': 'failed'})
#   with pytest.raises(APIError) as excinfo:
#     login("user", "pass")
#   assert "API error" in str(excinfo.value)



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are now descriptive, clearly indicating the test scenario (e.g., `test_login_valid_credentials`).

2. **Valid/Invalid Input:** Tests now include cases for both valid and invalid (e.g., missing fields, empty strings) inputs to cover various scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases:** The added `test_login_empty_username`, `test_login_empty_password`, etc., explicitly address edge cases.

4. **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test for expected exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) with specific error messages asserted.  Crucially, the example for incorrect API responses demonstrates how to mock external API calls.

5. **Robust Error Messages:** Assertions now verify that the error messages from `login` function contain the expected string values, which is essential for accurate error detection.

6. **Realistic Placeholders:** The `username` and `password` placeholders are now more appropriate, making the tests easier to run.

7. **Missing `login` Function:** The code now has placeholder comments to indicate the need for the actual `login` function.  This is crucial. **Without the actual `login` function, you cannot run these tests. Replace the placeholder comments with the actual implementation from `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/login.py`**

8. **Import Statement:** The `from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.scenarios import login` statement ensures that the tests can correctly access the `login` function.

9. **Mocking (Example):** The commented-out example shows how to test external dependencies (like APIs) using `mocker`. This is highly recommended for testing functions that interact with external services, databases, or other APIs.


**Before running these tests:**

* **Replace the placeholder comments** in the `login` function with the actual code from `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/login.py`.
* **Install pytest:** If you don't have it already, run `pip install pytest`.


This improved solution provides a more comprehensive and robust set of tests that cover a wider range of scenarios and exception handling within the `login` function. Remember to replace the placeholder values for `username` and `password` with actual valid and invalid credentials for your testing environment. Remember to adapt and expand the test suite as needed for more complex requirements.
