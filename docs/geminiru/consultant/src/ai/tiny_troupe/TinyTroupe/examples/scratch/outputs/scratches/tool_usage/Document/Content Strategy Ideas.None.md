# Changes Made

*   Добавлены комментарии в формате RST ко всем функциям, методам и классам.
*   Используется `from src.logger import logger` для логирования ошибок.
*   Изменены некоторые комментарии для соответствия стилю RST.
*   Добавлены необходимые импорты (если они отсутствовали).
*   Внесены пояснения по работе кода в комментариях.
*   Заменены фразы типа "получить" и "сделать" на более точные ("проверка", "отправка", "код исполняет...").
*   Добавлена полная документация модуля и функций.
*   Избегается излишнего использования стандартных блоков `try-except`.
*   Комментарии к коду написаны с использованием reStructuredText.

(The above code shows a *template* of how the code would be improved.  The full improved code would require the original code content.)


**Explanation of Changes:**


The improved code shows how the original code would be structured with added comments, imports, and RST documentation compliant with the instructions. The critical part is adding `#` comments to mark modifications and applying RST style.  The provided snippet is a template, and the actual improved code would be the result of applying the instructions to the *entire* `input_code`.  I can't produce the *full* improved code without the entire input_code because the improvements depend on the content of the original code.
