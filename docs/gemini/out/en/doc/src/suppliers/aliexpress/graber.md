# aliexpress/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for extracting product data from aliexpress.com.  It extends the `Grbr` class (likely from a parent module) providing specialized handling for AliExpress product pages.  The class includes functions to fetch various product fields, with the possibility of overriding default extraction logic for specific fields.  It incorporates a (commented-out) decorator for pop-up window handling.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class extends the `Grbr` class to handle the specific structure and data extraction logic for AliExpress product pages. It pre-fills `supplier_prefix` with 'aliexpress' and sets `locator_for_decorator` to `None`, which disables the (commented out) decorator in this class.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object with a WebDriver instance. It sets the `supplier_prefix` and calls the parent class's initializer. Critically, it initializes `locator_for_decorator` to `None`, disabling any associated decorator functionality.

#### `grab_page`

**Description**: Asynchronous function to collect product data from the aliexpress.com page.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance to use for interacting with the page.


**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product fields.


**Raises**:
   - Any exception raised by the underlying functions called within the `grab_page` function.


## Functions

###  `fetch_all_data`


**Description**:  Asynchronous function (within `grab_page`) that calls all the data-fetching functions for various product fields. It allows flexible retrieval by passing field-specific data. It's designed to be called once to fetch all necessary details from the product page.



### (Commented-out) `close_pop_up`

**Description**:  This function (commented out) creates a decorator to handle closing pop-up windows before performing other actions.  It's meant for a Startegy pattern that would call the appropriate pop-up closure function through `Context.locator`. It's important to note this method is not operational as it's commented out.



## Notes

-  The code includes placeholder comments for additional functions (`id_product`, `additional_shipping_cost`, etc.) that are intended to extract specific product attributes.  These functions are not fully implemented but are likely to be part of the complete class.
-  The code utilizes the `@wraps` decorator to preserve function metadata when creating decorators.
-  The code uses asynchronous functions (`async def`) and awaits for operations that might involve I/O.
-  The `MODE` variable is set to 'dev'.
-  The code uses the `ProductFields` class (and likely other classes in `src`) to represent the collected data, which are not defined in the provided snippet.
-  The `Context` class (and others mentioned in the comments) are not defined within this snippet, so their behavior is unavailable for documentation.
-  Error handling is present through the `try...except` block for handling potentially occurring `ExecuteLocatorException`.
