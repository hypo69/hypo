**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `tmpdir` fixture from `pytest` to create temporary files/directories for `test_train_valid_data_file` and `test_train_valid_data_dir` to avoid writing to the file system for each test.
2. **Error Handling:** `test_train_no_data_raises_exception` tests the exception raised when no data is provided, and I've added a `test_train_invalid_data_type` to show the proper way of testing exceptions for invalid inputs.  The `train` function is modified to raise a `ValueError` when no data is provided. 
3. **Clearer Test Names:**  Improved test names to clearly indicate the purpose of each test.
4. **Placeholder Functions:** Created placeholder functions (`_test`, `_archive`, `_select_dataset`, etc.) for `!test`, `!archive`, etc.,  as the actual implementation is not provided.  This is crucial for testing functions that you don't have complete control over.
5. **Mock data:**  `test_test` now uses a placeholder `_test` function, which returns a string. A more robust implementation would use `mock` or other mocking tools to simulate the actual functionality if applicable.
6. **`assert` statements:**  Added `assert` statements to verify the expected output of the various commands.
7. **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing in `test_train_no_data_raises_exception`

**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the code above (e.g., as `test_bot_commands.py`).
2. Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_bot_commands.py`


This revised solution is more complete, robust, and demonStartes better test-writing practices for a real-world Python project. Remember to replace the placeholder functions with the actual implementations of the commands from the provided code for the complete solution.
