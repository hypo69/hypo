How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/locators/version.py` module

This module, `version.py`, defines various variables related to its version, name, documentation, details, annotations, and author.  It's designed to be part of a larger codebase and likely serves as a metadata source.  Crucially, this module is intended to *not* be run directly, but rather imported into other parts of the codebase.  Trying to run it as a script will produce no meaningful output.

**Key Variables and Their Use:**

* **`__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"`:** This string stores the version number of the module.  It's crucial for tracking updates and ensuring compatibility with other parts of the project.  It's often used in version control systems like Git and in package management systems (like pip).

* **`__name__`:** This variable is a string.  When the module is imported, `__name__` will contain the module's name (`"suppliers.hb.locators.version"`) or, if the file is executed directly (which is *not* recommended), `"__main__"`.

* **`__doc__`:** A string, this docstring provides documentation about the module. In this example, it appears empty, which is not ideal.  A well-formatted docstring is highly recommended for clarity.  The `.. module:` and other comments at the beginning of the file suggest the intention to utilize Sphinx or a similar tool for generating documentation.

* **`__details__ = "Details about version for module or class"`:**  Stores details specific to the module's version, e.g., features, bug fixes, or any other relevant information.

* **`__annotations__`:**  This variable is currently empty. In a real-world scenario, it would hold type hints (annotations) for variables and functions within the module, making the code more robust and readable by helping the interpreter understand variable types and function parameters.

* **`__author__ = 'hypotez '`:**  This string contains the author's name.  The space at the end of this string is unusual and should be removed for better readability.

**How to Import and Use:**

```python
import hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.locators.version

print(hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.locators.version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.locators.version.__name__)   # Output: (module name - usually, avoid direct use)
# ... or access other attributes as needed
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Avoid running this file directly:**  The `#!` lines at the top indicate intended use with a virtual environment.  These are likely to be used for specifying the correct Python interpreter.  Running the file directly as a script is generally not intended.

* **Docstrings and Comments:** Improve the documentation by writing clear and comprehensive docstrings and comments to make the code more self-explanatory.  The presence of Sphinx docstring conventions (e.g., `.. module:`).

* **Type Hinting (`__annotations__`):** Add type hints to increase code clarity and robustness. This is a best practice.

* **File Structure:** The file path is quite long. Ensure that the structure is appropriate for your project's directory layout.  Consider if there's a better way to organize the module.


This guide provides a basic understanding of the module's purpose and usage.   A more practical implementation will need comprehensive documentation and type hinting to ensure proper integration within a larger project.
