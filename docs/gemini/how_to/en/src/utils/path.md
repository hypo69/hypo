How to use the `get_relative_path` function in `hypotez/src/utils/path.py`

This function, located in `hypotez/src/utils/path.py`, takes a full path and a relative starting point, and returns the portion of the path relative to that starting point.  It's useful for constructing paths within your project.

**Function Signature:**

```python
def get_relative_path(full_path: str, relative_from: str) -> Optional[str]:
```

**Parameters:**

* `full_path` (str): The full path to the file or directory.  This should be a string, representing an absolute path.
* `relative_from` (str): The segment of the path from which the relative path should be calculated.  This is a part of the path, not a full path in itself.

**Return Value:**

* `Optional[str]`: The relative path starting from `relative_from`, as a string.  Returns `None` if the `relative_from` segment is not found within the `full_path`.


**Example Usage:**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.path import get_relative_path

# Example absolute path
full_path = "/home/user/project/data/processed_data/file.txt"

# Segment to calculate relative path from
relative_from = "data"

# Get the relative path
relative_path = get_relative_path(full_path, relative_from)

# Check if the segment was found.
if relative_path:
    print(f"Relative path from '{relative_from}': {relative_path}")
else:
    print(f"Segment '{relative_from}' not found in {full_path}")
```

**Explanation and Key Points:**

1. **Input Validation (Implicit):** The function implicitly validates the input `full_path`.  It converts it to a `pathlib.Path` object which handles potential issues with path formats.  However, you should still validate inputs based on your system.

2. **`Pathlib` Usage:** The code utilizes `pathlib.Path` for more robust path manipulation. This makes the code more versatile and less error-prone than using string manipulation alone.

3. **Error Handling:** The function returns `None` if the specified `relative_from` segment is not found in the `full_path`.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior and errors when dealing with missing parts of a path.

4. **`as_posix()`:** The `as_posix()` method converts the `pathlib.Path` object back to a platform-independent string representation. This is essential for compatibility across different operating systems.

**How to use in different scenarios:**

* **Finding a file relative to the project root:** If your `relative_from` is a directory inside your project, you can use this function to construct paths to files and directories within that part of the project.
* **Handling different file systems:** `pathlib` is platform-agnostic, so the function works the same way on Windows, macOS, and Linux, simplifying deployment across different operating systems.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling (Recommendations):** Consider adding more robust error handling for invalid `full_path` values (e.g., non-existent paths, improperly formatted strings).
* **Project Structure:** Ensure that `relative_from` is part of the correct project directory structure. If not, the output will not reflect the expected path relationships.
