**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes `pytest.raises` for testing exception handling when `hypotez` isn't found.  This is crucial for robust tests.
2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez`).
3. **Data Simulation:** The `test_root_path_calculation` and `test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez` now use `os.chdir` to create controlled testing scenarios, making the tests more reliable and independent. This is critical when testing path-related functions because the current working directory (`getcwd`) can be different in various parts of the program's execution, and you want to test that the function works *regardless* of that dynamic context.
4. **Preservation of Original State:** `test_root_path_append_to_sys_path` now correctly saves and restores the original `sys.path` using slicing `[:]` .  Modifying `sys.path` directly in a test can have unintended side effects in subsequent tests.
5. **`ValueError` Handling:** An appropriate `ValueError` is now raised when `hypotez` isn't found, and this exception is properly caught with `pytest.raises`.
6. **Mocking/Faking (optional):** For more complex scenarios, consider using mocking libraries like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to isolate the path handling from external dependencies (like the operating system).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved test suite covers a broader range of cases and is more robust than the previous version. Remember to adapt the path calculations and `ValueError` assertions based on the actual directory structure where you're running the tests.  Also ensure the test directory structure reflects the structure in your application.  If `hypotez` is not actually in the current directory, the tests will fail, as expected.   Remember to add the appropriate directory structure for the test `test_dir` before running the tests.
