**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` and `mock` to prevent the tests from modifying the actual file system.  This is essential for isolated and reliable testing.

2. **Edge Case:** The `test_dir_root_calculation_no_hypotez` function addresses the scenario where 'hypotez' isn't found in the current working directory, which will cause an error in the original code. This is a critical edge case.

3. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific about the expected paths and values, improving readability and maintainability.

4. **`globals()`:**  Uses `globals()`, which is essential to correctly modify the variables within the `header.py` module, which will have values assigned within the tests.  This was missing in the previous response and was crucial for the `test_dir_src_calculation`.

5. **Restoration of `sys.path`:**  The `original_path` and `sys.path[:] = original_path` lines are added to restore the original `sys.path` after each test, to avoid side effects on other tests.

6. **Test `test_sys_path_appending`:** Now correctly checks if the paths are appended to `sys.path` based on the values assigned in the module (`header.py`).

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_header.py`.


This improved solution addresses the critical issues and provides much more robust and reliable testing. Remember to adjust the mock paths to match your actual file structure if needed. Note that testing the appending to `sys.path` is complex because Python's module loading is involved. This test verifies the assignments of the global variables `dir_root` and `dir_src`. This is the closest you can get without actually running the module loading mechanism.
