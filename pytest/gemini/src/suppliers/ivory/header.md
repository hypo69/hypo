**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs`:**  The original code relies on a `gs` module that is not defined in the provided code. The test now mocks `gs` to avoid needing it for the `set_project_root` tests.  This is crucial for writing isolated tests.
* **`tmp_path` fixture:**  Instead of hardcoding paths, the `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories for tests. This ensures tests don't interfere with each other's files.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Edge Case Testing:**  Added tests for cases where only one marker file exists, or multiple marker files are in the same directory,  in addition to the basic cases.
* **`pytest.raises` (No Longer Needed):** The original code's exception handling is now tested by ensuring `settings` is `None` when the file doesn't exist rather than using `pytest.raises`. This approach is cleaner.
* **Comprehensive `settings` Loading Test:** The test for `settings` loading now correctly handles the case where the `settings.json` file is not found.
* **Parametrization:** Uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` for better organization and readability when testing different input combinations.


This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous response and provides more comprehensive, isolated, and maintainable tests. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pytest`, `packaging`, `unittest.mock`.  If `gs` is a real module in your project, you need to adapt the mocking portion to your specific setup.
