```

**Changes Made**

* Added a module-level docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format.  This describes the purpose of the module.
* Added `from src.logger import logger`. This is crucial for proper logging in a production environment.
* Removed unnecessary `#!` shebang lines as they are often platform-specific and potentially problematic.
* Added `TODO` item to indicate potential improvements for future development.
