**Explanation of Improvements and Fixes:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes comprehensive `try...except` blocks. This is *critical* for robustness.  It catches potential issues like:
   - Problems initializing the webdriver (e.g., browser not found, network issues).
   - `FileNotFoundError`: If the JSON file doesn't exist.
   - `json.JSONDecodeError`: If the JSON file has invalid format.
   - Errors during campaign promotion.

2. **Explicit JSON Handling:**  Crucially, the code now correctly loads JSON data. It handles potential errors during loading and decoding.  It assumes your `katia_homepage.json` files contain data needed by the `FacebookPromoter`.

3. **`exit(1)`:**  The `exit(1)` statements are crucial. They provide a more reliable way to signal that an error happened in the program.  This is *essential* for scripts used by other parts of a system.  A non-zero exit code tells the calling program something went wrong.

4. **Import `json`:** Added the `import json` line.

5. **Filepath:** Using f-strings to construct the filepaths, making the code more maintainable and reducing errors.

6. **Error Logging:**  Uses `logger.exception` to provide detailed error information to the log file, crucial for debugging.


**How to use:**

- **Ensure `header.py`, `src.webdriver.py`, `src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.promoter.py`, and `src.logger.py` exist** and contain the necessary functions and classes.

- **Correct `katia_homepage.json`:** The `katia_homepage.json` files must be properly formatted JSON containing the data the `FacebookPromoter` expects.

- **Run the script:** Execute the updated Python file. If there are errors, they'll be logged to your program's log file.


This significantly improved version is much more robust and provides useful error messages for debugging. Always include error handling when writing production-level code. Remember to configure your logging system (`src.logger`) to write to the desired output (e.g., a file). Remember that `katia_homepage.json` files need to exist in the correct location for the code to work.
