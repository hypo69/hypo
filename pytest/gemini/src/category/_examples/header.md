**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`dir_root_fixture`:** A fixture is crucial for isolating the test from the potentially problematic `os.getcwd()` call. This ensures the test runs reliably, regardless of the current working directory.

2. **`test_dir_root_path`:** This test now directly verifies the type and existence of the `dir_root` path, making the test more robust.

3. **`test_sys_path_append_correct`:** This test explicitly checks if the calculated `dir_root` path is correctly added to `sys.path`.

4. **`test_sys_path_append_redundant`:** This addresses the redundant append.  Crucially, it uses a `try...except` block to ensure that the redundant append doesn't raise an exception.  Without an expected outcome (specific impact of the redundant append) it doesn't check for a particular outcome.

5. **`test_print_dir_root`:** This test directly addresses the `print(dir_root)` line. Critically, it handles possible exceptions during printing, avoiding test failure due to unexpected errors.

6. **`test_import_src_modules`:**  This is a placeholder test; you *must* add tests for the functions and classes (`gs`, `Supplier`, etc.) that are imported.  Import errors often arise from issues with the file structure or module setup.  This test is designed to catch those problems at the import level.

7. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  The tests now use `pytest.fail` to provide informative error messages if a test fails due to an exception, significantly improving debugging.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Crucially, you need to replace the placeholder `test_import_src_modules` and add tests verifying the functionality of the imported modules (`gs`, `Supplier`, etc.).  This is the most important step, as these are the functions that are actually being tested.**  The current example verifies only the file and path handling aspects of the code provided.  Without tests for the specific functionality of the functions/classes, the tests remain incomplete. Remember to adapt the tests to match the actual function signatures, parameter types, and expected outputs of your code.
