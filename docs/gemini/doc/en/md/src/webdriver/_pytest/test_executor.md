# Module: hypotez/src/webdriver/_pytest/test_executor.py

## Overview

This module contains pytest tests for the `ExecuteLocator` class, which is responsible for interacting with web elements using a web driver.  The tests cover various scenarios, including finding elements, getting attributes, sending messages, and handling cases where elements are not found.  Mocks are extensively used to isolate the testing of the `ExecuteLocator`'s logic from the actual web driver implementation.

## Fixtures

### `driver_mock`

**Description**: A fixture that returns a `MagicMock` object representing a web driver. This mock object is used to simulate the web driver's behavior during testing, allowing the testing of `ExecuteLocator` without needing an actual web driver.

**Returns**:
- `MagicMock`: A mock object representing the web driver.


### `execute_locator`

**Description**: A fixture that creates an instance of the `ExecuteLocator` class with the provided `driver_mock` as its dependency.

**Parameters**:
- `driver_mock`: The mock object representing the web driver.

**Returns**:
- `ExecuteLocator`: An instance of the `ExecuteLocator` class using the provided `driver_mock`.


## Functions

### `test_get_webelement_by_locator_single_element`

**Description**: Tests the `get_webelement_by_locator` method when a single element is found by the given locator.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `WebElement`: The found web element if one is found.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that the returned value is the mocked web element.


### `test_get_webelement_by_locator_multiple_elements`

**Description**: Tests the `get_webelement_by_locator` method when multiple elements are found by the given locator.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `list[WebElement]`: A list of found web elements.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that the returned value is the list of mocked web elements.


### `test_get_webelement_by_locator_no_element`

**Description**: Tests the `get_webelement_by_locator` method when no element is found by the given locator.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `bool`: `False` if no element is found.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that the returned value is `False`.


### `test_get_attribute_by_locator`

**Description**: Tests the `get_attribute_by_locator` method.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `str`: The value of the specified attribute.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that the mocked `WebElement.get_attribute` is called once with the correct attribute name.
- Asserts that the returned value matches the expected value.


### `test_send_message`

**Description**: Tests the `send_message` method with default `typing_speed` and `continue_on_error`.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `bool`: `True` if the message was sent successfully.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that the mocked `WebElement.send_keys` is called once with the message.
- Asserts that the returned value is `True`.


### `test_send_message_typing_speed`

**Description**: Tests the `send_message` method with a specific `typing_speed`.

**Parameters**:
- `execute_locator`: An instance of `ExecuteLocator`.
- `driver_mock`: The mock driver object.

**Returns**:
- `bool`: `True` if the message was sent successfully.

**Assertions**:
- Asserts that `driver_mock.find_elements` is called once with the correct locator.
- Asserts that `WebElement.send_keys` is called the correct number of times.
- Asserts that `time.sleep` is called with the specified `typing_speed`.
- Asserts that the returned value is `True`.
