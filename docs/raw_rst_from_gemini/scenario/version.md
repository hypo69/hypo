```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the script won't crash. It prints a warning, which is better than a silent failure.  Consider raising an exception if the error is serious enough to halt the program.
* **Variable Names:**  Python uses snake_case for variable names (e.g., `__version__`).  The code has been updated to use snake_case where appropriate.
* **Docstrings:**  You should add a docstring to the module itself (the multiline string at the top).
* **Explicit Type Hinting:** The type hints (`settings: dict = None`) are good practice; type hints help static analysis tools and IDEs understand your code better.


**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez Project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://www.anotherlink.com"
}
```

**How to use this in other parts of your project:**

```python
from scenario import version

print(version.__project_name__)
print(version.__version__)
```

This revised version is more robust, follows best practices, and is easier to maintain and debug.  It's vital to gracefully handle potential errors when reading external configuration files. Remember to put `settings.json` in the correct location relative to your `version.py` file.
