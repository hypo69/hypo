**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `example_project_root` and `example_file` fixtures to create temporary directories and files for testing different scenarios. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding side effects.
* **Edge Cases:** Added a test case (`test_set_project_root_file_not_found`) to check the behavior when no marker file is found in the expected locations, which is crucial for robustness. Also, improved the test cases to cover edge cases of marker files not being in the root directory and files being in different locations within the project.
* **Error Handling:** Added a test case (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`) to verify the function handles the scenario where no marker files are passed.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive to indicate the purpose of each test.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Used `pytest.raises` for testing the expected `FileNotFoundError`.
* **Cleanup:** A `cleanup_tmp_dir` fixture is included to ensure that the temporary directory is removed after the tests, preventing test failures.
* **Mock:** A `patch` is used to correctly simulate `__file__` for the test case `test_set_project_root_current_directory`, mimicking the scenario where `header.py` might not be in the root folder.
* **Robustness:** The `test_set_project_root_file_not_in_root` test now correctly simulates the scenario where the current file `header.py` might not exist within the directory tree expected to be searched.  This handles the actual error that would be raised in the function if it tried to access the nonexistent `__file__` attribute.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and effectively tests the `set_project_root` function with various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling, making it more reliable. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, `mock` (or the equivalent `unittest.mock` if you don't want `pytest-mock`). You'll also need to adjust the imports to match the actual location of `hypotez` and `gs`.
