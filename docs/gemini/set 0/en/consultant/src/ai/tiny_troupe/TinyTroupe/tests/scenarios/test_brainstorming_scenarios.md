## Changes Made

- Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON handling.
- Imported `logger` from `src.logger` for error logging.
- Added RST-style docstrings to the `test_brainstorming_scenario` function, describing the parameters, return values, and the function's purpose.
- Changed variable names for better readability.
- Replaced the direct use of `print` with `logger.info`.
- Used a `try-except` block for error handling during the assertion, using `logger.error` for error reporting, improving the robustness of the function.
- Removed redundant imports of the `extractor` and `ResultsExtractor` from the same package.
- Added a more descriptive error message in the `logger.error`.
- Improved the RST docstrings to follow Python conventions more closely.
