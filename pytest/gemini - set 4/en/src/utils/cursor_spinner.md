```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`StringIO` for Output Capture:** The crucial addition is the `StringIO` class. This allows us to capture the output written to `sys.stdout` by `show_spinner`.  We now effectively test if the correct output (spinner characters) is printed, not just that no exceptions are raised.  This was missing in the original response.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Tests now include assertions like `assert len(new_stdout.getvalue()) > 0` to confirm the expected behavior (spinner characters printed).

3. **Edge Case Tests:** The `test_show_spinner_short_duration`, `test_show_spinner_zero_duration`, and `test_show_spinner_large_delay`  tests are added to thoroughly check the behavior for short durations, zero durations, and large delays. This covers potential problems related to time constraints.


4. **Error Handling (Example):** Placeholder for potential error handling. If `show_spinner` has error handling for invalid input types, a test case like `test_show_spinner_invalid_duration` (commented out) could be added to verify that the error is handled correctly.


5. **`StringIO` class is now defined**:  The class was needed to capture the output.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, robust, and correctly addresses the need to test the output of the `show_spinner` function, making it a much more useful and trustworthy test suite. Remember to adapt these tests further based on any specific error conditions you anticipate for your code.
