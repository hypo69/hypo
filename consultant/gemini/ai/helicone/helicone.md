    It handles tasks such as initializing connections, making API calls, and potentially
    managing Helicone-related resources within the application.

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:** Added a more descriptive module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the module and its functionality.  Crucially, this docstring now includes the phrase "consider environment variables or a configuration file".  This is vital for security.
* **Error Handling:** Included `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during Helicone API initialization and interactions.  This prevents the script from crashing if the API key is invalid or if there's a problem contacting the API.  It also prints informative error messages.
* **API Key Handling:** The code now demonstrates how to get the API key from an environment variable (`HELICONE_API_KEY`). This is a much better practice than hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code.  If the variable is not set, it prints an error and exits gracefully.
* **`initialize_helicone_client` Function:** Created a dedicated function to encapsulate the initialization process, making the code more modular and readable.
* **Example Usage:** Added `example_usage` function which includes example calls to the Helicone API, including `client.get_endpoints()` and `client.get_endpoint()`.  It uses placeholder values that you should replace with your endpoint ID.  This demonstrates how to use the client and properly interact with the API, providing context.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** The example code is now run only when the script is executed directly, preventing accidental execution of the example code if the module is imported into another script.
* **Import `os`:** Added `import os` to access environment variables.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Install the `helicone` library:**  You'll need to install the Helicone client library.  Assuming you have pip installed, use the following command (assuming it is in PyPI):
```bash
pip install helicone
```

2.  **Set the API Key:**  Set the `HELICONE_API_KEY` environment variable.  This is crucial for security.  On Windows, you can do this in the environment variables of your system.  On other OSs, check your respective system documentation.

3.  **Run the script:**
```bash
python helicone.py
```

This improved code is significantly more robust, secure, and demonstrates proper usage of the `helicone` library.  Remember to replace placeholders like `"your_endpoint_id"` with the actual endpoint ID from your Helicone account.  Never commit sensitive data like API keys directly into your code.
