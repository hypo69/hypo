```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Modules:** Correctly imports `Context` from the `graber.py` file, along with needed modules.

2. **Dummy `Driver`:**  Crucially, a `DummyDriver` class is introduced to mock the `Driver` object.  This is essential for testing the `Graber` class without depending on an actual web driver setup, which can be resource-intensive and unreliable in test environments.


3. **Parameterized Tests:** Added a `pytest.mark.parametrize` test to check for different types of input for the `driver` parameter, and use `pytest.raises` to confirm the correct exception handling.

4. **Mocking `logger`:** The `@patch('src.logger.logger')` decorator is used to mock the logger, so your tests don't depend on actually writing to a file or console.

5. **Clearer Test Case Structure:** The tests are more structured, with comments explaining the purpose of each test and what assertions are expected.


6. **Example Tests:** Demonstrates how to test a method (`test_graber_method_example`).  You'll need to replace placeholders like `graber.some_method()` with actual method calls and the appropriate assertions for the expected outcomes.


7. **Decorator Testing:** Shows how to test the `@close_pop_up` decorator if it exists.


8. **Exception Handling Testing:**  Includes a `test_graber_exception_handling` function showing the proper way to test exception handling, essential in real-world scenarios.




**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Change the example method names (`some_method`, `some_method_that_might_raise_an_error`) with the actual method names from your `graber.py` file.  Crucially, replace the placeholder assertions with actual assertions about the expected behavior of those methods.

2. **Add More Tests:** Write more test functions for other methods, error handling, and edge cases in the `Graber` class, focusing on different possible scenarios for inputs and expected outcomes.

3. **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests:  `pytest -v` or `pytest -s` in your terminal, ensuring that you have the `pytest` library installed (`pip install pytest`).


**Crucial:** Replace `DummyDriver` with a proper driver implementation if you have access to one (e.g., Selenium WebDriver) to make the tests more realistic and less prone to issues in edge cases.   If there are methods in `graber.py` that interact with external services, use appropriate mock objects for those interactions.
