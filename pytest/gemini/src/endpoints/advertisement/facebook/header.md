```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function for testing the `settings` and `doc_str` loading. This allows testing without creating or modifying actual files.  Crucially, it mocks `gs.path.root` to control where the files are "located" during testing.

2. **Clearer Tests:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_settings_file_exists`, `test_settings_file_not_found`).

3. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where the `settings.json` file doesn't exist and for cases where the JSON is invalid.

4. **Error Handling:** The tests now properly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **Fixture for `gs`:** A `mock_gs_path_fixture` is introduced to correctly mock the `gs.path` object, ensuring that `gs.path.root` returns the expected path during testing.  The `monkeypatch` approach ensures that the mock works correctly within the `set_project_root` and other functions.

6. **File Creation and Deletion:** Uses `tmpdir` from `pytest` to create temporary directories and files for testing `set_project_root`, making the tests more robust.

7. **Import Fixes:** Includes `from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook import set_project_root`, etc.

8. **Correct `__file__`:**  The `__file__` access now works correctly within the context of testing.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2.  Replace `MOCK_SRC_DIR` and `MOCK_GS_MODULE` with the actual paths to your "src" directory and the location of your `gs` module if they are different.
3.  Replace  `__file__` with `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` where appropriate.
4.  Run `pytest` in the same directory as your test file.

This revised solution provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests. Remember to adapt the paths to your actual project structure.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs` Module:** The solution assumes `gs` exists and has an attribute `.path`.  If your code is using a different module/structure for this path management, you will need to adjust the mocking accordingly.

* **File Content:** The `SETTINGS_JSON` is used to provide sample data. Modify this as needed to test different scenarios.

* **Absolute Paths:** The code now uses pathlib for consistency. The approach avoids issues with relative paths during testing, especially in cases where the test runs from a different directory than the source code.
