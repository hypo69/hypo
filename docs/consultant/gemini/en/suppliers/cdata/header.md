**Changes Made**

- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for file reading.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Wrapped file reading in `try-except` blocks and log specific errors, avoiding generic exceptions.
- Changed `__root__` variable to `PROJECT_ROOT` for better readability and consistency with other variables.
- Added docstrings (using reStructuredText) to the `get_project_root` function and other functions/variables.
- Improved variable naming and organization for better clarity.
- Corrected the `copyright` variable name in the settings file.
- Removed redundant comments and improved style.
- Added TODO items for potential future enhancements and improvements.
