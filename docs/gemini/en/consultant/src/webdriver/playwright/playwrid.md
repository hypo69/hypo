## Changes Made

*   Added type hints (`Optional[str]`, `Dict[str, Any]`, etc.) for better code clarity and maintainability.
*   Replaced `SimpleNamespace` imports.
*   Added `try...except` blocks around JSON loading to handle potential errors gracefully.  This prevents the script from crashing if the JSON file is invalid or missing.  Critically, it logs the error to the `logger`.
*   Replaced vague comments (`# Example usage`) with more informative RST-style documentation.
*   Added missing imports (`Path`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Any`, `SimpleNamespace`).
*   Ensured compliance with RST documentation standards.
*   Used `logger.critical` for more severe errors.
*   Added `exc_info=True` in `logger.error` and `logger.critical` for better error debugging.
*   Improved error handling. Returns `None` from `_load_settings` in case of failure, allowing the caller to handle the situation appropriately.
*   Added `@property` to `current_url` to properly expose the URL as a read-only property.
