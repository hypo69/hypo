**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling.  If `os.getcwd()` didn't contain `hypotez`, the code would silently fail.  The updated `get_project_root()` function now raises a `ValueError` if the project root cannot be found, providing more informative error messages.  This is crucial for robust code.  It also includes a `try...except` block to catch potential `OSError` during file system operations.  This prevents the script from crashing unexpectedly.

* **Clarity and Readability:** Added a docstring to `get_project_root()` explaining its purpose and potential errors.  This makes the function's behavior much clearer.


* **Robustness:** The updated code now directly searches up two levels from the current directory. This approach will find the `hypotez` folder reliably, irrespective of the current working directory and potentially different project structures.


* **`Path` Object:** Now uses `Path` objects for file path manipulation instead of raw strings, which improves clarity and safety. It's better to construct and use `Path` objects to work with file paths.


* **`str()` Conversion:**  The `__root__` variable is explicitly converted to a string using `str(__root__)` before appending to `sys.path`.


**How to use:**

This improved `header.py` can be used in the rest of your project by simply importing it.  The `__root__` path will be correctly populated.  Critically, the new code is now more resistant to issues arising from different directory structures and unexpected working directories.


**Example Usage (in another file):**

```python
from goog import header

# ...other imports

project_root = header.__root__
print(project_root)  # Print the absolute path to the hypotez project root
```


This revised approach is significantly more reliable and provides valuable error handling, making the code much more robust and user-friendly. Remember to save the improved `header.py` in the `goog` directory inside your project.
