# README for `webidl-conversions`

This package provides JavaScript implementations of algorithms to convert JavaScript values according to WebIDL types.  It allows writing JavaScript functions that behave like WebIDL operations.

## Purpose

The goal is to enable code like this:

```javascript
const conversions = require("webidl-conversions");

function doStuff(x, y) {
  x = conversions["boolean"](x);
  y = conversions["unsigned long"](y);
  // ... actual algorithm code
}
```

This would mimic the behavior of a WebIDL operation:

```webidl
void doStuff(boolean x, unsigned long y);
```

## API

The package's main module exports an object where each key corresponds to a WebIDL type (e.g., `boolean`, `unsigned long`, `float`).  Invoking a method on a JavaScript value performs the WebIDL conversion.  The result is the converted JavaScript value.  Errors are thrown for invalid conversions, following WebIDL specifications.

## Status

Numeric types (including `float` as `double`) and some other types are implemented.  The list is growing, primarily to support the `html-as-custom-elements` project.  Contributions (pull requests) are welcome.

## Handling Modifiers (e.g., `Clamp`)

The implementation currently lacks explicit support for modifiers like `[Clamp]`.  A possible approach is adding an options parameter to conversion functions (e.g., `conversions["unsigned long"](x, { clamp: true })`).

## Enhancing Error Messages

Currently, error messages are basic.  More informative messages (e.g., specifying the argument and expected type) could be added to enhance debugging.


## Background

WebIDL has a distinct type system from JavaScript. Web platform specifications often define algorithms operating on WebIDL values.  However, implementations typically use an intermediate conversion step to bridge the gap between the WebIDL type system and the underlying implementation language (usually C++).  This package provides a similar conversion step within JavaScript.

**Conceptual Conversion Pipeline:**

JavaScript value → WebIDL value → JavaScript value

This effectively bridges the gap between JavaScript code and WebIDL specifications.  The package focuses on converting JavaScript values into values compatible with WebIDL operations, as represented in JavaScript.


## Considerations

While this package provides faithful emulation, it's generally recommended to avoid directly working with WebIDL types in JavaScript, as the WebIDL type system is somewhat different from the JavaScript paradigm. Consider using more straightforward and less error-prone approaches when possible.

This package is only intended for use cases where accurate WebIDL type handling is crucial, such as creating faithful implementations (or polyfills) of web platform interfaces defined in WebIDL.
