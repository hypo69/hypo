# hypotez/src/templates/header.py

## Overview

This module, `header.py`, from the `templates` directory, appears to be a utility module for setting up and managing paths, potentially for other template files or operations within a larger project.  It defines a `MODE` variable and includes imports related to paths (`pathlib`), system interaction (`sys`), and possibly Google Cloud Storage (`src.credentials`).

## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A string variable that's likely used to configure operational modes (e.g., development, production).  The value is currently set to `'dev'`.


## Functions (None defined in this file)

## Classes (None defined in this file)

## Imports

### `pathlib`

**Description**: Provides object-oriented way of working with files, paths, and directories.

### `sys`

**Description**: Module providing access to system-specific parameters and functions.  Specifically, it appears to add the project root directory to the Python import path, making modules and files within the project accessible.

### `src.credentials`

**Description**:  Likely a module containing credentials or configuration related to Google Cloud Storage (GS). The `gs` object from this module is imported.


## Global Variables

### `src_path`

**Description**: The full path to the root directory of the project. It is calculated as the path of the current file's parent's parent's parent, and appended to the python import path if it's not already present. This likely makes any modules and files in the src directory directly importable.
