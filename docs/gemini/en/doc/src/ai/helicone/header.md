# Module: hypotez/src/ai/helicone/header.py

## Overview

This module defines the root path of the project. All imports are built relative to this path.

## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory, searching upwards and stopping at the first directory containing any of the marker files.

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.  Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Returns**:

- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.

**Raises**:

- No exceptions are explicitly raised.

### `set_project_root` (Example Usage)


```python
#Example Usage
import os
root_path = set_project_root()
print(os.path.abspath(root_path))
```


## Variables

### `__root__`

**Description**: Path to the root directory of the project. Initialized by `set_project_root`.


## Notes

- This module initializes the `__root__` variable, which represents the root directory of the project.
- It also modifies `sys.path` to include the project root, ensuring correct import functionality.
- The module attempts to load settings from a `settings.json` file in the `src` directory. It handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` gracefully.
- It also attempts to load documentation from a `README.MD` file. It handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` gracefully.
