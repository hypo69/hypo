```python
import pytest

# Tests for the module (assuming no functions or classes are defined in the code other than the global variable MODE)
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks that the MODE global variable is correctly defined."""
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt import MODE
    assert MODE == 'dev'

# Example of a test that would fail if the import statement was incorrect
def test_gsheet_import():
    """Checks if GptGs class can be imported."""
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt import GptGs
    assert True # This will pass if GptGs is importable
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code snippet only defines a global variable `MODE`.  There are no functions or classes to test.  The provided example tests cover the critical aspect of checking if the variable `MODE` has the expected value.  Crucially, it imports the module to verify the existence.

* **`test_mode_value`:** This test directly accesses the `MODE` variable from the `hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt` module using `from ... import MODE`. This demonStartes how to test a simple global variable.  Importantly, it asserts that the value is indeed 'dev', as expected.


* **`test_gsheet_import`:**  This test addresses the potential import error. It attempts to import `GptGs`.   Crucially, instead of an assertion on the *content* of the class, this test validates the *ability* to import it successfully. This is often as important as, or even more important than, verifying the internal logic of the class. This test will pass if the `GptGs` class exists in the `hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt` module. If it doesn't exist, an import error occurs, and the test will fail, providing useful information in the test report.  This `assert True` is a placeholder, and would change based on how you plan to ensure that the class exists (e.g. validating a specific attribute of `GptGs`).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_chat_gpt.py`) in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/__init__.py`.
2.  Run `pytest test_chat_gpt.py` from your terminal.


**Further Test Considerations (if applicable):**


If the `__init__.py` file contains functions or classes, you'll need to add tests to cover them.  For example, if `GptGs` had methods, you would include tests verifying their functionality, valid and invalid inputs, and handling of potential exceptions.


**Example with a Hypothetical `GptGs` Class:**

```python
# In hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/__init__.py
from .gsheet import GptGs
```

```python
# In test_chat_gpt.py
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt import GptGs  # Import the class

def test_gpt_gs_method(gpt_gs_instance):
    # Assume gpt_gs_instance is a fixture
    result = gpt_gs_instance.get_data()
    assert isinstance(result, list), "Method should return a list"
```

The hypothetical example above illuStartes how you would create a fixture for use in more detailed tests.  You'd need a more comprehensive example for the class for these tests to be meaningful.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with accurate test assertions based on the actual logic of your code.
