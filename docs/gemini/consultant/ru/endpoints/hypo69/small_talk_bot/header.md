**Changes Made**

*   Added type hints to `get_project_root` function.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `jjson.j_loads` for loading JSON data.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
*   Included error handling using `logger.error` for both `settings.json` and `README.MD` file loading.
*   Used more descriptive variable names (e.g., `PROJECT_ROOT`).
*   Improved RST formatting for module and function documentation.
*   Added missing imports: `from packaging.version import Version` & `from pathlib import Path` and `from src import gs`.
*   Added comprehensive error handling using `try-except` blocks with logging.
*   Added informative error messages to logging.
*   Consistently used single quotes in Python code.
*   Added docstrings (using RST) for all functions.
*   Corrected a typo in variable name (from ``copyrihgnt`` to ``copyright``).
*   Use `PROJECT_ROOT` for consistency and clarity.
