Changes Made

- Added a module-level docstring in reStructuredText format, describing the purpose of the module.
- Added a function-level docstring in reStructuredText format for `how_to_istall_chrome_for_testing`, explaining its parameters and return value.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`, following the data handling instruction.
- Included a `try...except` block and used `logger.error` to handle potential exceptions during installation, improving error handling.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Added comments using `#` to indicate parts of the code that need completion or modification.
