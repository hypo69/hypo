**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`setup_mock_files` fixture:** Creates the necessary mock files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `src/settings.json`, `src/README.MD`) in a temporary directory, ensuring each test has its own isolated environment. This is crucial for avoiding conflicts and unexpected behavior.
* **`tmp_project_root` fixture:** This fixture now takes a `tmp_path` from `pytest` to create the temporary directory, which is much cleaner and more efficient.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.
* **Parameterization:**  Uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different marker file scenarios.
* **Edge Cases:** Tests cases for scenarios like no marker files, marker files not existing, a marker file in a subfolder, and when multiple marker files are provided.
* **Error Handling (Important):** Includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` that might occur during file reading. This is critical in production code.
* **`sys.path` test:** Ensures `sys.path` is correctly updated when the root is found.
* **Explicit Assertions:** Uses `assert` statements to check for the expected results, making the tests more readable and maintainable.
* **Reproducibility:** Ensures tests are reproducible by creating a fresh, isolated project directory for each test.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Not needed for this specific function as it doesn't raise exceptions directly (unless there is an underlying `FileNotFoundError`).

This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and adheres to the best practices for writing `pytest` tests, making it suitable for production code. Remember to install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
