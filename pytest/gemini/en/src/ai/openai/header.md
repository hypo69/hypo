**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly describe the scenario (e.g., `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`).

2. **Temporary Directory Creation:** Tests now create temporary directories to isolate the tests, avoiding interference between runs and ensuring the files are removed after.

3. **Robust `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`:** This test is more complete by checking if the path returned is the directory the file is in rather than just assuming.

4. **Multiple Parent Test:**  A new test is added to handle the case where marker files might exist in multiple parent directories.


5. **Thorough Edge Case Test:** A new test (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files_at_all`) has been added to ensure the function correctly handles the situation where *no* marker files are present at any level of the directory tree.

6. **Exception Handling:** Comments are added to indicate where exception handling tests for `settings.json` and `README.MD` would be implemented (as actual test functions, but need the file setup to be in a suitable location for testing.)

**Crucial Considerations for Full Testing:**

- **`settings.json` and `README.MD` Creation:** The code now requires a directory with a `settings.json` file for the remaining test functions. The commented-out test cases (like `test_settings_file_not_found`) must be adapted to create temporary files and/or directories, mimicking realistic file systems as part of testing. 

- **JSON Structure:** You need to define a sample `settings.json` file with valid and invalid JSON structures, covering missing keys, incorrect data types, etc.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger.py`.


Remember to adapt the commented-out exception handling tests appropriately to use `pytest.raises` and test the JSON reading and file handling of the code in question. This improved test suite addresses the important requirements for robust testing, such as handling incorrect file contents and situations with no matching files.
