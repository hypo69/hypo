**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `logger` for `test_close_pop_up_failed`, making the test more robust and avoiding external dependencies. More importantly, it uses `pytest.fixture` for mocking the `supplier_mock` and `driver` objects, enabling more controlled and isolated tests.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the scenario being tested.

* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added tests for a `None` supplier and an invalid `locator`, handling edge and invalid cases.

* **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test the expected exceptions.

* **Robustness:** The `MockDriver` class now includes methods to emulate driver behavior, making the tests more complete.

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to explain the purpose and behavior of each test function.

This revised solution significantly improves the test suite by covering a wider range of scenarios, including edge cases, exception handling, and by using mocking to isolate the tests and reduce external dependencies. This makes the tests more reliable and easier to maintain. Remember to replace `"some_locator"` with the actual locator from your `locators` dictionary.  If your locator involves finding an element, you'll need to mock the corresponding selenium methods accordingly.  Also, the specific exception you expect would need to be defined in the MockDriver accordingly.
