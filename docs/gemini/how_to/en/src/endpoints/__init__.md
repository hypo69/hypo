## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/endpoints/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/endpoints/__init__.py`, acts as an entry point for various endpoints used in the `hypotez` application. It imports modules that handle interactions with different data sources, like PrestaShop and Kazarinov.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Endpoints:**  These are the different points of interaction with external systems or data sources.  The imported modules (`PrestaShop`, `KazarinovTelegramBot`, etc.) represent these endpoints.
* **MODE:** The global variable `MODE` is likely a configuration flag, setting the operational mode (e.g., 'dev' for development, 'prod' for production).


**How to Use:**

1. **Import necessary endpoints:**  The `__init__.py` file imports specific endpoint modules (e.g., `PrestaShop`, `KazarinovTelegramBot`). This allows you to use these classes in other parts of your project.

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.endpoints import PrestaShop, KazarinovTelegramBot
   ```

2. **Instantiate endpoint objects:** To interact with an endpoint, create an instance of the corresponding class.  This likely involves providing necessary configuration information (e.g., API keys, URLs).

   ```python
   # Example (assuming PrestaShop has a constructor):
   presta_shop_instance = PrestaShop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="YOUR_BASE_URL")

   # Example (assuming KazarinovTelegramBot needs parameters)
   kaz_bot = KazarinovTelegramBot(token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")

   ```


3. **Call methods on the endpoint objects:**  Once an endpoint object is created, use its methods to perform actions.  For example:

   ```python
   #Example (assuming PrestaShop has a getProduct method)
   product_details = presta_shop_instance.getProduct(product_id=123)

   #Example (assuming KazarinovTelegramBot has a sendMessage method)
   message_sent = kaz_bot.sendMessage(chat_id=1234, text="Hello from Kazarinov Bot!")
   ```

**Example using `PriceListRequester`:**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints import PriceListRequester

requester = PriceListRequester(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", endpoint_url="YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL")
price_list = requester.request_price_list(product_id=123, date='2023-10-26')
print(price_list)
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions that might occur during interactions with the external systems.  This is crucial for production-level code.

* **Configuration:** The `__init__.py` likely imports functions to load or set configuration variables (`api_key`, `base_url`, etc.)  Ensure you have appropriate configuration files or mechanisms to provide these values.

* **Documentation:** The `""" ... """` strings within the imported modules likely contain specific details about their methods, parameters, and usage.  Review these for complete information about each endpoint.


**Next Steps:**

* Analyze the specific methods within each imported class to understand their functionality and parameters.
* Check for example usage or unit tests provided by the codebase to gain a better understanding of how these endpoints are used in practice.
* Ensure that the required configuration values are correctly set and accessible when you use these modules.


This guide provides a general overview; more detailed instructions will depend on the specifics of the implemented endpoints.
