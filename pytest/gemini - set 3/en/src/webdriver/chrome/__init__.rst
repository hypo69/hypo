**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`monkeypatch` for Testing Internal State:** The example now uses `monkeypatch` to simulate the `is_running` attribute, which is a very good practice when testing internal state.  This allows you to control the conditions of the tests.

2. **Explicit Error Messages:** The `pytest.raises` calls now include `match` arguments for more informative error messages, improving debugging if an exception isn't raised as expected.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_chrome_start_already_running`).

4. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests now include cases where the Chrome driver is already running or not running, demonstrating exception handling and testing both happy and unhappy paths.

5. **Example with Argument and Exception Handling:**  It demonstrates testing a method that takes arguments and one that raises exceptions, both of which are vital for complete testing.  Replace `"some_method"` and `"some_argument"` with the actual method name and argument for your class.


**Before Running:**

- **Replace placeholders:** Update `some_method` and `"some_argument"` with the actual names from your `Chrome` class. Replace `expected_output` with the appropriate value the method should return.
- **`Chrome` class:** Add the necessary methods to the `Chrome` class in your actual code for the tests to apply to.  The code above is assuming your `Chrome` class has methods like `start()`, `stop()`, and possibly others.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

- **Method Specific Testing:** Add more specific tests for each method in your `Chrome` class.  What are the expected inputs? Expected outputs? Expected exception types (and messages)?


This improved example provides a more robust and detailed test suite for your `Chrome` class.  Remember to adapt the tests to exactly match the behavior of the `Chrome` class in your code. Remember to install the `pytest` library (`pip install pytest`).
