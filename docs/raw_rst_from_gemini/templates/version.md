**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `print("Warning: settings.json not found or invalid. Using default values.")`.  This is crucial for robustness.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, your code won't crash.  Consider logging this using a logging library (e.g., `logging`) for more sophisticated error handling and tracking.  This is better than `...` because it provides feedback.
* **Variable Naming:**  Corrected the typo in `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.  Pythonic style generally prefers snake_case for variables, but this is more about consistency.
* **Readability:** Minor formatting improvements for better readability.
* **Clarity:**  Made it clear that `__doc__` and `__details__` should be populated by docstrings in the actual modules.  You'll probably want to use these to document aspects of your project that go beyond basic metadata.

**How to use this `version.py`:**

1. **`settings.json`:** Create a file named `settings.json` in the same directory as `version.py`.  It should contain JSON data like this:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2023 Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```

2. **In your modules:** Import the `version` module and use its attributes:

```python
import hypotez.src.templates.version as version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Logging:**  For production code, use the Python `logging` module to record errors if `settings.json` isn't found. This is much better than printing.
* **Documentation:**  Don't forget to populate `__doc__` and `__details__` strings with actual documentation within your modules using docstrings.

This revised `version.py` is more robust, readable, and ready for integration into a real project. Remember to adapt the error handling to suit your application's needs. Using `logging` is almost always a better choice for production code in Python than printing a simple message.
