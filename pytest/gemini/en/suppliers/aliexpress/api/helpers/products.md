```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the input and expected outcome.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover valid inputs, empty inputs, incorrect input types, and edge cases where a product might be missing the required field.
* **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used effectively to test exception handling, ensuring the code correctly handles invalid input types. This is crucial for robustness.
* **Specific Error Messages:** Error messages in the `pytest.raises` blocks are now more specific, helping in debugging.
* **`assert` statements for Equality:** Assertions are used correctly to compare actual and expected outputs for both `parse_product` and `parse_products`.

This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and provides more meaningful feedback during testing. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.helpers.products` with the actual path to your module if necessary. Remember to run `pytest` to execute the tests.
