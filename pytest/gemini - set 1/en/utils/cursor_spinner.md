**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`monkeypatch`:**  Crucially, I've used `monkeypatch` to avoid the spinner interfering with the test execution time. This isolates the tests from any side effects of printing to the console.  This is absolutely essential when testing functions involving `time.sleep()` and output.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more specific and descriptive, making it easier to diagnose failures.
* **Edge Cases and Invalid Input:** Tests now include tests for negative duration and invalid delay values, verifying that the code handles these cases as expected.
* **Zero Delay Test:** This test checks if the code works with a very small delay to avoid potential issues with how the time is calculated.
* **Backspace Test:** The new test confirms the backspace character is indeed used.


This revised solution addresses potential issues and provides a more robust and informative set of tests. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pytest`.  Importantly, you need to install the `hypotez` library to run the tests, if it's a separate package.  If it's not, it might be appropriate to modify the test imports to reflect the path where this code is saved.
