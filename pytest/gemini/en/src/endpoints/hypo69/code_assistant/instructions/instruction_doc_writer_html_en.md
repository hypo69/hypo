```python
import pytest

# The user-provided code is missing, so I cannot generate tests.
# Replace the following with the actual Python code to be tested.
# Example (replace with your actual code):
# def some_function(input_data):
#     # ... your function code ...
#     return result
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations**

The prompt asks for `pytest` tests, but the input code describes *how* to write documentation in HTML format for Python code.  There's no Python code provided to test.  To generate meaningful tests, I need the Python code itself.

**How to proceed:**

1. **Provide the Python Code:**  Paste the Python code you want tested into the `input_code` field, replacing the empty placeholder.

2. **Identify Functions/Methods/Classes:** Analyze the Python code to determine the functions, methods, and classes you want to test.

3. **Test Cases (Example):**  Based on the Python code, write `pytest` tests.  For instance, if you have a function like this:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return a + b
```

Then the test cases would look like this:


```python
import pytest

def test_add_numbers_positive():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
    assert add_numbers(10, 5) == 15

def test_add_numbers_zero():
  assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0

def test_add_numbers_negative():
  assert add_numbers(-2, 3) == 1
  assert add_numbers(2, -3) == -1
  
def test_add_numbers_float():
  assert add_numbers(2.5, 3.5) == 6.0  

def test_add_numbers_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        add_numbers("a", 5)  # Expect a TypeError for non-numeric input
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        add_numbers(2, "b")  # Expect a TypeError for non-numeric input
```

Remember to:

*   **Use `pytest.raises`:**  For testing exceptions.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Test boundary conditions (e.g., very large numbers, zero, negative values, floating-point numbers).  
*   **Valid/Invalid Inputs:** Test different types of inputs to make sure the functions handle various situations correctly.
*   **Clear Test Names:**  Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the test.
*   **Independent Tests:**  Ensure each test is independent of the others.


**Example with Fixtures (if applicable):**


```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


def test_function_using_fixture(sample_data):
    # Use sample_data in your test
    assert sum(sample_data) == 15
```


Replace the placeholder example with your actual Python code, and provide tests based on the logic of your functions.  Provide a more substantial input code example for me to create more comprehensive test cases.
