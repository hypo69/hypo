```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The solution now includes `mock_file_exists` to create the necessary files for testing in a controlled way, rather than relying on the real filesystem. This significantly improves test isolation.
* **Fixtures:** Dedicated fixtures (`temp_project_root`, `temp_settings_file`) create the necessary temporary directory and files, making tests more robust and reusable.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_project_root_existing_files`).
* **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests cover various scenarios, including when marker files exist, are absent, and are in different relative paths.
* **Edge Cases:**  The tests now include cases where no marker files are found. This is crucial for checking for appropriate error handling.
* **Error Handling:** The code was slightly modified to not error out if settings.json is missing.
* **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed Here):** Exception handling is implicit within the structure; pytest's failure mechanism correctly captures errors from the `json.load` or `FileNotFoundError` cases.  No need for `pytest.raises` as the test cases are designed to ensure that no exceptions are *uncaught*.


This revised solution provides a more complete and maintainable set of tests for the `get_project_root` function, covering a wider range of conditions and using `pytest` fixtures efficiently. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
