# helicone.py

## Overview

This module provides configuration and potentially other functionalities related to the Helicone AI platform.  It appears to be a starting point or configuration file for interaction with the Helicone API.  The `MODE` variable likely controls the environment (e.g., 'dev' for development, 'prod' for production).  Further details are needed from the missing `header` import.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable representing the current operational mode.  Presumably, 'dev' for development, and potentially other values for other environments.

**Value**: 'dev'


## Missing Information

The `header` import is missing from the code snippet.  This prevents a complete documentation of the module's functionality.


## Further Documentation Needed

The comments within the code snippet lack substantial documentation of the module's operation.  A detailed explanation of the module's purpose, its interaction with the Helicone AI platform, and the logic behind its implementation is essential to provide useful documentation.  Specifically, descriptions of any missing import statements are crucial to filling gaps in the understanding of the module's operation.
