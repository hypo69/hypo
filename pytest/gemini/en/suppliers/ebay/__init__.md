**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **`pytest.mark.skip`:**  The code now includes `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators for tests that rely on external data or functionalities that aren't yet implemented (`Graber` class). This prevents the tests from failing due to missing parts.  **Crucially, this is essential for testing incomplete or mocked code.**  Remove these when the `Graber` class and its methods are implemented and ready for testing.

* **Realistic Test Cases (mocked):**  The `test_graber_fetch_data_*` tests are now examples, showcasing how to test the behavior of `fetch_data` with different inputs. **You must replace placeholders like `fetch_data("some_query")` with the actual method call, and `expected_result` with the proper expected result**.  Moreover, the invalid/exception tests use `pytest.raises` correctly to verify the type of exception raised by the `Graber.fetch_data` method.

* **Clearer Comments:**  The comments in the tests explain the purpose of each test case and the specific input or expected behavior.

* **Proper `pytest` Structure:**  The tests are well-organized and follow a standard `pytest` structure.

**How to Use and Adapt:**

1.  **Implement the `Graber` class:** Add the actual implementation for the `Graber` class, including its methods (e.g., `fetch_data`).
2.  **Mock or Provide Test Data:** To run the tests, you will need to either:
    *   Provide mock data or classes to allow the test to run without external resources like real connections. Use the `pytest.fixture` decorator to create and return your mock data within the test.
    *   Use a mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to mock the external dependencies (e.g., network requests, database interactions) used by the `Graber` class.


3.  **Replace Placeholders:** Update the test cases with the correct names for the methods in the `Graber` class, valid and invalid inputs, and the correct expected results.

4.  **Run the Tests:** Run `pytest` from the command line to execute your tests.

By following these steps, you will have a complete and functional test suite for your `hypotez` code, ensuring its quality and stability. Remember to remove the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators after completing the `Graber` implementation.
