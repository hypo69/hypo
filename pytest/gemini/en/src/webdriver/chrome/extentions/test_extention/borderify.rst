**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Integration:** The code now uses Selenium to interact with the browser. This is crucial because directly interacting with the browser's DOM via JavaScript alone won't be enough for proper testing. We use `driver.execute_script()` to run the JavaScript code within the browser context.

2. **`driver_instance` Fixture:** A `pytest` fixture is used to create and manage the WebDriver instance. This is good practice for creating and disposing of resources like browser drivers properly.

3. **Error Handling:**  The code includes `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during the execution of the JavaScript code. This is vital, as unexpected errors in the JavaScript might not result in a meaningful error message.  Handling exceptions prevents tests from failing silently.

4. **Explicit Assertions:** Instead of relying solely on whether an alert was shown, we now have more explicit assertions. Checking the actual `border` style using `driver.execute_script` and comparing it directly ensures the assertion is about the expected output.

5. **Edge Cases (No Body):** A test case, `test_borderify_handles_no_body` is included to simulate a scenario where `document.body` might not be available.  Crucially, it handles exceptions in cases where the js might not be able to run correctly.

6. **Invalid Input (Illustrative):**  While the original JS code doesn't directly have invalid inputs, I've included a comment about the possibilities for more specific scenarios (`test_borderify_invalid_border_value`).  A possible test would be checking if it throws an error if it is passed an invalid border value (like "invalid").

7. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

8. **pytest.raises:**  While not needed in these specific tests (since we're checking expected output rather than exceptions), it's good practice to know how to include `pytest.raises` for error cases. I've included a placeholder comment for illustrative purposes.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
    ```
2.  Use `webdriver-manager` to download the correct ChromeDriver (or GeckoDriver for Firefox) for your Chrome version.   If you're not using a version manager (like `conda`), you'll need to download the correct driver and place it into a folder in your `PATH` variable.  Otherwise, tell pytest where to find the driver.
3.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_borderify.py`).
4.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_borderify.py
    ```


This revised solution provides a more robust and complete test suite, covering various scenarios and potential errors, which is essential for reliable web automation testing. Remember to adapt the webdriver initialization (e.g., `webdriver.Chrome()`) to the correct webdriver for your environment.
