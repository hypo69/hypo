**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_project_root` and `mock_no_project_root` fixtures to create temporary directories for testing, simulating different project structures.  Crucially, `mock_no_project_root` is now used for the `test_set_project_root_no_project_root` case.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Improved assertions to directly check for the expected return values (Path objects) and the addition of the path to `sys.path`.

3. **Edge Cases:** Added a test for an empty `marker_files` tuple to demonStarte exception handling for invalid input.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Added a `test_set_project_root_empty_marker_files` test for demonStarting the use of `pytest.raises` for checking specific exceptions.

5. **Error Handling:**  The test cases now use `pytest.raises` to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the `test_settings_loading` function, showcasing how to robustly test code that handles exceptions.  Crucially, the `@pytest.mark.skip` marker is used on the `test_settings_loading` function, because this test requires a setup (e.g., `src` directory, `settings.json` file) in your current directory to succeed.

6. **Example Test for Other Functions:**  Added a placeholder `test_settings_loading` test demonStarting how to test functions that read files, including error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.   Crucially, it now uses a `mock_settings_file` to avoid errors.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Create a directory named `./mock_project_root` and put a `pyproject.toml` file in it.
4.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

**Important:**  The `test_settings_loading` function (and potentially others) will need adjustments to work with *your* specific file structure, the presence of the `src` directory and `settings.json`, and correct instantiation of the `settings` variable.
