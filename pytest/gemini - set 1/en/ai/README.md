**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hypothetical Functions:** The code now includes example functions (`get_prompt`, `call_anthropic_api`) to demonstrate how to write tests. Replace these with your actual functions from the `ai` module.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names like `test_get_prompt_valid_input` are descriptive and easily understandable.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_get_prompt_invalid_input` and `test_call_anthropic_api_invalid_input` now use `pytest.raises` to catch specific exceptions and verify that the error handling works as expected.


4. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** Tests now include more edge cases such as an empty string input and testing with an unknown model type, which is a more realistic test of robustness.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** This is a starting point; you need to add more tests to cover all your functions, especially invalid inputs and edge cases for prompt input for different model types.  Add tests for each of the other `ai` submodule functions.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code above (as `test_ai.py` for example) in the same directory as your `ai` module.
2.  Run `pytest test_ai.py` in your terminal. pytest will automatically discover and execute the tests.

**Crucially:**  Replace the example functions with your actual functions from your `ai` module to run real tests.  This example framework will work, but you must adapt it to test your specific code.  Remember to include appropriate error handling in your actual code to match the tests.  Consider different data types for inputs, and combinations of inputs.
