# No functions or classes are defined in the provided code, so no tests can be written.
#  The file only contains comments and the constant 'MODE'.
#  Therefore, no test cases can be generated.

# Example test, showing what a test would look like if there were actual functions to test.
# def test_constant_mode():
#     assert gt.MODE == 'dev'
