**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `logging`:** The code now uses `mock_logger` to create a logger instance for testing. This is crucial because `logging` interacts with the file system and other external resources, which are not needed for unit tests.  This is a much cleaner approach for this specific test.

2. **`caplog` Fixture (Better):**  Instead of trying to directly assert on the effects of logging functions, we use `pytest.capture_log` fixture (`caplog`). This allows us to verify the output of the `logging` module without relying on side effects (which are dangerous in tests).

3. **Explicit Assertions:** The example shows how you would use `assert` statements within the test methods to check the contents of the log messages and the logging levels. The previous answer was missing these vital assertions.

4. **Robust `test_logger_no_message`:** This test checks the correct exception when no message is provided to a logging function.

5. **`test_mode_constant`:** This test checks if the `MODE` variable is defined (and has some value) at compile time, which is more practical.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Import `logger.py`:** Make sure the code from `logger.py` is available in your test environment (e.g., in the same directory or accessible via `sys.path`).

2.  **Run the tests:** Execute the test file using `pytest`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Real Logging Output:** If you need to test the *actual* logging output (e.g., writing to a file), modify the `mock_logger` fixture and introduce a method to capture and analyze the logged messages. This will depend on the specific requirements of the logging framework.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_logger_no_message` function is a good example of testing error conditions for input validation. Add tests for any potential exceptions that your logging functions might raise.
* **Level Specific Tests:** Depending on your logging implementation, you might want to create test functions for each logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). This allows you to test the behaviour of the logging system as it propagates through the various logging levels.


Remember to replace placeholders with your actual code if necessary.  The example provides a structure that you should adapt for testing the rest of the code in `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/logger.py`.
