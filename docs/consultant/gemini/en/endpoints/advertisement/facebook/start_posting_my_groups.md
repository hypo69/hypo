**Changes Made**

* **Import `json`**: Added `import json` for file handling.
* **Import `j_loads`**: Replaced `import json` with `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
* **Improved variable names**: Renamed `filenames` to `GROUP_FILE_NAMES` and `campaigns` to `CAMPAIGNS` for better readability and consistency.
* **Separated function**: Created a `start_facebook_campaign_posting` function to encapsulate the main campaign posting logic. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
* **Error Handling**: Removed the unnecessary `try-except` block. Instead, added a `finally` block to ensure the WebDriver instance is closed correctly (using `driver.quit()`).
* **Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block**:  Critically important. This ensures that the `start_facebook_campaign_posting()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).
* **Used `copy.deepcopy`**: Corrected the use of `copy.copy` to `copy.deepcopy` when creating a copy of the `CAMPAIGNS` list within the loop.  Critically important to prevent unintended side effects.
* **Docstrings (RST)**: Added comprehensive RST docstrings to the module, function, and variables for better documentation and readability.
* **Corrected `get_url`**: Corrected the `get_url` method call to use string literals instead of raw strings.
* **Removed Unnecessary Comments**: Removed extraneous comments that were not necessary for understanding the logic.
