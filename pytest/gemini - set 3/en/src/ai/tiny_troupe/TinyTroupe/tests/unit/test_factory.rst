**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** Added a test (`test_generate_person_invalid_input`) using `pytest.raises` to check for `TypeError` when the input is not a string.  It now also catches `ValueError`.  This is crucial for robust testing of the function's exception handling.

2. **Edge Case: Empty Specification:** Added `test_generate_person_empty_spec` to explicitly test for an empty string input, a common edge case.  It now raises `ValueError` which is a more correct indication of what the expected failure mode is.

3. **Parameterization for Multiple Invalid Inputs:** The `test_generate_person_invalid_input` test is now parameterized using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with a wider variety of invalid inputs. This is more efficient than writing separate tests for each.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are more descriptive, giving context about why an assertion failed.

5. **Robust `minibio` Check:** The `test_generate_person_valid_input` now checks if `minibio` is not empty, preventing a test failure if the internal function returns an empty string.

6. **Crucial Fixture (`setup`)**  The `setup` fixture is now included and correctly used in the tests. This ensures each test runs in an isolated context and doesn't rely on the state of previous tests.  However, the example setup is currently a placeholder; you need to replace the `...` with actual setup code if needed.  _If no fixture is needed, simply use `def test_X(...)` instead._

7. **Example of More Complex Setup:** I have shown how the fixture can be used in a more complex setup example.

This revised solution addresses the previously mentioned shortcomings and makes the tests more comprehensive, robust, and maintainable.  Remember to replace the placeholder `# ... (Add setup code here if necessary)` with the actual setup code from your project.  Also, ensure the `testing_utils` module (which the code relies on) is correctly imported and working.
