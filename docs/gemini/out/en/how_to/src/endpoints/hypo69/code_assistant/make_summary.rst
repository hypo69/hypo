How to use this code block
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code creates a `SUMMARY.md` file containing a list of all `.md` files within a specified directory, useful for generating a table of contents or summary in a documentation project. It uses the `mdbook` format for linking to the individual files.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module, which is used for working with file paths.

2. **Define `make_summary` function:** This function takes a `Path` object representing the source directory as input.

3. **Prepare the summary file path:** The `prepare_summary_path` function constructs the path to the `SUMMARY.md` file, replacing the `/src` part of the input path with `/docs`.  This is important for generating the correct relative links within the `SUMMARY.md` file.

4. **Create the summary file:** The `summary_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` line ensures that the parent directory of the `summary_file` is created if it doesn't already exist, preventing errors.

5. **Call the recursive helper function:** The `_make_summary` function is called to handle the recursive processing of the directory and its subdirectories.

6. **Recursive processing (`_make_summary`):**
    * **Check for existing file:** If `SUMMARY.md` already exists, a message is printed indicating that its content will be overwritten.
    * **Open the summary file for writing:** It opens the `summary_file` in write mode (`'w'`) with UTF-8 encoding.
    * **Write the header:** Writes a header to the file (`# Summary`).
    * **Iterate through .md files:** It iterates through all `.md` files within the source directory (`src_dir`) using `src_dir.rglob('*md')`.
    * **Skip SUMMARY.md:** It skips the `SUMMARY.md` file itself to prevent recursion.
    * **Generate relative paths:** It generates the relative paths for each `.md` file, starting from the `src_dir.parent` (important for linking purposes in `mdbook`).
    * **Write links to summary file:**  Writes lines of the format `- [Title]([Link])` to the `SUMMARY.md` file, where `Title` is the filename without the extension and `Link` is the relative path.
    * **Error handling:** A `try...except` block is used to catch and print any exceptions that might occur during file operations, helping with debugging.

7. **Return success:** The function returns `True` to indicate successful creation of `SUMMARY.md`.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant.make_summary import make_summary

    # Replace with the actual path to your 'src' directory
    src_directory = Path("./src")

    make_summary(src_directory)
