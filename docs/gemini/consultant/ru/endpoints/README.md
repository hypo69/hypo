**Changes Made**

1.  Added missing imports: `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` and `from src.logger import logger`.
2.  Added docstrings (using RST) to the `PrestashopAPI` class and its methods, including type hints.
3.  Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except`.  This is more robust and allows for centralized logging.
4.  Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON parsing.
5.  Added placeholders (`# ...`) for missing implementation details, crucial for a complete API.
