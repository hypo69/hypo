**Issues and Recommendations:**

1. **Missing `Locator` class:** The code defines `ExecuteLocator` but doesn't define a `Locator` class.  This is problematic because it implies `locator` can be a `dict` and a `SimpleNamespace`, but without a clear `Locator` class, there's no type safety and the code may be fragile.

   ```python
   from typing import NamedTuple

   class Locator(NamedTuple):
       """Represents a locator."""
       by: str
       selector: str
       event: Optional[str] = None
       attribute: Optional[str] = None
       mandatory: Optional[bool] = False

   ```
   This class enforces the structure expected for `locator`.

2. **Type Hinting and `Optional` use:** The code does a lot of `isinstance` checks.  Using proper type hinting with `Optional` is crucial.  For example:


   ```python
   from typing import Optional, Union, List

   # ... other imports ...
   
   @dataclass
   class ExecuteLocator:
       # ... (rest of the class)
       async def execute_locator(
           self,
           locator: Union[dict, SimpleNamespace, Locator],
           timeout: float = 0,
           # ... (other arguments)
       ) -> Optional[Union[str, list, dict, WebElement, bool]]: # Important change
           # ... (rest of the function)
   ```
   This way, the function's return type is more explicit.

3. **Inconsistency in `get_attribute_by_locator`:**  The function returns `None` if the element isn't found, but also returns a potentially empty list (`list[WebElement]`).   Be consistent and return `Optional` types:

   ```python
   async def get_attribute_by_locator(
       # ... (other parameters)
   ) -> Optional[Union[str, list, dict, WebElement, list[WebElement]]]:
       # ... (function body)
   ```

4. **`get_webelement_by_locator` return type should be `Optional`:**

   ```python
   async def get_webelement_by_locator(
       # ... (other parameters)
   ) -> Optional[Union[WebElement, List[WebElement]]]:
       # ... (function body)
   ```

5. **Error Handling (general):**  The error handling is somewhat inconsistent.  Consider using `try...except` blocks to catch specific exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`, `TimeoutException`, `StaleElementReferenceException`) and log them with more context.  Avoid `...` as a placeholder for error handling.


6. **`execute_event` improvement:** The function is too complex, especially with the multiple `if` conditions for different events. Consider using a dictionary to map events to functions, for better maintainability:

   ```python
    async def execute_event(
        self,
        locator: Union[dict, SimpleNamespace, Locator],
        # ... other arguments
    ) -> bool:
        locator = ...
        element = await self.get_webelement_by_locator(locator, ...)

        event_handlers = {
            "click": self._click,
            "pause": self._pause,
            # ... other events
        }

        try:
            for event in locator.event.split(";"):
                event_parts = event.split("(")
                event_name = event_parts[0].strip()
                handler = event_handlers.get(event_name)
                if handler:
                    # Call the handler with the rest of the arguments, properly checked for validity
                    if await handler(element, event):
                        continue
                    else:
                        return False
                else:
                    print(f"Unknown event: {event_name}")
                    return False # Indicate failure

            return True
        except Exception as ex:
            # Proper logging here
            logger.exception(f"Error during event execution: {locator}", ex)
            return False
   ```

7. **Asyncio usage:** Ensure `asyncio.to_thread` is used correctly. Be careful with thread safety and potential deadlocks. Consider using a proper queuing mechanism for passing data between threads and the event loop if needed.

8. **`send_message` function refactoring:**  This method is too complicated. Use dedicated functions for each action (typing, replacing characters, etc.).


These improvements address the identified issues, enhance the code's robustness, and maintainability.  Applying these suggestions will lead to a more structured, efficient, and error-tolerant `executor` module. Remember to adjust imports and add the `Locator` class definition as shown. Remember to include appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms.  Using a `Locator` class and functions to handle different events and actions will be crucial to improving this code significantly.
