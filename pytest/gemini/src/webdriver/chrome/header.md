**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Mocks:**  Crucially, I've introduced fixtures (`mock_settings_json`, `mock_settings_file`, `mock_readme_file`) to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests from the actual filesystem, preventing unwanted interactions and making tests more reliable. `tmp_path` from `pytest` is used for creating the temporary directories.

2. **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:**  The tests now cover various cases:
   - Valid path with marker files in the same directory and subdirectory.
   - Case where no marker files are found.
   - Case where the marker file is in the parent directory.
   - Case where the marker files are not found.
   - Ensures the project root is correctly added to `sys.path`.

3. **Error Handling Tests:**  Tests are added to verify proper handling of `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading `settings.json` and reading `README.MD`.


4. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.

5. **pytest.raises:** Used for checking exception handling, ensuring robustness.

6. **Example Usage (incorporated into the test):** I've included an example of how to use `mock_settings_file` to create a temporary file for testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` in your terminal.  This will execute all the tests.


This revised solution addresses the critical aspects of test-driven development, including mocking, error handling, and comprehensive coverage. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/` with the actual path if your project structure is different. Remember to install necessary packages if needed:

```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
