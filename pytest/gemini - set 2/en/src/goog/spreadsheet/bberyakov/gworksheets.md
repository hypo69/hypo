```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Critically, the code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Spreadsheet` and `Worksheet` objects. This isolates the `GWorksheet` class from external dependencies, making the tests more reliable and avoiding real interactions with Google Sheets.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific about expected values (e.g., `ws.ws.title == 'new'`).
* **Exception Handling:**  The `test_gworksheet_get_exception` function demonstrates how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
* **Edge Case:** The `test_gworksheet_get_nonexistent_worksheet` now handles the case where the worksheet does not exist.
* **`mock_spreadsheet` Fixture:** The fixture now provides a more comprehensive mock `Spreadsheet` object that mimics expected behavior.
* **Method Testing (header, category):**  Added test cases for `header` and `category` methods, demonstrating how to verify interactions with the mocked `GSRender`. This is crucial since you are calling methods that are not directly accessing the Spreadsheet object
* **Missing Imports:** Added `from unittest.mock import patch, Mock` for the `mock` library.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_gworksheets.py`) in the same directory as your `gworksheets.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_gworksheets.py
    ```

This improved test suite provides a more robust and accurate way to validate the `GWorksheet` class.  Remember to adapt these tests as you add more functionality to your classes.  Always use assertions specific to the expected outcome. For example, instead of just `assert ws.ws`, assert something about the attributes, like `assert ws.ws.title == 'new'`.
