## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/goog/drive/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/goog/drive/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization module for a Google Drive related functionality within the `hypotez` project.  It likely sets up the environment and imports necessary components from other modules within the `goog/drive` package.

**Key aspects:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`**: This line defines a global variable `MODE` with a value of 'dev'.  This likely controls different operation modes (e.g., development, production).  Modify this value to change the runtime behavior.

* **Import Statement:** `from .drive import GoogleDrive`. This imports the `GoogleDrive` class (or other object) from the `drive.py` module within the same `goog/drive` folder.  This is a common Python pattern for organizing related code into sub-modules.


**How to use:**

1. **Import the necessary component:**

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.goog.drive import GoogleDrive
   ```

2. **Instantiate the GoogleDrive object:**

   ```python
   drive_instance = GoogleDrive()
   ```

3. **Use the methods of the `GoogleDrive` class:**

   The `GoogleDrive` class, defined in the `drive.py` module, will contain methods for interacting with the Google Drive API.   These methods could be for tasks like:

    * Uploading files to Google Drive
    * Downloading files from Google Drive
    * Managing folders in Google Drive
    * Authenticating against Google Drive

   The precise methods available depend on the implementation within `drive.py`.  Look for a docstring or other documentation within that module for detailed information on available methods and their parameters.


**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.goog.drive import GoogleDrive

def upload_file_to_drive(file_path, folder_id):
    drive = GoogleDrive()
    drive.authenticate()  # If authentication is needed
    drive.upload_file(file_path, folder_id)

# Example Usage
upload_file_to_drive("my_document.txt", "0B...")  # Replace "0B..." with an actual folder ID
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Authentication:** The `drive.py` module likely contains functions for authenticating with the Google Drive API.  You need to correctly configure and use authentication to access Google Drive resources.

* **Error Handling:** Add error handling to your code.  Any API calls might fail.  Implement `try...except` blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions.

* **File Paths:** Ensure that `file_path` variables in your code refer to valid file paths.

* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the necessary libraries for interacting with Google Drive (e.g., the Google Drive API client library) are installed.


**Further steps to support this usage guide:**

1. Provide the content of `hypotez/src/goog/drive/drive.py`.  This will give us a clear picture of the methods available for interacting with Google Drive.

2. Include any necessary configuration details or instructions for setting up the environment. This is especially important if authentication or specific environment variables are involved.
