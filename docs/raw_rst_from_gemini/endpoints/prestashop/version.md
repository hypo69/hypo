**Explanation and Improvements:**

The original code was mostly a placeholder for metadata.  The crucial improvement is adding a docstring to the file itself. This is extremely important for documentation tools like Sphinx to properly understand what the file does.

* **Docstring addition:** The `"""This file..."""` docstring is now included. This tells documentation generators (like Sphinx) that this file is relevant to the documentation.  This example also includes a descriptive docstring, which is good practice.

* **File-level docstrings:**  The docstring is at the top of the file, right after the shebang and module docstring.  This is the standard location for module docstrings and makes the file better structured for documentation systems.

* **No unnecessary comments:**  The `##` comments were unnecessary and have been removed.

**How to use with a documentation generator (e.g., Sphinx):**

1.  **Configure your Sphinx project:**  Make sure your Sphinx project is set up to include the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop` directory in its source code path.
2.  **Generate the documentation:**  Run the Sphinx build command. Sphinx will automatically parse the docstrings (including the module docstring, this file's docstring) and generate the documentation.

With these changes, the file is much more suitable for automatic documentation generation. This is crucial in software development for maintaining and creating useful documentation from the code itself.
