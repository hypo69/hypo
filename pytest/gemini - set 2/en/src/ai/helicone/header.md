**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses mocking to isolate tests. This is critical for preventing dependencies between tests and ensuring they run quickly and predictably.  It mocks `pathlib.Path`, `open`, and `sys.path.insert` so the tests don't depend on the actual file system.  This is crucial for pytest testing.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, highlighting the scenario being tested.

* **Edge Cases:** The `test_set_project_root_marker_not_found` test now covers the scenario where the marker files are not found, a crucial edge case.


* **Error Handling:** The tests now handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` for robustness, ensuring that the code does not crash on unexpected file conditions.

* **Mock Functions:** Separate `mock_path_exists` and `mock_open` functions provide better control and maintainability for mocking file system interactions.

* **MockPath Class:** A custom `MockPath` class is created to mock the behavior of `pathlib.Path`, enabling more detailed control over test interactions.

* **MockOpen Class:** A mock `MockOpen` class is used to control how the open function behaves.  This is crucial for correctly handling file operations without the real file system.

* **Fixture cleanup:** The added `Path.__new__ = ...` line is crucial to reset the mock behavior for subsequent tests. Without this, the tests would continue to run with the mock `Path` object.

* **sys.path removal:** Added `mock_sys_path_insert` to mock the insertion in sys.path, keeping the code independent from the file system.

This revised solution provides a much stronger, more reliable, and maintainable test suite.  Remember to replace `"some/path"` with your actual paths in the `mock_path_exists` and `mock_open` functions for more precise testing.  Adding further edge case and invalid input tests would improve coverage even more.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


Remember to adapt the mock values (`"some/path/pyproject.toml"` etc.) within `mock_path_exists` and `mock_open` to accurately reflect the files and paths your code is interacting with in your `set_project_root` function, thus making the tests reflect the real conditions in your code.
