```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** Uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` and `unittest.mock.patch` to effectively mock file existence and exceptions, creating more robust test scenarios. This is critical for isolating the `set_project_root` function from external file system interactions.  The added `mock_file_exists` fixture now correctly handles file creation and mocking `Path.exists` to allow us to control whether files exist.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during file handling, verifying exception handling in the `header.py` code.
* **Parametrized Tests:** The `test_file_not_found_or_invalid_json` test uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the same test with different file names and expected exceptions, making the tests more concise.
* **Fixture for Data:** The `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md` fixtures handle creating the necessary files and returning the `tmp_path` for cleaner test setup.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, explicitly stating the test conditions.
* **Edge Case Coverage:** Includes tests for cases where the marker files are not found, which is a crucial edge case.
* **Valid Input Test:**  A test `test_set_project_root_valid_input` is included to verify the function works as expected with a valid input.
* **Robust Exception Handling:** Includes tests for both `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in a more unified way.
* **System Path Restoration:** The `test_set_project_root_root_already_in_path` test restores the original sys.path, fixing a potential issue with modifying the test environment permanently.

This revised solution covers a wider range of scenarios, ensuring more comprehensive testing of the `header.py` code.  Remember to replace placeholders like `"TestProject"` with actual values from your `settings.json` for more accurate testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved test suite is more robust, comprehensive, and follows best practices for writing `pytest` tests. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific structure of your `settings.json` data.
