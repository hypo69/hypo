```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.fast_api.gemini.backend.main as main

# No functions or classes are defined in the provided code.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  
# Please provide the actual code to be tested.

# Example of how to write tests if functions were provided:
# def test_mode_is_dev():
#     assert main.MODE == 'dev'


# Example test for a function that might return something:
# def test_some_function_with_return_value(some_function_fixture):
#     # Assuming 'some_function_fixture' is a fixture providing the needed data
#     result = some_function(data_from_fixture)
#     assert result == expected_result, f"Function did not return expected value"


# Example of exception handling:
# def test_function_raises_exception_on_invalid_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         main.some_function("invalid_input")
#     assert "Invalid input" in str(excinfo.value)

# Example fixture (replace with appropriate fixture for your code):
# @pytest.fixture
# def some_function_fixture():
#     # Define your fixture data here, could be some data from a database, external source, etc.
#     data = {"key1": "value1", "key2": 123}
#     return data
