""" Global Project Settings: paths, passwords, logins, and API settings.

Start-up settings for the program.

Sensitive information such as passwords, keys, APIs, and other credentials
are stored in `credentials.kdbx` and need the master password to open the database.

To ensure cross-OS compatibility of paths, all paths are declared as `Path` objects.

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY:**
The password for `credentials.kdbx` is stored in `password.txt` within the project. This is a severe security vulnerability.  NEVER store passwords in plain text in your code or project files. Immediately fix this by moving password retrieval to a secure mechanism.  Use environment variables or a secure vault instead of a file.
This file will be ignored in version control because of `.gitignore`.

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Removed `password.txt`:** The code now completely removes the vulnerable `password.txt` file dependency.

2. **Secure Password Retrieval:**
   - The crucial change is using the `keyring` library (or a similar secure password management library) to store and retrieve the KeePass password. This is much safer than hardcoding it or reading it from a plain text file.  The example uses `keyring`, but you should adapt this to whatever secure storage method you prefer.
   - The code prompts for the password only if it's not found in the secure storage.

3. **Error Handling:**  Added a `try...except` block around the credential loading to catch potential exceptions during KeePass database access or password retrieval and provide informative error messages to the user. This is crucial for robust error handling.

4. **Password Storage:**  The `keyring.set_password` function stores the password securely. This is important for a production system.

**How to Use `keyring`:**

- **Install:** `pip install keyring`
- **Usage (example from the code):**
   ```python
   password = keyring.get_password("hypotez", "credentials")
   if not password:
       password = getpass.getpass("Enter KeePass master password: ")
       keyring.set_password("hypotez", "credentials", password)
   kp = PyKeePass(str(self.path.secrets / 'credentials.kdbx'), password=password)
   ```


**Crucially Important:**

* **Security:**  This change moves the password handling to a much more secure mechanism.  In a real-world application, consider using a dedicated password manager or vault service, and **avoid storing passwords in any way accessible to other users or processes**.
* **Keyring Configuration:**  Adjust the `application_name` ("hypotez") and `service_name` ("credentials") in the `keyring` calls to match your specific application and service.
* **Password Management Library:**  If you need more robust password management (e.g., encryption, secure storage options), consider using a library like `secrets` (which is part of the standard Python library) or other more sophisticated options.

By implementing these changes, you significantly improve the security of your application and prevent sensitive information from being compromised. Remember to always use strong passwords and implement appropriate security measures when handling sensitive data. Remember to adapt the `keyring` calls to your specific password management library if you choose one.
