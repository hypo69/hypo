**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Fixtures are now used for `chrome_driver`, `firefox_driver`, and `edge_driver` to avoid creating new driver instances in each test. This improves efficiency.  Crucially, a `valid_url` fixture is added for reuse.

2. **Error Handling:**  The tests now check for both successful and failed scenarios (e.g., `test_chrome_driver_invalid_url`).  More robust error handling could be added if specific exceptions are expected.

3. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, indicating the driver, action, and expected outcome.

4. **Assertions:** The tests use `assert` statements to verify expected results.

5. **Edge Cases:** Tests for invalid URL and checking domain are included.

6. **Cleanup:**  Critically, the code now includes cleanup using `finally` blocks to delete the temporary cookie files created during the tests. This prevents file accumulation and maintains a clean test environment.  This is **essential** for real-world testing.  Without this, your tests may fail later or cause unexpected issues.

7. **Comprehensive Tests:** Added tests for navigation, domain extraction, scrolling in all directions, and cookie saving for all three browsers.

8. **Import Statements:** Made sure the necessary imports are at the top.


**How to Run:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_example_driver.py`).
3. Run `pytest test_example_driver.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution addresses the requirements, providing more comprehensive and reliable tests for the `_example_driver` code. Remember to adapt the fixtures (`chrome_driver`, etc.) to your actual `Driver` class if it has different initialization requirements. Remember to replace placeholders in the `Driver` class with actual implementations for the `get_url`, `extract_domain`, `scroll`, and `_save_cookies_locally` methods if needed.
