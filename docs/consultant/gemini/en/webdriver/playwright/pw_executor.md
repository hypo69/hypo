**Received Code**

```python
## \file hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
""" module: src.webdriver.playwright """
MODE = 'development'
```

**Improved Code**

```python
## \file hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
"""
Module for interacting with Playwright web driver.
"""
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns
from src.logger import logger  # Import logger for error handling

MODE = 'development'


```

**Changes Made**

- Added an import statement for `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added an import statement for `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Added a module-level docstring in reStructuredText format to describe the module's purpose.  It was missing previously.
