**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **`TestEmilDesign` Class:**  Crucially, this example now uses a `TestEmilDesign` class to organize tests for the `EmilDesign` class. This is standard pytest practice and improves test organization.

2. **Placeholder Tests:** The example tests are now placeholders.  **You MUST replace the comments (`# ...`) with the actual methods from your `EmilDesign` class.**  This includes the input, expected output, and expected exceptions.

3. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  The `test_emil_design_invalid_input` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions.  **Adapt this to test exceptions raised by your `EmilDesign` methods.**

4. **Edge Case and Boundary Tests:** The example includes placeholders for edge-case and boundary tests.  Again, you need to fill these with specific edge cases relevant to your `EmilDesign` methods.

5. **Clear Test Names:** The test names (`test_mode_value`, `test_emil_design_creation`) are clear and descriptive.

6. **Fixtures (If Needed):** If your `EmilDesign` methods require data, add fixtures to provide it.  The example shows how to define them.

7. **Docstrings:** The tests include docstrings explaining the purpose of each test, which is best practice.

8. **Missing `input_code`:** The original prompt is incomplete as it doesn't include any code for the `EmilDesign` class. **Add the code for `EmilDesign` to the `input_code` portion of the prompt** in order for me to write comprehensive tests for it.

**How to Run the Tests:**

Save the test code (as `test_emil.py` in the same directory as your `__init__.py`) and run it from your terminal using pytest:

```bash
pytest -v test_emil.py
```

This will run the tests with verbose output, showing you the results for each test. Remember to adapt the tests to match the actual functionality of your `EmilDesign` class. Remember to place the test file (`test_emil.py`) in the same directory as the `__init__.py` file.
