**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Removed `password.txt`:**  The most critical change is the removal of the insecure `password.txt` file.  Storing passwords in plain text is a major security vulnerability.

2. **Keyring Library:**  The code now uses the `keyring` library.  This is a more secure way to store passwords on the user's system. It is recommended on Windows and Linux.


3. **Password Retrieval:**
   - The `_load_credentials` method now tries to retrieve the password from the keyring using `keyring.get_password`.
   - If the password is not found in the keyring (first time running, or keyring not set up), the user is prompted to enter it.
   - The entered password is then stored securely in the keyring using `keyring.set_password`. This ensures that the password isn't stored in plain text within your Python code.


4. **Error Handling:**  Improved error handling for password retrieval.


**How to use Keyring:**

1. **Install:**
   ```bash
   pip install keyring
   ```

2. **(Important):** Ensure `keyring` is configured for your operating system.  This will vary. For example, on Windows, you might need to use the `pywin32` package.  You may need to look at documentation specific to your system for the correct approach or configuration.


**Crucial Security Considerations:**

* **Password Manager (Alternative):**  If you don't want to use `keyring` for any reason, consider a password manager (like KeePassXC or 1Password) to store and retrieve the master password securely. You would access the credentials from the password manager programmatically.  This approach is preferable to storing anything directly in the code itself.
* **Environment Variables:** If using an environment variable to store the password, ensure it is not stored in plaintext within the code.
* **Keep Credentials Secure:** Always protect the KeePass database file.  Do not store passwords in plain text in any form (e.g., `.gitignore` or other configuration files tracked in version control).

Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ... your password loading mechanism ...`) with the appropriate code to access the password safely.  This example focuses on using `keyring`.

By implementing these changes, you significantly enhance the security of your application and comply with best practices for handling sensitive information. Remember that a password manager approach offers an even higher level of security.
