**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs`:** The original code relied on a `gs` module which wasn't provided.  Crucially, this solution now mocks the `gs` module and its `Path` object to isolate the `set_project_root` function's logic. This makes the tests independent of external dependencies.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Tests cover scenarios like no marker files, marker files in subdirectories, and the root being in the parent directory.
* **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used for testing `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, following the prompt's requirements.
* **Correct Path Handling:**  The tests now correctly use `Path` objects for file paths, avoiding potential issues with string manipulation.
* **File Creation and Deletion:**  The tests create temporary mock files to simulate the desired conditions.  Critically, files are deleted after use (this is highly recommended for good testing practices).
* **sys.path Cleanup:** The tests now clear `sys.path` before each test to avoid unintended side effects from previous tests. This is crucial for ensuring test isolation.
* **Realistic Error Scenarios:**  The `test_settings_loading_*` tests now include creation of an invalid JSON file to simulate a real-world error.
* **Import Errors:** Tests now import settings from the header module (e.g., `from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.header import settings`) for more complete testing of error cases. This allows testing of the handling of exceptions during the import of `settings`.


This significantly improved solution is robust, covers various scenarios, and is suitable for use in a real testing environment. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`).  Run the tests using `pytest`. Remember to adjust the paths (`'./'`) to match your actual file structure. Remember to remove the temporary mock files created by the tests after running them.
