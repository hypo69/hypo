**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific aspect being tested (e.g., `test_version_is_version_object`).

2. **Specific Assertions:**  Tests now check for the expected types (`Version`, `str`, `dict`) and not just for non-null values.  Crucially, it checks for the presence of `'name'`, `'description'`, and `'author'`  keys within the `__details__` dictionary.

3. **Edge Case Testing (Missing Key):** Includes a test (`test_details_missing_key_raises_exception`) to demonstrate handling of a missing key, which is a common edge case.

4. **Handling Potential `KeyError`:** Using `pytest.raises` is correct for testing exceptions.

5. **Meaningful Assertions for `__details__`:** This example assumes `__details__` is a dictionary containing 'name', 'description', and 'author' keys.  The tests verify the expected types and values (non-emptiness) of these key-value pairs. **Adapt these tests based on the actual structure of `__details__`**.  

6. **Missing Code Handling:** The previous tests now specifically test expected attributes of the return values.


**Before Running:**

- **Install pytest:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **Ensure the `hypotez/src/webdriver/chrome/extentions/__init__.py` file** is in the same directory as your test file. Or, adjust the import paths in the tests if necessary.



This revised solution addresses the comments and provides more comprehensive and robust test coverage. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual structure and content of the `__details__` dictionary. Add more specific checks on the content of strings if needed based on the specifics of your program's behavior.
