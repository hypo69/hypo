**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest` Structure:** The code now follows the `pytest` structure, with test functions named clearly and using `pytest.raises` for potential exceptions (though the original JavaScript code didn't have any Python exceptions).


2. **`@pytest.fixture`:** A `driver_instance` fixture is added to create and manage the WebDriver.  Crucially, this fixture **quits the driver** after the test, preventing resource leaks.  This is **absolutely essential** for any tests that involve a browser.


3. **WebDriver Integration:**  The tests now use `driver.execute_script` to execute the JavaScript code within the context of the browser.


4. **Handling Alerts (Crucial):** The `test_borderify_alerts` and `test_borderify_with_driver` functions now include a crucial step: handling the alert box.  The `WebDriverWait` and `EC.alert_is_present()` ensure the test doesn't proceed until the alert is actually present.  The `alert.accept()` method dismisses the alert, allowing the test to continue. This is vital because the `alert()` function in JavaScript will block the execution of the following line of code in your browser without handling it.



5. **`@pytest.mark.usefixtures("driver_instance")`:**  This decorator ensures that the `driver_instance` fixture is used for every test case. Without it, you'd need to manually pass the driver to each test function, which isn't ideal.


6. **Error Handling:** The test now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential `TimeoutException`. This makes the test more robust by preventing crashes if the alert doesn't appear within a reasonable time. The `finally` block is now used to handle potential stale element exceptions and prevents errors from occurring when accepting the alert.


7. **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more explicit and descriptive, making it easier to understand what the test is verifying.


8. **Edge/Chrome:** The code uses `webdriver.Edge` in the fixture (you'll need to install the appropriate webdriver). You can easily modify this to use `webdriver.Chrome` if needed.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest`, `selenium`, and the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., `MicrosoftWebDriver.exe` for Edge, `chromedriver.exe` for Chrome) installed.
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_borderify.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_borderify.py`.

This revised solution is much more complete and addresses the potential issues with alerts, proper resource management, and robust error handling. Remember to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest selenium msedge-selenium-tools
```
Replace `msedge-selenium-tools` with the appropriate library for your browser if it's not Edge. Remember to include the proper path to the webdriver executable in the `test_borderify_with_driver` function when using `webdriver.Edge()`.
