```
## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Wrapped the core operations of `base64_to_tmpfile` in a `try...except` block to catch and log potential errors (decoding issues, file handling errors).  This is crucial for robust error handling.
- Added type hints (`-> str`) to specify return types.
- Added comprehensive docstrings in reStructuredText (RST) format for both functions.  These now include detailed explanations, parameters, return values, and even exception handling, following Python docstring standards.
- Added `TypeError` and `ValueError` checks, and `logger.error` calls for more specific error handling within `base64_to_tmpfile`
- Improved the error handling to re-raise exceptions, allowing calling functions to handle them appropriately.
- Updated `base64encode` function with RST-style documentation and robust error handling, especially for file not found.
