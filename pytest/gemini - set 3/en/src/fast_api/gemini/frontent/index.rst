```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.  Therefore,
# no tests can be written.  This file likely serves as a template
# for an HTML front-end, and tests should be written for the
# corresponding JavaScript (app.js) or Python backend code.

# Example of how to test a JavaScript file (if applicable):
#
# (Assumed app.js content for example):
#
# ```javascript
# function greet(name) {
#   if (typeof name === 'string' && name.length > 0) {
#     return `Hello, ${name}!`;
#   } else {
#     throw new Error("Invalid name");
#   }
# }
#
# document.getElementById('chat-app').textContent = greet('User');
# ```
#
# Example pytest tests for app.js (hypothetical):
#
# ```python
# import pytest
#
# # (If necessary, import any necessary modules to interact with
# # the Javascript code, e.g., browser automation tools)
#
# # (Example using a hypothetical test runner that can run Javascript)
# def test_greet_valid_name():
#   # Assuming your javascript runner allows passing parameters
#   # like input to a function. If you have integration with a
#   # specific javascript runner (e.g., Playwright),
#   # you would use that runner to call the greet function.
#   result = greet('Alice')
#   assert result == 'Hello, Alice!'
#
# def test_greet_invalid_name():
#   with pytest.raises(Error) as excinfo:
#     greet(123) # Invalid input
#   assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid name"
#
# def test_greet_empty_name():
#   with pytest.raises(Error) as excinfo:
#     greet('') # Empty string
#   assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid name"
#
# ```
#
# Please provide the actual JavaScript (app.js) code to write
# more accurate and meaningful tests.
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`index.html`) is a static template.  There's no Python code present to test.  To write meaningful tests, you need the corresponding JavaScript code (likely `app.js`) and possibly the associated Python backend (if it handles data submission or logic for the front-end).  The provided example tests demonStarte a hypothetical situation where you have javascript functionality.  You would need a way to run and interact with the javascript code from your Python tests, typically using browser automation tools like Playwright or Selenium.

**How to proceed:**

1. **Identify the JavaScript Code (`app.js`):**  Obtain the source code for `app.js` which is referenced in your HTML.

2. **Choose a Javascript Testing Framework (if applicable):**  Consider using Jest, Mocha, or similar for testing the JavaScript code directly if there's a front-end JavaScript application.

3. **Adapt the Example Tests:** Modify the example pytest structure to match your actual javascript functions and their expected behavior.  Your test setup should include:
   * **Import necessary modules:** if needed for running the Javascript from your Python environment.
   * **Define Test Functions:** covering different scenarios (valid input, invalid input, boundary cases, error handling).
   * **Use `pytest.raises`:**  to test for exceptions as appropriate.
   * **Assertions:** Use `assert` statements to verify the expected outputs and conditions.

4. **Run Javascript Tests:** If using browser automation tools, ensure that the JavaScript code and browser are properly set up in your development environment.  Then, run your pytest tests to execute your javascript code and verify your assertions.


Without the actual JavaScript code, I can only provide an example framework.  Provide the JavaScript file and any relevant backend Python code and I can generate specific test cases. Remember to adapt the examples to the specific structures and requirements of your application.
