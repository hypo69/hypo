```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling and Clarity:** The `try...except` block now correctly catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, providing more specific error messages.  Crucially, it now prints a message if `settings.json` is missing instead of silently failing. This makes debugging much easier.  The error message is significantly improved.
* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function.  This is important; if your `settings.json` file contains non-ASCII characters, this prevents common encoding errors.
* **Correct Key Name:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"` in the code.  Typos are a frequent source of errors.
* **Readability:** Improved variable names (e.g., `__cofee__` to `__coffee__`).  More descriptive variable names and comments make the code much more readable and maintainable.
* **Conciseness:**  Simplified the `if settings` checks slightly in several places.

**How to Use and Important Considerations:**

1.  **`settings.json`:** Ensure you have a `settings.json` file in the `src` directory of your project, formatted correctly as a JSON object.  This is necessary for the script to work.

2.  **`pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`):**  The `get_project_root` function is critical for locating your project's root directory. This script now uses more robust marker files. The `pyproject.toml` file or `setup.py` (a common Python setup file) or `requirements.txt` files are all commonly used to indicate the project root in Python projects.


This revised version is much more robust and easier to understand and use.  Proper error handling and informative messages are key for reliable Python scripts. Remember to adapt `marker_files` if your project uses a different way of marking the project root.
