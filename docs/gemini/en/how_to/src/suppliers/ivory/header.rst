How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It searches upward from the current file's directory until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, it adds the root directory to the Python path.  The code also loads project settings (e.g., name, version, author) from a `settings.json` file and optionally a description string from a `README.MD` file. Finally, it defines several variables that hold project information.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging`, and `Path` from `pathlib`.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of file/directory names as input. It initializes `current_path` to the directory containing the current file.

3. **Iterate upwards:** The code iterates through the parent directories of `current_path` to locate the project root.

4. **Check for marker files:** Inside the loop, it checks if any of the marker files (`marker_files`) exists within the current parent directory using `any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files)`.

5. **Set root and update path:** If a marker file is found, it sets the `__root__` variable to the parent directory and exits the loop. It also inserts the path to the root directory into the `sys.path` list. This ensures that the project's modules are importable from within the project.

6. **Return the project root:** The function returns the `__root__` path.

7. **Call `set_project_root`:**  The code calls the function to get the project's root directory. This result is assigned to the variable `__root__`.

8. **Load project settings:** The code attempts to open and load the `settings.json` file located in the project root. If the file exists and can be parsed as JSON, its contents are loaded into the `settings` variable.  If not found or not valid JSON, the `settings` variable remains `None`.

9. **Load documentation (optional):**  Similarly, attempts to load the `README.MD` file and stores the content in the `doc_str` variable.

10. **Define project variables:** The code creates several variables (__project_name__, __version__, __doc__, __details__, __author__, __copyright__, __cofee__) that store project information.  They are populated from the `settings` dictionary if available, otherwise with default values (e.g., 'hypotez' for project name).

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    # Create dummy files for testing
    (Path(__file__).parent / "pyproject.toml").touch()
    (Path(__file__).parent.parent / "settings.json").write_text('{"project_name": "MyProject", "version": "1.0.0"}')
    # (Path(__file__).parent.parent / "README.MD").write_text("My Documentation")
    
    # Call the function in the example environment
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.header import set_project_root
    root_directory = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {root_directory}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")  # Accessing the variable from the example
