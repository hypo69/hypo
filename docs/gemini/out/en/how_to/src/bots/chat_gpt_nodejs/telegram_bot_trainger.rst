How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a Telegram bot that interacts with a language model (likely OpenAI). The bot handles various types of user input, including text messages, documents, and voice messages.  It processes these inputs, sends them to the language model for processing, receives a response, and then replies to the user with the model's output.  The bot also includes command handlers for common commands like `/start` and `/help`.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports libraries for Telegram bot interaction, file handling, speech recognition, audio manipulation, and text-to-speech conversion.

2. **Define bot configuration:**  It sets a `MODE` variable (likely for development/production mode) and retrieves the Telegram bot token from a configuration file (`gs.credentials.telegram.bot_token`).

3. **Define handler functions:**
    - `start()`: Handles the `/start` command, providing a greeting message.
    - `help_command()`: Handles the `/help` command, displaying available commands.
    - `handle_message()`: Handles incoming text messages, sends them to the model, and replies with the result.
    - `handle_document()`: Handles incoming documents, downloads them, extracts the content, sends the content to the model, and replies with the result.
    - `handle_voice()`: Handles incoming voice messages, transcribes them using a speech recognition library, sends the transcript to the model, and replies with the result.   Note this utilizes `recognizer` and `text_to_speech` functions for conversion to text and back.

4. **Create a Telegram Application:** An `Application` is built using the Telegram bot token.

5. **Register handlers:** The application registers the defined command handlers and message handlers.

6. **Run the bot:** The `run_polling()` method starts the bot and listens for incoming messages and commands.

7. **Model Interaction:** The core logic revolves around the `model` object (likely an OpenAI API client) which is used to send messages to the language model and get a response. The responses are then sent back to the user.

8. **File Handling:** The code handles downloading and reading document files.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example of sending a text message to the bot (replace with your Telegram bot's username/handle):
    # ... your Telegram bot interaction code or method ... 
    # Example showing how to send the message.
    await update.message.reply_text("Hello! Can you help with this document?")
    
    # Example of sending a document using your Telegram bot interaction method to send a file

    # ... your Telegram bot interaction code or method ... 
    # Example showing how to send the file.  
    
    # You'll need to have the necessary setup (e.g., access to your documents and credentials).
