# <algorithm>

1. **`set_project_root` function:**
   - Takes a tuple of `marker_files` as input.
   - Starts at the directory of the current file (`__file__`).
   - Iterates through parent directories.
   - Checks if any of the marker files exist in the current parent directory using `any()`.
   - If a marker file is found, it sets `__root__` to the parent directory and breaks the loop.
   - Adds the root directory to `sys.path` if it's not already there.
   - Returns the `__root__` Path object.


2. **Getting Project Root:**
   - Calls `set_project_root()` to get the project root.
   - Stores the result in `__root__`

3. **Loading Settings:**
   - Tries to open `src/settings.json` file in read mode (`'r'`).
   - Parses the JSON data from the file using `json.load()` and assigns it to the `settings` variable.
   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` if the file is not found or has invalid JSON format.
   - Uses a default value `'hypotez'` if settings are not available.

4. **Loading Documentation:**
   - Tries to open `src/README.MD` file in read mode (`'r'`).
   - Reads the entire file content and assigns it to `doc_str`.
   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
   - Uses an empty string as a default if documentation isn't available.


5. **Setting Project Metadata:**
   - Extracts project name, version, author, copyright, and a coffee link from the `settings` dictionary.
   - Uses default values if corresponding keys are missing from the settings.
   - Assigns the values to `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.

```
**Dependencies:**

- `sys`:  For interacting with the Python runtime environment, particularly for manipulating the `sys.path` list.
- `json`: For parsing and serializing JSON data.
- `pathlib`: For working with file paths in a more object-oriented way.
- `packaging.version`: For working with software versions (likely for checking or parsing version strings).
- `gs`: A custom module within the `src` package (likely responsible for handling file system paths).


# <explanation>

- **Imports:**
    - `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
    - `json`: For encoding and decoding JSON data.
    - `packaging.version`: Used for handling version numbers reliably.
    - `pathlib`: For representing file paths in a more object-oriented way.
    - `gs`: A custom module likely part of the project's internal structure; it probably handles file system paths.

- **`set_project_root` function:** This function is crucial for locating the project's root directory. It's generally a good practice to ensure that Python can find project files, especially those that support absolute paths.


- **Classes (none explicitly defined):** The code doesn't define any classes.

- **Functions:**
    - `set_project_root()`: Takes a tuple of `marker_files` and returns the path to the project's root directory. It's well-structured with clear purpose.


- **Variables:**
    - `__root__`: Holds the path to the project root directory, a crucial variable for the rest of the code.
    - `settings`: Stores parsed JSON data from `settings.json`, enabling the code to retrieve values from the configuration file.
    - `doc_str`: Holds the content of the `README.MD` file, allowing the code to access documentation text.
    - Other variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc.) store extracted metadata for the project.


- **Errors and Improvements:**
    - The `try...except` blocks are good for handling potential errors like file not found or invalid JSON format.
    - The `gs` module is assumed to exist and contains file path objects.  Having clear documentation about the gs module is essential for maintainability and readability.
    - Using default values (e.g., 'hypotez' for the project name) handles cases where configuration files are missing or corrupted, preventing unexpected crashes.


**Relationship with Other Parts of the Project:**

The code heavily relies on `gs.path.root` which strongly suggests a package dedicated to interacting with file systems. This file is likely using relative paths, making this code modular and allowing the use of the file system within the `gs` package independently from this file. The use of relative paths (such as `'src/settings.json'`) is a good practice for maintainability and modularity. This code interacts with other modules in the project (`src`) through imports. These modules likely provide tools or services.
