**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `get_product_details`:** The most crucial change is mocking the external API call (`get_product_details`). This isolates the test from the actual API, preventing network calls and making the tests fast and reliable.  We use `monkeypatch` to replace the function with a mock.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test names now more accurately reflect the input.

3. **Comprehensive Input:** Valid and invalid URL types are tested.  We also include a test for an empty input list.

4. **Edge Case Testing:** `test_process_affiliate_products_empty_input` handles the empty input scenario, which is an important edge case.

5. **Handling Invalid Input (Example):** The commented-out `test_process_affiliate_products_invalid_input_raises_exception` illustrates how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.  This is a placeholder, as no exception-raising code exists in the provided snippet.

6. **Return Value Assertion:** Tests now assert on the actual return value of `process_affiliate_products`.  It now checks for correct length and the `product_id`.

**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_affiliated_products.py`) in the same directory as your `affiliated_products_generator.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_affiliated_products.py
    ```


**Important Consideration:**

The provided code snippet doesn't contain error handling for invalid product URLs. This is a *major omission* in the original code. You should add proper error handling (and test cases for that error handling) to your `AliAffiliatedProducts` class to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes when processing invalid product data.  My example tests demonstrate how to test for such a situation, but it's not fully applicable without the exception-raising code in the original code.
