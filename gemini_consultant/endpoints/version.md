```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches both `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Crucially, it prints an informative error message.  This is essential for debugging.  The `...` is removed as it's not a good practice.  Instead, the code now handles the exception by printing a message that helps in finding the issue with the settings.json file, and an example is given of how to set default values should the settings file not exist.  This is a crucial step for production-ready code.

* **Corrected Variable Name:**  The `copyright` variable name was corrected.


* **PEP 8 Compliance (minor):**  Added whitespace for readability around the `=` sign in variable assignments.

* **Default Values:** While the default values were set in the original code, providing a helpful error message and explicitly stating default values for the settings would improve the robustness and clarity of the code.  Setting sensible defaults in the error handling portion is recommended.  For instance if you wanted to set a fallback in case the file wasn't found you could use something like:

```python
settings = {"project_name": "hypotez", "version": "0.1.0", ... }
```

**How to use the improved code:**

1.  **Create a `settings.json` file** in the `../` directory (relative to `version.py`). The format should be valid JSON:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, My Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

2.  Run your script. If `settings.json` exists and is valid, the script will load the values. If not, an informative error message will be printed, and the default values will be used.

This improved version is more robust and provides valuable feedback to the user in case something goes wrong with the `settings.json` file, making it much more suitable for production use. Remember to adjust the default values based on your needs.
