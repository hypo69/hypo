**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, like `test_resource_list_valid_values` to improve readability and understand the purpose of each test.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Added tests to verify the length of the list, the types of elements, the presence of specific resources, and the absence of empty strings. Tests for duplicate items and type checking (for potential errors).

3. **Error Handling:** Included an example `test_resource_list_invalid_type` that demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions. This is important even if no explicit exceptions are raised in the code.  Note: since no explicit exception handling or raising exists in the provided code, this is an example and needs adaptation if actual exceptions are present in the functions.

4. **Import Statements:** Corrected import statements to `hypotez` package path.


5. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to the test functions explaining the purpose of each test.  This crucial documentation improves understanding.


**How to run the tests:**

Make sure you have pytest installed.  Then, save the test code (e.g., `test_api_resources.py`) in the same directory as `api_resourses_list.py` and run:

```bash
pytest test_api_resources.py
```

This will execute the test cases and report the results.  If you have a more complex function that takes arguments, you'll likely need to write test functions that provide those arguments.  This is a good starting point for a comprehensive test suite. Remember to adapt the test cases if the function under test is more sophisticated.
