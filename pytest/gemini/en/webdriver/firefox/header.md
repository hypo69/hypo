```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Files:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` to create dummy `settings.json` and `README.MD` files within a temporary directory (`tmp_path`). This allows testing the file reading logic without relying on real files.
2. **`mock_sys_path` Fixture:**  A `mock_sys_path` fixture is introduced to control the `sys.path`. This is crucial for testing `sys.path.insert` without affecting the real environment.
3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios: valid file presence, absence of files, and different directory structures, ensuring robustness.
4. **Error Handling:** Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are added to validate the proper handling of file loading exceptions.
5. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately clear.
6. **`pytest.raises` (not needed in these tests):** `pytest.raises` is not strictly necessary in these cases as we are directly verifying the values or existence of files, but it's generally a good practice when dealing with exceptions.
7. **`tmp_path`:**  The use of `pytest.tmpdir` is replaced with `tmp_path`, which is more flexible and aligns with modern pytest conventions.

This revised solution provides a more complete and robust set of tests for the provided Python code. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`) if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```


To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
