""" Quick start to `hypotez`

This file provides a quick start example for using the `hypotez` library.
It demonstrates basic functionalities and shows how to integrate it into a project.

**Example Usage:**

(Insert example code demonstrating usage here)


**Explanation:**

(Insert explanation of the code examples and how they relate to `hypotez`)


**Dependencies:**

(List any required dependencies, libraries, or packages needed to run this example)


**Troubleshooting:**

(Include any potential issues or troubleshooting steps that might be encountered when using this example)
"""

# Example code goes here...
# Demonstrate usage of `hypotez` functions/classes
#  e.g.,
# from hypotez import MyModel
# model = MyModel(...)
# result = model.run(...)
# print(result)



```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring is expanded significantly to provide a more informative and helpful introduction. It now includes sections for example usage, explanation, dependencies, and troubleshooting.  Crucially, it *prompts* for the example code and explanation to be added.

2. **Placeholder for Example Code:**  The code now includes a placeholder (`# Example code goes here...`) to clearly indicate where the actual example code should be inserted.  This is vital for a complete, usable example.

3. **Placeholder for Explanation:**  The code also includes a placeholder for an explanation of the included example code.  This promotes clarity and context.

4. **Placeholder for Dependencies:** A section for listing necessary dependencies is included, an important aspect of any documented code.

5. **Placeholder for Troubleshooting:** A section to include potential issues or troubleshooting steps is added to help users.


**Next Steps:**

To complete this quick start example, you need to:

* **Insert example usage code:**  Provide the actual code that demonstrates how to use the `hypotez` library.
* **Explain the example code:**  Describe the example code, its purpose, and how it relates to `hypotez`.
* **List dependencies:** Provide a list of libraries or packages required to run the code.
* **Add troubleshooting information:** If there are any known issues or common problems, document them here.


Once these steps are completed, the `quick_start.py` file will be a valuable resource for users getting started with `hypotez`. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual code and information. This enhanced structure makes the example much more usable and helpful.
