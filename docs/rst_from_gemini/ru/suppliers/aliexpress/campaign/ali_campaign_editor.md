```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **`campaign_file` Parameter:**
    * Added a `campaign_file` parameter to the constructor.
    * Now allows loading a campaign from a JSON file (`<lang>_<currency>.json`).  This is a more robust and flexible method.
    * **Error Handling:** Includes `CriticalError` if neither `campaign_name` nor `campaign_file` is provided. Now includes a `TypeError` if `campaign_file` is not a string or Path.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior.
* **`super().__init__` Call:** The `campaign_file` argument is now correctly passed to the `AliPromoCampaign` constructor via `super().__init__`.
* **Google Sheet Initialization:** Moved the initialization of `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` *inside* the `__init__` method.  This is critical; you cannot use `self.google_sheet` before it's initialized.


**Example Usage (with file loading):**

```python
# Example loading from file
editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name="Summer Sale", campaign_file="EN_USD.json")

# Example using parameters
editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name="Winter Sale", language="FR", currency="EUR")


```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `delete_product` method now uses a more specific `FileNotFoundError` for handling cases where the product file doesn't exist, and a general `Exception` for other issues.  This is a better approach than relying solely on `except Exception`.
* **`campaign_file` Handling:** The `campaign_file` parameter now handles the situation where the file could not be loaded correctly.
* **Robustness:** The code is now more resilient to potential issues.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints (e.g., `Optional[str | dict]`).
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings for clarity and completeness.


By addressing these points, your code becomes more robust, maintainable, and easier to use. Remember to handle potential exceptions more specifically in production code.  The addition of explicit error handling with appropriate error types ensures that your code is more reliable. Always consider edge cases and potential failure points in your code.
