How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py`, provides a framework for handling data acquisition from various suppliers.  It defines a `Supplier` class as a base, and allows for extending it with supplier-specific functions.

**Core Concepts**

* **`Supplier` class:** The base class for all supplier interactions.  It likely handles common tasks like initialization and connection management.

* **`supplier.related_functions`:** An interface for adding supplier-specific functions. This is crucial for separating generic supplier logic from supplier-specific methods.

* **`supplier_prefix`:**  A string that uniquely identifies a particular supplier (e.g., `amazon`, `aliexpress`).  This prefix is used to locate the specific functions for that supplier.  These functions live in directories named after the supplier prefix (e.g., `amazon`, `aliexpress`, `morlevi`).

* **`Graber`, `Context`, `close_pop_up`:** Likely related to the process of acquiring data.  `Graber` likely handles the core data extraction, `Context` might hold relevant information for the process, and `close_pop_up` handles any popup windows that might arise during data retrieval.

**How to Use**

1. **Create a supplier-specific directory:**  For a supplier named "Amazon", create a directory named `amazon` within the `src/suppliers` directory.

2. **Implement supplier-specific functions:**  Within the `amazon` directory, place Python files containing the specific functions to extract data from Amazon.  These functions need to implement the logic defined by the `supplier.related_functions` interface.  Critical functions will use `Graber` objects.


3. **Import and Instantiate `Supplier`:**  In your application code, import the `Supplier` class.  You'll then instantiate it using the appropriate `supplier_prefix`.


```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers import Supplier

# Example instantiating a Supplier for Amazon
amazon_supplier = Supplier("amazon")

# Example: calling a method from the Amazon-specific directory to extract data
extracted_data = amazon_supplier.extract_product_data("some_id")
```


4. **Handle `supplier.related_functions`:** The specific way to use `supplier.related_functions` is crucial but not detailed.  The `supplier` might be a module object or an explicit call into the `related_functions` interface object.  This part requires examination of the actual `Supplier` and `related_functions` code.


**Important Considerations**

* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling within the supplier-specific functions to manage issues like network problems, invalid data, or supplier-specific exceptions.  `Graber` class should already handle some basic error conditions.

* **Data Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the data returned by each supplier-specific function to ensure its quality and consistency.

* **Documentation:** Each supplier-specific function should have appropriate docstrings to explain its parameters, return values, and behavior.


**Example Structure (hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/)**

```
hypotez/
└── src/
    └── suppliers/
        └── amazon/
            └── amazon_specific_functions.py
            └── __init__.py
```

```python
# hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/amazon_specific_functions.py
def get_product_price(product_id, graber):
    # ... code to extract product price from Amazon ...
    return price  # Return the extracted price
```


This detailed explanation should allow you to effectively use this code to retrieve data from various suppliers.  Remember to examine the `Supplier` and `related_functions` implementations for precise details on usage and interactions.
