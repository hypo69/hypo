```
Changes Made
```

- **Import `logger`:** Added `from src.logger import logger`.
- **Error Handling:** Replaced most `if` statements after method calls with `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors and log them using `logger.error()`. This is a more robust approach than relying on simple `if` checks.
- **`finally` block:** Added a `finally` block to ensure `chrome_driver.quit()` is called, even if exceptions occur. This is critical for closing the browser window properly.
- **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive RST docstrings to the `main` function and the whole module for better readability.
- **Improved Comments:** Rewrote comments in a more structured and concise manner.
- **Removed unnecessary `print` statements:** Removed unnecessary print statements that were not adding value to the example.
- **Added `quit` to the `if` block:** Included the `chrome_driver.quit()` call inside the `if` block to ensure proper closing of the driver.
- **Added more descriptive error messages:** Added more context to the error messages logged by the `logger`.
