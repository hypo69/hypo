**Received Code**



**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

- Added necessary imports (`from pathlib import Path`, `from packaging.version import Version`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`, `from src.logger import logger`).
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON handling.
- Added RST documentation for the `get_project_root` function, including type hints.
- Improved error handling using `logger.error` for file not found and JSON decoding errors.  Removed unnecessary `...`
- Improved file reading using `.read_text()` instead of direct `.read()`.
- Corrected variable names to match Python conventions (e.g., `__root__` to `__root__`).
- Modified variable types in the docstrings to reflect the actual types (`dict` for `settings`, `str` for `__doc__`).
- Rewrote comments for all variables and functions in RST format, and added type hints wherever possible.
- Corrected typos (`copyrihgnt` to `copyright`).
- Added comments (`#`) to clarify changes made to the original code.
