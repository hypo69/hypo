## Usage Guide for `test_affiliated_products_generator.py`

This guide explains how to use the test suite for the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class, located in `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/_pytests/test_affiliated_products_generator.py`.  The tests ensure the core functionality of the class works as expected.

**1. Project Structure:**

The code assumes a project structure like this:

```
hypotez/
└── src/
    └── suppliers/
        └── aliexpress/
            └── affiliated_products_generator.py  # Class under test
            └── _pytests/
                └── test_affiliated_products_generator.py  # Test file
```

**2. Running the Tests:**

To run the tests, navigate to the project root in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/_pytests/test_affiliated_products_generator.py
```

**3. Understanding the Code:**

* **Fixtures:**
    * `ali_affiliated_products`:  This fixture creates an instance of `AliAffiliatedProducts`. It's essential for setting up the test environment.  Crucially, it provides a consistent instance for each test, avoiding potential state issues.


* **Tests:**
    * `test_check_and_process_affiliate_products`: This test verifies that `check_and_process_affiliate_products` correctly calls `process_affiliate_products` with the provided product URLs.  It uses `unittest.mock.patch` to simulate the `process_affiliate_products` method and verify its call.  This is a crucial unit test, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

    * `test_process_affiliate_products`: This test focuses on the `process_affiliate_products` method.  It sets up a mocked `retrieve_product_details` function using `unittest.mock.patch` that returns sample product data (`mock_product_details`).  Furthermore, it mocks functions like `ensure_https`, `save_png_from_url`, `save_video_from_url`, and `j_dumps` to isolate the `process_affiliate_products` method under test. This prevents tests from depending on external interactions or the file system.  Importantly, it verifies the return value (`processed_products`), ensuring the expected number of products and their attributes are correct.

**4. Important Considerations:**

* **Mocking:** The tests heavily rely on mocking (`patch`) to isolate `AliAffiliatedProducts`.  This is vital for preventing external dependencies (like network calls, file operations) from affecting the results. This isolates and isolates the testing from external factors, ensuring that you're only testing the internal logic of the method.

* **Sample Data:** The `prod_urls`, `campaign_name`, etc., are sample data used in the tests.  Adjust them to match your actual data when running the tests on your data.

* **`SimpleNamespace`:**  The use of `types.SimpleNamespace` creates a simple object to hold the data for mocked product details. This is a common way to quickly create mock objects in Python.

* **Dependencies:** The tests include `pytest` and `unittest.mock`. Ensure these are installed in your project.


**5. How to use this test suite for your own code:**

* **Extend the Test Cases:** Add more tests to cover edge cases or specific scenarios within the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class.
* **Populate Data:**  Modify the sample data (e.g., product URLs, error scenarios) to be more meaningful to your requirements.
* **Mock Actual Functions:**  Update the mocked methods (e.g., `retrieve_product_details`) to accurately represent the expected behavior.


By following this guide, you can effectively use this test suite to validate your `AliAffiliatedProducts` class. Remember to thoroughly test different input values and edge cases to improve the robustness of your code.
