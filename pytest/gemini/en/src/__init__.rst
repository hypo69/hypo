**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_gs_exists`**:  Verifies that the `gs` variable is defined and not `None`.  Crucial for ensuring the module loads correctly.

2. **`test_credentials_module_import`**: This test now handles the case where the import might fail. This is a critical test because the rest of the tests won't run if the module itself is broken.


3. **`test_gs_attributes`**: This is an important addition. It checks if the `gs` object, if it's not None, actually has the expected attributes like a bucket name or client.  This is *highly* recommended to prevent potential runtime errors related to accessing methods/attributes of an object that doesn't exist. It also uses `pytest.fail` if the `gs` object is not in the expected format. This is essential to ensure that the `gs` object isn't just a placeholder.

4. **`test_mode_defined` and `test_mode_value`**: These tests check for the definition and value of the `MODE` variable, ensuring it's present and matches the expected value ('dev').

5. **`test_mode_non_dev`**:  A new test demonstrating how to test for the expected value of a variable using `pytest.raises`.  This example shows how to assert that the `MODE` is not another value.

6. **Clearer Error Messages**: Improved error messages to help diagnose issues if a test fails.

7. **Robustness:** The tests are now more resilient to different scenarios, including potential `ImportError` exceptions and incorrect data types.

**Important Considerations (for real-world applications):**

* **Mocking:**  In a real-world scenario where `credentials.gs` relies on external services, you'd likely mock the external interaction.  This is good practice to avoid making external calls during testing.
* **`google-cloud-storage` and Credentials:** The test `test_gs_attributes`  assumes the existence of attributes like `bucket_name` and a `client`. These attributes would likely be part of a `google-cloud-storage` client object. You might need to import and initialize a mock `google-cloud-storage` client if you're using one, or replace the example with the correct attribute test based on the library you are using.


This enhanced test suite is much more robust and reliable for verifying the core functionality of the `hypotez.src` module, particularly concerning the `gs` object and the `MODE` variable. Remember to adapt the `test_gs_attributes`  section if the structure of the credentials object varies. Always ensure that the tests are testing the actual logic of the credentials object rather than simply checking for the existence of a placeholder variable. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already:  `pip install pytest`
