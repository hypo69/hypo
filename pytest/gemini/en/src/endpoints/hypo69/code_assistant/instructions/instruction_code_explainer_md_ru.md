**Explanation of the tests:**

The provided code snippet is a placeholder.  I've created test functions for `some_function`.  Crucially, these tests cover:

* **Valid Input:** `test_some_function_valid_input` demonstrates correct behavior with a valid string.
* **Empty Input:** `test_some_function_empty_string` tests handling of an empty string.
* **Invalid Input (None):** `test_some_function_none_input` uses `pytest.raises` to check if the expected `ValueError` is raised when the input is `None`.
* **Invalid Input (Non-String):** `test_some_function_invalid_type` verifies that a `TypeError` is raised when the input is not a string.

**How to use these tests:**

1. **Replace the placeholder:**  Replace the `# The user-provided code goes here` comment with the actual Python code you want to test.
2. **Adapt the tests:** If your functions have different inputs, arguments, or error conditions, adapt these tests to correctly reflect those aspects of the code.  Add new tests for new functionality.
3. **Run the tests:** Use `pytest` to execute these tests from your terminal in the directory containing the Python file and the test file.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Edge Cases:**  The example tests include edge cases (empty string) but may need to be extended depending on the complexity of the input function's behavior.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  To create a complete test suite, you should add test functions to cover every path of execution, every possible input, and every potential exception.
* **Error Handling:**  The tests ensure that the correct exceptions are raised for incorrect input.
* **Docstrings:**  The docstrings explain the purpose of each test, making the test suite more readable and maintainable.


**To make this example more useful, please provide the actual Python code you want tested.** Then I can create more specific and accurate tests.  This example is a template and requires specific code to be effectively and completely tested.
