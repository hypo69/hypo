```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.bots import MODE, TelegramBot

def test_mode_is_string():
    """Tests that MODE is a string."""
    assert isinstance(MODE, str)

def test_mode_is_valid_string():
    """Tests that MODE is a valid string (not empty or None)."""
    assert MODE
    assert MODE is not None

def test_telegram_bot_exists():
    """Tests that the TelegramBot class exists."""
    assert TelegramBot
    
def test_telegram_bot_is_a_class():
    """Tests that TelegramBot is a class object."""
    assert isinstance(TelegramBot, type)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code was very minimal, only defining a constant `MODE` and a class `TelegramBot`.  The tests reflect this, focusing on verifying the existence and type of these elements.  

* **`test_mode_is_string`:** Checks that `MODE` is a string, a fundamental requirement for a string constant.
* **`test_mode_is_valid_string`:**  This test is crucial.  It checks that `MODE` is not empty or `None`, which would cause issues if you tried to use it for comparison or other logic.
* **`test_telegram_bot_exists`:**  Ensures that the `TelegramBot` class is defined and can be found.
* **`test_telegram_bot_is_a_class`:**  Checks that `TelegramBot` is *actually* a class, not some other type of object.


**Important Considerations for More Comprehensive Testing:**

The provided code is too simple for extensive testing.  To write *meaningful* tests for a Python project you need to know what the `TelegramBot` class *does*.


```python
# Example assuming TelegramBot has a __init__ method and a method to send a message.
class TelegramBot:
    def __init__(self, token):
        self.token = token

    def send_message(self, chat_id, message):
        if not isinstance(chat_id, int) or chat_id <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid chat_id")
        # Simulate sending a message
        return f"Message sent to chat {chat_id}: {message}"


def test_telegram_bot_invalid_chat_id():
    """Test that an invalid chat_id raises ValueError"""
    bot = TelegramBot("fake_token")
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
      bot.send_message("abc", "hello")
    assert "Invalid chat_id" in str(excinfo.value)

def test_telegram_bot_valid_chat_id():
    """Test valid chat id with a simple message"""
    bot = TelegramBot("fake_token")
    response = bot.send_message(123, "hello")
    assert response == "Message sent to chat 123: hello"

```

To improve the tests, you'll need to fill in the implementation of the `TelegramBot` class and add more specific and meaningful test cases based on that implementation.  The key is to use pytest to test *actual* behavior.  This example shows how you can test a method, including error handling, using pytest.raises. Remember to include both valid and invalid/edge case inputs for robust testing.
