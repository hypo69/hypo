```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs` and `__file__`:** The crucial addition is mocking the `gs` module and the `__file__` attribute to make the tests independent of the actual file system and external dependencies. This prevents issues like `FileNotFoundError`.

2. **`tmp_path` Fixture:**  Import `pytest` and use `pytest.fixture(tmp_path)` to create temporary directories for testing, which is far superior to trying to manage temporary files directly.

3. **Mock Settings Data:** The `mock_settings_file` fixture provides example settings data, enabling testing different conditions related to the settings.


4. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test names are more descriptive, and the tests are organized better.


5. **Comprehensive Exception Handling:** The tests now explicitly include `pytest.raises` for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to verify proper exception handling.



**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the code as `test_header.py` in a directory that's a subdirectory of your `hypotez/src` directory.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_header.py`.

This improved solution handles edge cases better, ensures testability, and provides a more robust and maintainable test suite.  Remember to replace `"tests/src"` with the actual path to your test files if different.  Also, adjust the `__file__` patching for your exact file setup.
