### Original Code:

```python
# **PROMPT**

## Context:  
You are an advanced analyzer of the `hypotez` project.
Your task: to process and document code following specific formatting and documentation rules. You must generate responses in **Markdown** format (`*.md`), parse input data, generate detailed comments for functions, methods and classes and provide improved code that complies with these instructions.

### **Main Requirements**:
1. **Markdown Format for Responses**:
   - All responses must follow the **Markdown** format. 
   - The output structure should include:
     - **Original Code**: A block with the received code, unmodified.
     - **Improved Code**: A block with enhanced code, formatted and documented.
     - **Changes Made**: A detailed list of modifications and justifications.
   - Code blocks must use the appropriate syntax highlighting tags (e.g., `python`, `markdown`, `json`).

2. **Comment Format**:
   - Use the **reStructuredText (RST)** style for comments and documentation within the code.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def function(param1: str) -> int:
         """
         Function description.
 
         :param param1: Description of the `param1` parameter.
         :type param1: str
         :returns: Description of the return value.
         :rtype: int
         """
         ...
     ```
   - Always provide detailed explanations in comments. Avoid vague terms like *"get"* or *"do"*. Instead, use precise terms such as *"fetch"*, *"validate"*, or *"execute"*.
   - Comments must immediately precede the code block they describe and should explain the block's purpose.

3. **Spacing Around the Assignment Operator**:
   - Always add spaces around the `=` operator for better readability.
   - Examples:
     - **Incorrect**: `x=5`
     - **Correct**: `x = 5`

4. **Use of `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`**:
   - For reading JSON or configuration files, replace standard `open` and `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Incorrect:
     with open('config.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
         data = json.load(f)
 
     # Correct:
     data = j_loads('config.json')
     ```

5. **Preserving Comments**:
   - All existing comments starting with `#` must be preserved unchanged in the "Improved Code" section.
   - If a comment seems outdated or unclear, do not modify it. Instead, note this in the "Changes Made" section.

6. **Handling `...` in Code**:
   - Leave `...` as placeholders in the code unchanged.
   - Do not document lines with `...`.
   - Always insert an ellipsis (...) between logger and return for breakpoints during debugging.

7. **Response Structure**:
   Each response must include the following sections:
   - **Original Code**:
     ```markdown
     <Received input code in an unmodified state.>
     ```
   - **Improved Code**:
     ```markdown
     <The improved version of the code with added comments and formatting.>
     ```
   - **Changes Made**:
     ```markdown
     <A detailed list of all modifications, including explanations and justifications.>
     ```
   - **Optimized Full Code**:
     ```markdown
     <Final, optimized version of the code ready for direct use.>
     ```

8. **Improving Markdown and RST Files**:
   - Analyze `*.md` and `*.rst` files for structure and content.
   - Add TODO directives for future improvements where applicable:
     - Markdown example:
       ```markdown
       <!-- TODO:
       - Add detailed examples.
       - Ensure proper formatting.
       -->
       ```
     - RST example:
       ```rst
       .. TODO::
          - Add a table of contents.
          - Improve descriptions.
       ```

### **Examples**:

#### Example 1 (Python Code):
Input:
```python
def add_numbers(a,b):
    return a+b
```

Expected Response:

```markdown
### Original Code:
```python
def add_numbers(a,b):
    return a+b
```

### Improved Code:
```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two numbers.

    :param a: The first number.
    :type a: int
    :param b: The second number.
    :type b: int
    :returns: The sum of `a` and `b`.
    :rtype: int
    """
    return a + b
```

### Changes Made:
- Added RST-style docstring to document the function.
- Added type annotations for `a` and `b`.
- Added spaces around `+` and parameters in the function definition for readability.

### Optimized Full Code:
```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two numbers.

    :param a: The first number.
    :type a: int
    :param b: The second number.
    :type b: int
    :returns: The sum of `a` and `b`.
    :rtype: int
    """
    return a + b
```
```

### <algorithm>

This code provides a set of requirements for code analysis and improvement. There is no specific algorithm to execute, only guidelines to follow.  The flow is driven by the instructions to transform the input code into better formatted, commented and documented code.


### <mermaid>

No code to generate a mermaid diagram as there is no code to visualize.  The documentation describes guidelines and examples, not executable code.


### <explanation>

The provided code is a set of documentation explaining the expected formatting and commenting rules for code improvement tasks within the `hypotez` project.  It doesn't contain any functional code.  The documentation is for the development guidelines, not executable code.

**Imports**: There are no imports in the given input.

**Classes**: There are no classes defined.

**Functions**: There are no function definitions in this input.

**Variables**: There are no variables.

**Potential Errors or Areas for Improvement**:
There are no errors or areas for improvement because the code is a set of documentation guidelines, not actual code.

**Chain of Relationships**:  This documentation acts as a reference for the codebase, so it establishes a relationship but not a dependency or usage pattern like a functional module.
