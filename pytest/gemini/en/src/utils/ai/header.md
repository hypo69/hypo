**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).
* **Dummy Files:**  Crucially, the tests now create dummy `pyproject.toml` files for testing purposes, ensuring that the actual file system is not modified during the tests.  This is essential for robust testing.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_settings_json_not_found` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check if the `FileNotFoundError` is caught correctly.
* **Mocking:** The test for `settings.json` uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the file system interaction (using the `Path` object). This is significantly better than relying on the actual file system for testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved solution provides more robust, isolated, and accurate tests for your code. Remember to replace placeholders like `dummy_project_root` with the actual paths appropriate to your testing environment. Always clean up any created dummy files after each test run.
