How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code imports all functions from the `base` module located within the `aliexpress.api._examples.iop` subdirectory.  This effectively makes all functions and classes defined within the `base` module accessible within the current module.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports from a module named `base` located within a subdirectory.  The specific path (`aliexpress.api._examples.iop`) suggests this code is part of a larger project focused on AliExpress API interactions, with the `iop` likely referring to some internal, potentially custom, interface.

2. The import is done using `from .base import *`. This is a wildcard import, bringing in everything defined in the `base` module (functions, classes, variables) into the current module's namespace.

3. After import, any functions, classes, or attributes from `base` can be directly used in the current module, eliminating the need to explicitly prefix them with `base.`.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming a 'base' module exists containing functions like:
    # from .base import
    # def my_function():
    #     print("This is a function from the base module")

    # Example usage in the current module:
    from .base import my_function

    my_function()
