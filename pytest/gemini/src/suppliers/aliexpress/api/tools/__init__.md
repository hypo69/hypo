```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now accurately reflect the test scenario (e.g., `test_get_product_id_invalid_url`).

2. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to correctly test exception handling for invalid inputs, like an empty string or `None` as the URL.

3. **Fixture for Data:** Fixtures are added (`valid_product_url`, `invalid_product_url`) to hold valid and invalid URLs, enhancing test clarity and organization.  Crucially, the `invalid_product_url` and `no_product_id_url` fixtures now have more specific meanings for testing.

4. **Edge Cases:** Tests now cover scenarios such as an empty URL, `None` as URL, and, importantly, a scenario where the URL is valid but no product ID is found on the page.

5. **Error Message Checking:**  The error messages are checked using `str(excinfo.value)` to verify the exact error message reported in the exception. This provides a more robust test.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Install pytest:**
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **Replace Placeholders:** The placeholder values like `"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1234567890.html"` and `"invalid_url"` need to be replaced with realistic example inputs,  including edge cases, that test the function's behaviour.

- **Mock `requests` (or other libraries):** If `get_product_id` uses the `requests` library (or any external API), mock the `requests` session or the HTTP response to simulate various HTTP scenarios (success, failure, timeouts, etc.) to isolate your tests from external dependencies, which is good practice. This will allow tests to run consistently and prevent test failures due to network issues.


This revised solution provides a more comprehensive and robust test suite, addressing potential issues and improving code quality. Remember to adapt the example fixtures and placeholders to match the actual logic and inputs of your `get_product_id` function. Remember to mock network calls for production-level testing.
