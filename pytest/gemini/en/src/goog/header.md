**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `__file__`:**  Crucially, the original code used `Path(__file__).resolve()`.  We now mock `__file__` to control the starting path for the tests, which is essential for accurate testing without relying on the real filesystem layout.

2. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_no_marker_file`).

3. **Creating Temporary Directories:**  We create temporary directories (`temp_project_root`, etc.) for each test to avoid interfering with existing project files and ensure isolated tests.  This is vital for reliability.

4. **Handling `__file__`:** The tests now explicitly set the `__file__` value with the correct mocked path.

5. **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):**  Since `set_project_root` doesn't raise exceptions in these test cases, we don't need `pytest.raises`. The expected behavior is verified with assertions instead.

6. **Robustness:**  The test cases now cover various scenarios, including cases where marker files exist in parent directories.

7. **Test for adding to `sys.path`:** A new test `test_set_project_root_sys_path` checks whether the function properly adds the returned Path to the `sys.path`. This is a critical part of the function's behavior and wasn't covered before.


This revised solution provides a much more comprehensive and reliable set of tests. Remember to run `pytest` in the same directory as your test file to execute the tests. Also, make sure the files used in `test_set_project_root_valid_input` exist.  Remove the temporary directories after running the tests to avoid cluttering your filesystem.
