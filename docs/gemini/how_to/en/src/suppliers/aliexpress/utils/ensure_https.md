**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block around `urllib.parse.urlparse(prod_id)`.  This is crucial because `urlparse` can raise exceptions if the input isn't a valid URL.  This prevents the script from crashing and logs the error appropriately.  It also now handles cases where the URL has a scheme (e.g., `ftp`, `mailto`) but it's not `https` or `http`.  This is better than just ignoring such cases, because there may be a reason that they aren't `https`.
* **Robustness:** The code now returns the original input string if `extract_prod_ids` doesn't find a product ID, but it logs the error. This prevents unexpected behavior if there is no product ID to construct a URL for, and clearly identifies that something is wrong.
* **Clarity:** The `ensure_https_single` function is now slightly more efficient by checking for the `https` scheme directly. This avoids the extra parsing and potential error if the input is a fully valid URL with `https`.
* **Documentation:** The docstrings now more clearly indicate that `ValueError` can be raised, especially in the `ensure_https_single` function. The example calls are also improved to cover more cases.


This revised code is more robust, handles errors gracefully, and is better suited for production use. Remember to include the `src.logger` and `extract_product_id` modules in your project for this code to function correctly. Also, consider using a dedicated logging library like `logging` for more advanced logging features. This change to `urllib.parse` is crucial as it gracefully handles potentially invalid URLs.
