**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code imports other modules but doesn't define functions.  The tests are now placeholders, demonstrating the correct structure and how to handle such scenarios.  **Crucially, tests are marked as `skip` using `@pytest.mark.skip`.** This prevents pytest from running these tests if the necessary functions aren't implemented.  **Remove `@pytest.mark.skip` when the functions are implemented.**
* **Specific Tests:** Tests are written for the `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__` attributes, and the `MODE` variable, covering the aspects that are present.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing.  Importantly, it's demonstrating the expected structure to catch the correct exception and check if it has the expected message.
* **Clear Comments:** Comments are added to explain the logic of each test, making the test suite more readable and maintainable.

**How to Use and Adapt:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Remove the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators and replace the placeholder comments and `assert True` statements with your actual test data, assertions, and expected exceptions.
2. **Implement Functionality:** Ensure the modules you're testing (like `locator.py`) contain the actual functions and classes you want to test.
3. **Run Tests:** Run `pytest` in the directory containing the test file and the code modules you are testing.


This improved solution is a template for testing Python modules and demonstrates how to write meaningful tests even when the code being tested isn't complete, including the crucial aspect of properly handling missing functions in unit tests. Remember to replace the placeholder functions and data with the actual code you want to test. Remember to replace placeholder comments with the relevant functions.
