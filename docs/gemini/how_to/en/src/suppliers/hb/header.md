# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/header.py`

This file, `header.py`, provides crucial initialization and configuration for the `hypotez` project. It sets the project root, loads settings from a JSON file, and defines various project metadata variables.

## Key Functions and Variables

**1. `set_project_root(marker_files=...)`**

* **Purpose:** Determines the root directory of the project. It searches upwards from the current file's location for directories containing specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
* **Arguments:**
    * `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names to look for.  Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.
* **Return Value:** A `Path` object representing the project root. If no marker file is found, it returns the directory containing `header.py`.
* **How to use:**  This function is internally called within `header.py` to define the `__root__` variable.  You likely won't need to call it directly.
* **Important:** This function adds the project root to `sys.path` making modules within the project accessible.

**2. Project Root and Settings**

* `__root__`:  A `Path` object representing the project root, crucial for accessing other parts of the project.
    * Determined by the `set_project_root` function.
* `settings`: A dictionary containing project settings.
    * Loaded from `src/settings.json` using `json.load`. If the file is not found or the JSON is invalid, `settings` will be `None`.
    * Ensures you can access settings like `project_name`, `version`, etc. via `settings.get("project_name")`.


**3. Project Metadata**

* `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:  These strings store metadata about the project (e.g., name, version, author, documentation).
* **Initialization:** They are initialized from `settings` or default values if `settings` is `None` or the corresponding key isn't found.   This ensures that variables are always defined.  The default values handle missing keys gracefully, avoiding crashes.
* **Example:** `__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'` will use the project name from `settings.json` if available, otherwise it defaults to `hypotez`.

**4. Docstring Handling**

* `doc_str`: A string containing the project's documentation, if found in `src/README.MD`. If not found or if the file can't be loaded, `doc_str` will be `None`.
* Importantly, metadata is handled with fallbacks. The `if settings` checks ensure that attempts to access `settings` or any key within it only happen if `settings` is not `None`.  This prevents `KeyError` exceptions when the configuration file is missing or has errors.

## Usage Notes

This file is designed to be imported and used by other modules within the `hypotez` project. The variables defined (e.g., `__root__`, `__project_name__`) are readily available to any code that imports `header.py`.  The key idea is to provide consistent access to the project's metadata and path structure.


## Error Handling

The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during file reading. This prevents the script from crashing if the configuration file is missing or corrupted.

## Best Practices


* **Configuration File (`src/settings.json`):**  Ensure this file exists and contains valid JSON data.
* **README.MD:**  Have a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory with useful project documentation.

This comprehensive guide provides a clear understanding of the purpose and function of each component within `header.py`. Remember to adjust the paths and file names if your project structure differs.
