MODE = 'debug'
The code you've provided is good and correctly finds the project root.  It has a few areas where improvements can be made for robustness and clarity.

**Issues and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling (crucial):** The `try...except` blocks for reading `settings.json` are insufficient.  The `FileNotFoundError` is caught, but what if `settings.json` is *corrupted*?  The `json.JSONDecodeError` is better, but there's still a problem.  The catch-all `except Exception as ex:` is *very* broad.  It'll hide *any* other error during file handling that you'd want to see.  It's also useless to print an exception and then do nothing (the `...`).

```python
try:
    with open(__root__ / 'src' / 'settings.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
        project_name = settings.get("project_name", project_name)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")  # More informative error message
    # Consider using a default project_name here or logging
    project_name = project_name #Keep the original project_name if there's an error

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred while loading settings: {e}")
    raise  # Re-raise the exception to alert the calling function
```

* **`sys.path.append` order matters:**  Appending to `sys.path` *after* importing modules might not work as expected.  It's generally best to modify `sys.path` *before* importing any module that might depend on these additional paths.

* **Redundant `__root__` assignment:** Assigning `__root__` to the return value of `find_project_root()` is correct. The additional `__root__ = ...` isn't needed.


* **`sys.path` additions:** The code adds paths for GTK, FFmpeg, and Graphviz.  While the check `if bin_path not in current_paths` is a start, it's prone to errors. Instead of `current_paths`, you could track the paths *before* any modifications.


* **Explicit Encoding:** Always specify the encoding when opening files (`encoding='utf-8'`).

* **`Path` objects:** Always use `Path` objects to create file paths, rather than string concatenation, which can lead to errors and is less readable.


```python
import json
import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

def find_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')):
    # ... (rest of the function is the same)


# ... (other parts of the code)

#paths_to_add = [gtk_bin_path, ffmpeg_bin_path, graphviz_bin_path]

initial_paths = set(Path(p) for p in sys.path) #Save the initial paths before adding any

# ... (finding project root, setting project_name)

paths_to_add = [gtk_bin_path, ffmpeg_bin_path, graphviz_bin_path]


for bin_path in paths_to_add:
    if bin_path.exists() and bin_path not in initial_paths:  #Only add existing paths
        sys.path.insert(0, str(bin_path))

os.environ['WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES'] = str(gtk_bin_path)

# ... (Rest of the code)
```

**Complete and Improved Code:**

```python
import json
import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

def find_project_root(marker_files=('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')):
    current_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    for parent in [current_path] + list(current_path.parents):
        if any((parent / marker).exists() for marker in marker_files):
            return parent
    return current_path

__root__ = find_project_root()
sys.path.append(str(__root__))

initial_paths = set(Path(p) for p in sys.path)

try:
    with open(__root__ / 'src' / 'settings.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)
        project_name = settings.get("project_name", __root__.name)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading settings.json: {e}")
    project_name = __root__.name
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred while loading settings: {e}")
    raise

# Paths to bin directories
gtk_bin_path = __root__ / "bin" / "gtk" / "gtk-nsis-pack" / "bin"
ffmpeg_bin_path = __root__ / "bin" / "ffmpeg" / "bin"
graphviz_bin_path = __root__ / "bin" / "graphviz" / "bin"


for bin_path in [gtk_bin_path, ffmpeg_bin_path, graphviz_bin_path]:
    if bin_path.exists() and bin_path not in initial_paths:
        sys.path.insert(0, str(bin_path))

os.environ['WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES'] = str(gtk_bin_path)

# ... (Rest of the code)

```

This improved version handles errors more robustly, is more efficient, and is more readable. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` tuple to your project's specific structure. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` tuple to your project's specific structure.  Using `try...except` blocks and `raise` statements in such places is crucial to properly handle errors. Always specify the `encoding='utf-8'` when opening files.  Proper error handling is crucial to prevent crashes.
