**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_root_path_extraction`:**  This test now correctly handles the extraction of the root path.  Critically, it uses `Path` to resolve the path correctly, preventing potential errors with relative paths.  It also includes an assertion verifying that "hypotez" is indeed part of the extracted root path, which was missing from the original approach and is a crucial validation step.
   
2. **`test_root_path_extraction_no_hypotez`:** This new test case is crucial for handling the edge case where the "hypotez" directory might not be found.  It uses `pytest.raises` to check if a `ValueError` is raised as expected. This ensures robustness.


3. **`test_path_appending`:** This test verifies that the code correctly appends the calculated root path to `sys.path`. It uses a `try...finally` block to restore the original `sys.path` after the test, preventing unintended side effects on subsequent tests or the overall execution environment. It now also mocks `sys.path` to avoid modifying the real `sys.path`.


4. **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly handle the case where "hypotez" is not found in the path, using `pytest.raises` to assert that the expected exception is raised.


5. **Clarity and Readability:**  Comments are added to explain the logic of each test case, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations:**


*   **Context:** The `__root__` variable is crucial to your code. Ensure it is correctly initialized in your `header.py`. The tests now properly use the `__root__` variable, ensuring correct data.
*   **File Structure:**  The test assumes the `header.py` file is located in a specific folder structure. If your file structure is different, adjust the path finding in the tests accordingly (e.g., using `os.path.join`).
*   **External Dependencies:**  If your code interacts with external libraries or files, you should consider how to mock or isolate those dependencies during testing to avoid issues with external resources.
*  **Environment:** When working with paths, it is recommended to use the `Path` object in Python 3.4 and above, rather than string manipulation methods, for better reliability and avoiding potential issues arising from different operating systems.
