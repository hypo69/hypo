**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **No Python Code:** The provided JavaScript code is irrelevant for Python `pytest` testing.  The placeholder tests above assume a hypothetical Python function (`my_function`) that would need to be replaced with the actual Python code for meaningful testing.
* **Placeholder Assertions:** The assertions (`assert True`) are placeholders.  You need to replace them with the actual assertions based on the expected behavior of the Python function(s).
* **Data:** Make sure to create appropriate test data (e.g., `valid_input`, `invalid_input`, `edge_case_input`, etc.).
* **Exception Handling:** Use `pytest.raises` for verifying that functions raise exceptions as expected.
* **Context:** To give you the most useful tests, you need the Python code.  Focus on the *Python* logic when creating your tests.  The JavaScript code gives you hints about the *intended* functionality, but the actual Python code will define the *actual* implementation to test.

**How to Use These Tests (and example):**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder function names (`my_function`) and assertions with your actual function calls and expected results.
2. **Create Test Data:** Define `valid_input`, `invalid_input`, `edge_case_input`, etc.  Thoroughly cover different scenarios in your tests.
3. **Run Tests:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_try_xpath_check_frame.py`) and run the tests from your terminal using pytest: `pytest test_try_xpath_check_frame.py`.

**Example incorporating the `my_function`**

```python
import pytest


def my_function(input_data):
    if input_data is None:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be None")
    return input_data + 1


def test_my_function_valid_input():
    result = my_function(10)
    assert result == 11
```
