# File: hypotez/src/suppliers/graber.py

This Python file contains the `Graber` class, responsible for extracting product data from web pages (likely for a specific e-commerce platform like Graber).  It uses Selenium (through the `Driver` and `Locator` classes) and utilizes asynchronous operations (asyncio) for efficient web scraping.

## Class `Graber`

This class acts as a base for fetching data from various suppliers.  Critically, it leverages the `Locator` class to abstract the interaction with the web page's elements. This modular design facilitates reuse and maintainability.

**Constructor (`__init__`)**:

- Takes `supplier_prefix` (string): A prefix identifying the data source.
- Takes `locator` (Locator object): An instance of the `Locator` class, containing locators for web elements.
- *Internally stores `l` (Locator):* Stores the locator for easy access throughout the class. This is important for DRY coding.
- Initializes `self.fields` with a `ProductFields` object, used to collect the extracted data.

**Methods**:

* **`error(self, field: str)`**: Handles errors during field extraction. Logs a debug message indicating the failed field.  Improved logging is better than silently failing.

* **`set_field_value(self, value: Any, locator_func: Callable[[], Any], field_name: str, default: Any = '') -> Any`**:
    - A crucial, reusable function for setting field values.
    - Accepts a `locator_func` (a lambda function that returns the element) to retrieve values using locators.  This is the heart of the Graber functionality.
    - Handles potential errors (e.g., missing elements) gracefully.
    - Uses `asyncio.to_thread` to ensure that the element retrieval doesn't block the main thread. This avoids freezing the application during long operations.
    - Returns the extracted value (or a default if nothing found) or handles errors.

* **`grab_page(self) -> ProductFields`**:  The core function for fetching all product data for a given page.
    - **`fetch_all_data(**kwargs)`**: This method is designed to be expanded with your data extraction functions. The current version is a placeholder, and the commented-out `await self.fetch_specific_data(**kwargs)` suggests future expansion.  This is great for extensibility.
    - **Missing Critical Logic**: The `fetch_all_data` function is completely empty, missing the implementation to actually *retrieve the data* from the page.   This is where the core scraping logic needs to be implemented.  Crucially, the function calls other functions like `self.id_product`, etc. that will be needed to gather the data from the HTML.  Importantly, it also seems to be designed to collect data using `kwargs` to pass in additional parameters for the data fetch functions, which is also good for flexibility.  However, a better name for this function might be something like `collect_product_data`.
    - Returns a `ProductFields` object containing all extracted data.


* **Methods like `additional_shipping_cost`, `delivery_in_stock`, etc.**: These methods are specific to Graber and extract values from different locators.
    - Use the `@close_popup` decorator to attempt to close any pop-up windows. This prevents these from interfering with data collection.
    - Call `self.set_field_value` to obtain data and handle errors.
    - **Highly repetitive**:  The repeated `@close_popup`, `async def ...`, `self.set_field_value` pattern is inefficient and cries out for a better abstraction.


**Decorator `close_popup`**:

- A decorator to try and close pop-up windows before executing a function.
- Catches exceptions when trying to close popups. This approach makes the code robust for scenarios where there are no pop-ups or other errors during pop-up interaction.


**Critical Improvements Needed**:

- **Implement `fetch_specific_data` and other data collection functions:**  The core data extraction logic is missing. The method definitions are there, but there are no calls to functions like `self.d.execute_locator` or `self.l.locator_function` with the appropriate locators.
- **Replace the large number of near-identical methods:**  Consolidate the `async def` functions.  There are repeated patterns in these data extraction methods (`set_field_value` and `@close_popup`).  Consider a function that extracts values dynamically based on parameter names.
- **Robust error handling:** While error handling is present, consider more specific exception handling or logging for different types of errors.
- **Type hinting:** Use more descriptive type hints for better code readability and maintainability. For example, return types for `set_field_value`.
- **Clearer variable names:** Some variable names like `d` and `l` are too short.
- **Data validation:** Implement validation to ensure that the data extracted is in the expected format.
- **Global Variables:** Using global variables `d` and `l` is not ideal.  Consider passing them to the class instances.  This is a simple change that can improve code organization.


**Overall:** The code has a good structure for an asynchronous web scraper. However, implementing the core data collection logic and optimizing it for better maintainability, efficiency, and robustness is crucial for a functional scraper.
