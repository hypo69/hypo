```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `Driver` class and the `save_png` function. This isolates the tests from the actual WebDriver interaction and the file system operations.  Crucially, it mocks the `execute_locator` method to simulate different scenarios.

2. **Fixture for Driver:**  A `mock_driver` fixture is created to provide a mock driver instance to the `Graber` class, making the test more controlled.

3. **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly check for exceptions and ensure that the `Graber` class handles them appropriately.  `test_grab_page_no_image` is a good example of this improved error handling.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and focused on the expected outcomes.

5. **Edge Cases:**  `test_grab_page_no_image` and `test_local_saved_image_no_image_data` are added to cover cases where image data might not be available or saving might fail.

6. **`ProductFields` fixture:**  A `product_fields` fixture is created to provide a pre-populated `ProductFields` object, necessary for methods like `local_saved_image` that require a field to save to.

7. **Asynchronous Tests:**  The `asyncio.run` is essential to properly execute the asynchronous functions (`grab_page`, `local_saved_image`) in a synchronous testing context.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Replace the placeholder imports (`from ... import ...`) with the actual module paths from your project.
3.  Run `pytest` in your terminal.

**Important Considerations:**

-   **Real Driver:**  For production-quality tests, replace the mocks with actual webdriver interactions. You'll likely need to set up a proper `Driver` fixture and use `pytest-asyncio` to run your asynchronous tests correctly.
-   **File Handling:**  In production, handle file paths (and errors) more robustly when saving images. The mocked file handling is enough for testing the core logic of your graber class, not the file system.  Consider using temporary directories for your test files.
-   **Error Handling Refinement:** The mock error handling in the tests is a good start, but consider different types of exceptions and edge cases for more thorough coverage.
- **`id_product` Issue:** The code has a hardcoded call to `id_product` in `local_saved_image`.  You will need to pass `id_product` to `grab_product_page` or the relevant method, and then handle it within that method properly. The comment is there for a reason.  Tests for this are lacking, and addressing this should be part of your test strategy.


Remember to add tests for other methods in your class as necessary to achieve comprehensive test coverage. This expanded example demonstrates the improved approach using `pytest` for asynchronous and complex Python code.
