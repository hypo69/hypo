**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Modules:** The code now imports `Path` from `pathlib` and `set_project_root` from the `hypotez.src.logger.header` file to properly test the target function.

2. **Dummy File Creation:** The tests now use `Path.touch()` to create temporary files for testing scenarios, which is a safer approach.  Crucially, this code also *removes* the files after use. This prevents tests from being affected by files from previous runs and ensures the tests operate in a clean state.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

4. **Edge Case Test (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`):** A test was added to cover the situation where no marker files are found.

5. **Custom Marker Files:** A `test_set_project_root_with_custom_marker_files` test was added to verify the function handles custom marker files correctly.

6. **Error Handling:** The original code contained `...` placeholders for error handling. You should *replace those with appropriate pytest assertions to check for the expected exceptions (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError)*.  The provided tests do *not* cover error handling in the function.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Project Structure:** The provided `header.py` code assumes a specific project structure (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `README.MD`). If this structure isn't present during testing, your test cases might fail. In general, test data should be isolated from the test context (e.g., file creation) to minimize unwanted side effects.

* **`gs` Module:** The code utilizes `gs.path.root`.  You need to mock or stub this part to write testable tests that don't rely on the external module's real functionality.

* **Error Handling in `set_project_root`:** The current test suite does not cover the error handling within the `set_project_root` function itself, such as handling cases where the marker files don't exist in the project's directory hierarchy. This would be done in additional tests for exceptional scenarios.


To make the tests more robust, consider mocking the `gs` module or creating a dummy `gs` module for testing that returns the correct paths. The tests now provide a more comprehensive and complete framework to cover the function's different use cases. Remember to replace `...` placeholders with proper error checking. Remember also to replace the placeholder `...` within the `header.py` to handle FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError to achieve complete error handling.
