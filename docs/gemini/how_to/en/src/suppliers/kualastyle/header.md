# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/kualastyle/header.py`

This file, `header.py`, sets up the project environment and loads configuration data for the `hypotez` project. It's crucial for initial setup and ensuring proper imports.

## Functionality

The script performs the following key tasks:

1. **Finds the Project Root:**
   - `set_project_root()`: This function searches up from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).
   - It returns the path to this root directory. Crucially, it also adds this root directory to `sys.path` allowing correct imports.  This is essential for projects with modular structures.

2. **Loads Project Configuration:**
   - It attempts to load a JSON configuration file named `settings.json` located in the `src` directory of the project root.
   - It handles potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions gracefully, preventing the script from crashing if the configuration file is missing or corrupted.

3. **Loads Project Documentation:**
   - It attempts to load a README file in Markdown format (`README.MD`) from the project root's `src` directory.

4. **Extracts Project Metadata:**
   - It extracts various project metadata items like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, and `__cofee__` (a custom field) from the loaded `settings.json` file.
   - **Important:** If `settings.json` is not found, defaults are used. This safeguards against issues where configuration isn't available.


## Usage Example (Indirect):

You typically don't directly call this file. It's a utility module used at the beginning of other modules within the `hypotez` project.  Other modules that need to access configuration or the project root will import from `src` as shown in the example.


```python
# Example usage (in another module)
from src import gs
import header

# Access project root
project_root = header.__root__  # Access project root using the variable.


# Access configurations (e.g., project name)
project_name = header.__project_name__
```


## Important Considerations

* **Error Handling:** The use of `try...except` blocks is crucial for robustness.  The code gracefully handles missing or invalid configuration files.
* **Project Structure:**  The code assumes a specific directory structure (`src/settings.json`, `src/README.MD`). Ensure your project follows this structure for the code to function correctly.
* **`sys.path` Modification:** Adding the project root to `sys.path` is vital. It allows Python to find modules within your project, which is standard practice for larger Python projects.
* **Dependencies:**  The use of `packaging.version` indicates that the project has a dependency and assumes this module is installed.
