<h1>Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/scenarios/login.py</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module contains functions related to logging into AliExpress using a Selenium WebDriver.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<h3><code>MODE</code></h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Defines the operation mode (currently 'dev').</p>


<h2>Functions</h2>

<h3><code>login</code></h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Logs into AliExpress via webdriver.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>s</code> (`Supplier`): The Supplier object with the running driver.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Returns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>bool</code>: Returns True if the login was successful, otherwise False.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Raises</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>N/A:  No exceptions explicitly documented.  Potential exceptions from Selenium or other libraries should be included in a more comprehensive implementation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Detailed Description</strong>:</p>
<p>The function takes a Supplier object as input, assuming it has a driver instance and locators for various login elements. It navigates to AliExpress, potentially accepts cookies, finds the login elements (email, password, login button), and attempts to enter credentials and submit the form. The code includes placeholders (`... # TODO`) to indicate missing error handling.  Crucially, the return statement is currently set to `True` for debugging; this should be changed to a more realistic outcome based on successful login/error.</p>

<p><strong>Important Notes</strong>:  The function assumes that the necessary locators are available in the Supplier object. It also doesn't incorporate proper error handling or logging.  Robust exception handling, logging for debugging, and more detailed error reporting are crucial for production-level code.</p>
