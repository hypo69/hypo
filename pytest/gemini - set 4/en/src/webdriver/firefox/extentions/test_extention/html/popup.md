```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  The provided HTML is
# a web page, not Python code.

# If there were Python code (e.g., a function to parse or interact
# with this HTML file), tests could be written here.  For example:

# Example (hypothetical) Python code to test:
#
# def get_title(html_content):
#     """Extracts the title from the given HTML content."""
#     # ... (code to parse HTML and extract title) ...
#     # Example using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing:
#     from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#     soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
#     title_tag = soup.title
#     if title_tag:
#         return title_tag.string
#     else:
#         return None
#
#
# def test_get_title_valid_input():
#     html = """<!DOCTYPE html>
#     <html lang="en">
#     <head>
#         <title>My Title</title>
#     </head>
#     <body>
#     </body>
#     </html>"""
#     assert get_title(html) == "My Title"
#
# def test_get_title_no_title():
#     html = """<!DOCTYPE html>
#     <html lang="en">
#     <body>
#     </body>
#     </html>"""
#     assert get_title(html) is None
#
# def test_get_title_invalid_html():
#     with pytest.raises(Exception):  # Or a more specific exception if needed
#         get_title("Invalid HTML")
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file is a webpage, not Python code.  Therefore, no testing of Python functions is possible directly from this HTML.

* **Missing Python Code:**  To write meaningful `pytest` tests, you need Python code that interacts with or processes the HTML. For example, a function that extracts data from the HTML, parses it, or manipulates it.
* **Hypothetical Example:** The commented-out example shows a function (`get_title`) that parses HTML. The corresponding tests verify that the function returns the expected title for valid HTML, handles cases with no title, and raises an exception for invalid HTML.
* **Robust Testing:**  If you have Python code that works with this HTML, ensure your tests cover:
    * **Valid Inputs:**  Normal use cases with expected output.
    * **Invalid/Unexpected Inputs:** Cases where the input is malformed or doesn't match expected structure.
    * **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions (e.g., empty strings, very long strings, special characters).
    * **Error Handling:** Implement tests to check if your code gracefully handles exceptions. Use `pytest.raises` to assert that expected exceptions are raised when needed.
    * **Data-driven Tests (if applicable):**  If your code processes different types of HTML, consider using parameterized tests with various inputs to enhance test coverage.

**How to Use This Example:**

1.  Replace the hypothetical Python code with your actual Python code that processes or interacts with the HTML file.
2.  Add tests that verify that the code behaves as expected for various inputs, including invalid/unexpected inputs and edge cases.
3.  Make sure your test code adheres to `pytest` best practices, like using clear test names and well-defined assertions.
