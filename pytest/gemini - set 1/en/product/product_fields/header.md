**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Introduced `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing. This isolates the tests and avoids relying on actual files, making them more robust.
* **Error Handling:**  Tests now include checks for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` using `pytest.raises`, ensuring the code handles those cases correctly.
* **Parametrization:** The `test_get_project_root_multiple_markers` function now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` for more concise testing of different marker files.
* **Edge Cases:** The tests now include cases where the project root isn't directly in the current directory (tested with a parent directory) and no marker files are found.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more explicit, making the intent of the tests more clear.
* **Dummy Data:** Used `dummy_settings_json` to provide sample data for the `settings.json` file, removing the need for an external file.
* **Mocking `sys.path` (Important):**  While you can't directly mock `sys.path` in the standard way, the `test_get_project_root_adds_to_sys_path` function now verifies that the function correctly modifies the `sys.path` in-place.
* **Correct `__root__` handling in tests:** The tests now verify that `__root__` is correctly assigned within the function.


This revised solution provides more comprehensive tests that cover a broader range of scenarios and are more robust. Remember to replace `'src'` and `'settings.json'` with the actual paths if you use them in the project.  Importantly, the tests now use temporary directories, ensuring that the test does not modify the project files, making them safe and reproducible. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, and `json`.
