# hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/start_sergey.py

## Overview

This module defines functions for launching Facebook advertisement campaigns. It handles campaign setup, execution, and management, supporting multiple languages and currencies. The module utilizes a Facebook advertisement promoter class for interaction with the Facebook advertising platform. It also incorporates error handling and logging for robustness.

## Functions

### `run_campaign`

**Description**: Launches a specific advertisement campaign.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the webdriver, needed to interact with the Facebook platform.
- `promoter_name` (str): The name of the advertiser.
- `campaigns` (list): A list of campaign names.
- `group_file_paths` (list): A list of file paths containing information about target groups.
- `language` (str): The language of the campaign.
- `currency` (str): The currency of the campaign.

**Returns**:

- None: This function does not explicitly return a value.

**Raises**:

- None: No exceptions are explicitly raised in the function's definition.  It's implied that exceptions from the `FacebookPromoter` class could be raised during campaign execution.


### `campaign_cycle`

**Description**: Manages the cycle of launching various advertisement campaigns.

**Parameters**:

- `d` (Driver): An instance of the webdriver, needed to interact with the Facebook platform.


**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the campaign cycle completes successfully, otherwise, it is not specified.


**Raises**:

- None:  No exceptions are explicitly raised in the function's definition.  It's possible that exceptions from other modules or functions that `campaign_cycle` calls (e.g., `run_campaign`) could be raised.


### `main`

**Description**: The main function that orcheStartes campaign execution, error handling, and logging.

**Parameters**:

- None

**Returns**:

- None: This function does not explicitly return a value.

**Raises**:

- `KeyboardInterrupt`:  Raised if the user interrupts the campaign execution.
- (Implied): Exceptions from other modules or functions called within `main`, like `Driver` or `FacebookPromoter`


## Global Variables

- `MODE`: A string variable representing the execution mode (likely 'dev').
- `group_file_paths_ru`, `adv_file_paths_ru`, `group_file_paths_he`, `adv_file_paths_he`: Lists of file paths containing advertisement data for different languages (Russian and Hebrew).
- `group_categories_to_adv`: List of categories for advertisements targeting.
- `language_currency_pairs`: A list of dictionaries with language (HE,RU) as keys and currency (ILS) as value.  This structure is a bit unusual; it's possible the original intent was more complex.
