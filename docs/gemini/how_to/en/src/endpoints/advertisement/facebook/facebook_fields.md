## Usage Guide for `facebook_fields.py`

This Python script, `facebook_fields.py`, defines a class `FacebookFields` for retrieving and storing Facebook advertisement and event fields.  It reads a JSON configuration file (`facebook_feilds.json`) to populate the object with these fields.

**File:** `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/facebook_fields.py`

**Purpose:** To provide a structured way to access Facebook advertisement and event fields defined in a JSON file.

**How to Use:**

1. **Import the Class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.facebook_fields import FacebookFields
```

2. **Instantiate the `FacebookFields` Object:**

```python
fb_fields = FacebookFields()
```

This creates an instance of the `FacebookFields` class.  Crucially, this triggers the initialization process, reading the JSON data and populating the object's attributes.


3. **Access Fields:**

Once initialized, you can access the fields as attributes of the `fb_fields` object:

```python
# Example: Assuming "ad_name" exists in the JSON file
ad_name = fb_fields.ad_name
```


**Error Handling and Debugging:**

* **File Not Found:** If the `facebook_feilds.json` file is missing or cannot be read, a debug message is logged, and the method returns `None`.  This is critical for robust applications.  Carefully check the location of this file to ensure it exists.  The path is constructed using `gs.path.src/advertisement/facebok/facebook_feilds.json`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path.src`:** This variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere (likely in a module like `src/utils/paths.py` or a similar file).  It holds the path to the source directory.  Ensure this is correctly configured.

* **`facebook_feilds.json`:**  This JSON file should contain key-value pairs representing the Facebook advertisement and event fields.  The keys will become the attribute names of the `FacebookFields` object.

* **Data Format:** The `facebook_feilds.json` file should be structured like this:

```json
{
  "ad_name": "Example Ad Name",
  "target_audience": "Young Professionals",
  "budget": 1000,
  "event_date": "2024-10-27"
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Example Usage within a Larger Application:**

```python
# ... (Import necessary modules, including FacebookFields)

# ... (Other parts of your application)

fb_fields = FacebookFields()

if fb_fields:
  ad_name = fb_fields.ad_name
  target_audience = fb_fields.target_audience
  # ... use the retrieved fields for your Facebook API calls
  # ...
else:
  logger.error("Failed to load Facebook fields. Check the file and path.")
```

This example shows how to handle potential errors.  Always check if the `fb_fields` object is valid before accessing its attributes to prevent exceptions.


**Recommendation:**  Add more robust error handling and logging to the `_payload` method to identify specific problems with the JSON file format or data.
