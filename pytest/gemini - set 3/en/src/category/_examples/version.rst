**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the property they are testing (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_value`).

2. **Type Checking:** Includes assertions to verify the expected data types of `__version__`, `__details__`, and `__name__` to catch potential errors where these attributes are not strings.

3. **Edge Case Handling (for __name__):**  The crucial addition is the handling of the `__name__` attribute.  The `test_name_value` test now checks if the script is being run directly (`__name__ == "__main__"`) or imported (`__name__ == "hypotez.src.category._examples.version"`). This addresses the potential difference in `__name__` depending on how the module is used.  The try/except block robustly handles cases where the import might fail.

4. **Docstrings for Tests:**  Docstrings are added to all tests to explain their purpose.


5. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:**  The provided code does not require fixtures, so no fixture definitions are needed.  I avoided adding ones just for demonstration sake.


This revised test suite is more comprehensive, covers edge cases, and is more robust in dealing with the expected behavior differences when running the script directly versus importing it.  The test coverage is now complete for the properties given, which was the main issue with the previous version. Remember to save the tests in a file named `test_version.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as the `version.py` file. Then, you can run `pytest test_version.py` to execute the tests.
