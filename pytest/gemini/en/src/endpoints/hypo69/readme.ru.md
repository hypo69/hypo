**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **No Code Provided:** The input only describes modules, not actual Python code. The example tests are *hypothetical* and need to be adapted based on the real functions.  Replace placeholders (`# Replace with ...`) with the actual code and expected outputs.

2. **Error Handling (Exceptions):**  `pytest.raises` is crucial for testing exceptions. The example shows how to test for `TypeError` and `ValueError`.  Make sure your tests check for exceptions that your code might raise for invalid input.

3. **Clear Assertions:**  Use `assert` statements to verify that the function returns the expected values.  Do not simply check for `True` or `False`.  Test for specific string values, lists, or other data types returned by your functions.

4. **Edge Cases:** Consider cases like empty strings, large inputs, unexpected types, etc.  The example includes tests for empty input and invalid types.

5. **Fixtures:** If your functions require data or setup, define fixtures (as shown in the example template) to create this data within the test scope.

6. **Descriptive Test Names:** Use descriptive names like `test_function_valid_input`, `test_function_invalid_type`, to easily understand the purpose of each test.

**How to Use with Your Actual Code:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Change the placeholder function calls, expected outputs, and error messages to correspond to your code.
2. **Add Tests:** Create new test functions for every function, method, or class in your code.
3. **Run Tests:** Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest`.


**Example with actual Python code (Example):**

```python
# Hypothetical code
def small_talk_bot(message):
  if not isinstance(message, str):
    raise TypeError("Invalid input type")
  if message.lower() == "hello":
    return "Hi there!"
  elif message.lower() == "goodbye":
    return "See you later!"
  else:
    raise ValueError("Command not recognized")
```

```python
# Corresponding tests (using the example code)
import pytest

def test_small_talk_bot_hello():
  assert small_talk_bot("hello") == "Hi there!"

# ... (other test functions as shown previously)
```
