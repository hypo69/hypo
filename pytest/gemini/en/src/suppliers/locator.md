**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Driver:** The code now uses placeholders (`driver = "mock_driver"`) to represent the WebDriver initialization.  Crucially, these are *not* actual driver instances; this is essential for testing the logic *without* needing a real browser running.  Replace these with your actual driver setup.

2. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Added more descriptive test names and comments within the tests.

3. **Realistic Assertions:** Instead of just checking for `is_displayed()`, added checks like `assert len(elements) > 0` to verify list content.  Crucially, added a test to check if the text retrieved from the `id_supplier` locator is not empty.

4. **Mandatory Locator Test:** Added a test (`test_locator_mandatory_failure`) to demonstrate how to handle scenarios where a mandatory locator fails to find the element (using `pytest.raises`).

5. **Edge Case Example:** Added a test (`test_locator_complex_list_first`) to illustrate how you might handle a list of locators.  This example checks for the existence and content of the first element. Remember to add your own specific edge cases.

6. **Error Handling:**  The test now includes an assertion `assert "Element not found" in str(excinfo.value)` to check for a specific error message instead of a generic exception.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute `"mock_driver"` with your actual WebDriver initialization code.
2. **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
3. **Run Tests:** Run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the test suite.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now shows error handling with `pytest.raises`.  You'll need to adapt it to handle the specific exceptions your code throws when a locator is not found or if there's an error retrieving the attribute.
* **Data Loading:** The `LOCATORS` dictionary is a placeholder.  You'll need to load your actual locator data from the file (likely using `json.load()`).
* **Real Browser Interactions:**  These tests are now much more robust and helpful for understanding if locators are working in your codebase, but are *not* comprehensive enough to guarantee that your tests will work in *all* scenarios.   To make the test suite comprehensive, you would need to consider more corner case scenarios (e.g., different browser versions, dynamic content, etc.).
