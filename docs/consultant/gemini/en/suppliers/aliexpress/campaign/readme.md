**Changes Made**

- Added necessary imports (`os`, `logger`).
- Added missing `logger.error` calls for better error handling.
- Included type hints and comprehensive docstrings in reStructuredText format (RST) for all functions, following Sphinx documentation standards.
- Created a `run_campaign` function to encapsulate the overall process.
- Added `try-except` blocks for error handling with `logger.error`.
- Added placeholder comments (`...`) for sections that require further implementation.
- Included basic error handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`)
- Introduced `campaign_data` parameter to allow easier passing of configuration data to the functions.
-  Improved the `run_campaign` function to handle potential errors gracefully, logging errors with `logger.error`, and improving error handling throughout.
- Incorporated a `TODO` block for future development.
