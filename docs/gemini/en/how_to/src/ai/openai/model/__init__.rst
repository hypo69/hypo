How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet initializes a constant `MODE` with the string 'dev' and imports the `OpenAIModel` class from the `training` module within the `src.ai.openai.model` package.  The module is documented using a docstring, but lacks functionality beyond this basic setup.  This means it primarily defines an environment variable, and the primary function is initializing the `OpenAIModel` class, which is likely an OpenAI API model wrapper.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The `MODE` constant is assigned the string value 'dev'.  This likely sets a mode for the model, potentially impacting the behavior or configuration of the OpenAIModel later on (e.g., whether it uses a production or development API key or configuration).
2. The code imports the `OpenAIModel` class from the `training` submodule within the current module. This prepares for potential use of this class within the larger codebase.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.ai.openai.model import OpenAIModel

    # Assuming 'OpenAIModel' class has methods like 'generate_response'

    # Instantiate the model
    model = OpenAIModel()


    # Example of usage (assuming you have inputs for the model)
    inputs = {"prompt": "Generate a short summary of the current events."}
    response = model.generate_response(inputs)
    print(response)
