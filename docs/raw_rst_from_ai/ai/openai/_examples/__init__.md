```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to functions (`run_example_1`, `run_example_2`, `get_version_info`).  This is crucial for documentation. Docstrings should clearly explain what the function does, what arguments it takes, what it returns, and any potential exceptions.
* **Placeholder Example Code:** Included example functions (`run_example_1`, `run_example_2`).  These are just placeholders; you need to replace them with the actual OpenAI API calls and logic for your examples.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block to `run_example_1` to demonstrate how to handle potential errors during the API call. This prevents the script from crashing if something goes wrong.
* **Version Information Access:** Added a `get_version_info` function to show how to use the `__version__`, `__details__`, and `__doc__` variables.
* **Module Structure:**  The file now has a structure suitable for including useful examples (e.g., multiple examples in one file).
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is organized to clearly separate the example functions from the version information.
* **Potential Exception Handling in run_example_2:** Added basic error handling (a `raise Exception` and `if False`) for `run_example_2` to demonstrate good practice.


**How to use the example functions:**

```python
from hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples import run_example_1, run_example_2, get_version_info

# Example usage of run_example_1
result = run_example_1()
print(result)

# Example usage of run_example_2
try:
  result = run_example_2()
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error in run_example_2: {e}")
  
#Example access to version info
version_data = get_version_info()
print(version_data)

```

**Crucial Next Steps:**

Replace the placeholder example code (`run_example_1`, `run_example_2`, etc.) with your actual OpenAI API calls.  Provide meaningful context and expected output for the examples.  The improved structure makes it easy to add, modify, or remove examples as needed. Also, you need to define the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` variables in your `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/version.py` file.  Make sure the file paths (`hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/version.py`) and import statements are correct for your project setup.
