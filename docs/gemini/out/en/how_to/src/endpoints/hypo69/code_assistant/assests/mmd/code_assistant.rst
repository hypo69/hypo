How to use the code block for code assistant initialization and processing
=======================================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block describes the initialization and processing steps of a code assistant.  It visualizes the process flow using a graph, outlining how the assistant loads configurations, initializes models, parses arguments, processes files, handles interruptions, and saves responses.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The `CodeAssistant` object is created (A).  It then loads configuration (B), initializes Gemini and OpenAI models (C).  These models (D & E) are crucial for processing.

2. **Argument Parsing:** The `parse_args` function (F) processes command-line or configuration file arguments, extracting user inputs (G).

3. **File Processing:**  The extracted arguments trigger the `_yield_files_content` function (H) to fetch the content of input files (I).  The content is then used to construct a request object (_create_request - J), sent to the `GeminiModel` (K).

4. **Response Processing:** The `GeminiModel` processes the request (L).  The model's response is sanitized (_remove_outer_quotes - M) before being saved (_save_response - N). The resulting response (O) is displayed (P).


5. **Error Handling (Alternative Path):** If an error occurs during processing in the `GeminiModel` (L), an error message is logged (Q) through the function `_log_error`, following an alternative execution path, as represented by the 'alt' subgraph.

6. **Interrupt Handling:** The code also includes a path for handling interruptions (Ctrl+C) (_signal_handler - S) to properly manage the process (T).

7. **Processing Loop:**  Finally, the result is displayed (P) and the process cycles back to the beginning (U), continuing the processing cycle (A).


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (Example usage would depend on the actual code the graph represents)
    # This is a placeholder as the provided code is a graph, not executable code.
    # To generate a usage example, the actual Python code corresponding to the graph would be needed.
    # For instance, you'd need to show how to instantiate the CodeAssistant class,
    # pass arguments, specify input files, and handle the returned responses.
