**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now utilizes `unittest.mock.patch` to mock external dependencies like `requests.get`, `AudioSegment`, and `gTTS`.  This is crucial for testing functions that interact with external services or libraries without relying on actual network requests or file I/O. This prevents flaky tests.

* **Error Handling:** The tests now include more comprehensive error handling.  The `test_speech_recognizer_invalid_audio_file` and `test_speech_recognizer_invalid_audio_url` tests demonstrate handling `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and other potential errors.  It also now checks for the expected error strings in the results.

* **Valid/Invalid Input:**  Tests include scenarios with both valid and invalid audio file paths and URLs.

* **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive.

* **Temporary Files:**  The `audio_file_path` fixture now creates a temporary file, so tests don't interfere with each other or leave files on the system.

* **Mocking `logger`:** A `mock_logger` fixture is introduced to properly mock the `logger` object. This is important for isolating the tests and ensuring that they only test the logic of the functions, not the effects of logging.

* **`asyncio` handling**: The `text2speech` test was updated to use `asyncio.run` to properly run the asynchronous function.

* **Edge Cases**: Added a test for when `AudioSegment` raises an exception.

* **`pytest.raises`:**  Used `pytest.raises` for the exception test of `text2speech` function.


**How to run:**

Make sure you have `pytest` installed.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_tts.py`) in the same directory as your `tts.py` file, and then run `pytest test_tts.py`.  


**Important:**

Replace `"https://example.com/audio.ogg"` with a real, valid audio URL if possible for a more robust test. Replace the dummy audio data in `audio_file_path` with a small, real audio file, if available, for further testing.   Ensure that `speech_recognition` and `pydub` are properly installed for your environment.  If not, uncomment the following and run pip:

```python
# pip install speech_recognition pydub requests
```
