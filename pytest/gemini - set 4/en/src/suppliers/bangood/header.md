```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Fixture:** The `test_data_dir` fixture now creates a temporary directory with `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files, which is crucial for testing `set_project_root` effectively.
* **Comprehensive `set_project_root` Tests:** Added tests for various scenarios:
    * Valid input (files in the same directory).
    * Valid input (files in the parent directory).
    * No marker files found.
    * Marker files not found.
    * Handles cases where no root directory is found.
* **Robust Exception Handling:** Includes `pytest.raises` for `FileNotFoundError` and `AttributeError` tests for `set_project_root` and file loading.
* **File Existence Check:** The `test_settings_file_exists` now skips the test if the settings.json file is not found to avoid failing the entire suite.
* **Realistic Test Cases:** Added more test cases that cover different possibilities in `set_project_root`.
* **Mocking (monkeypatching):** Used `monkeypatch` to mock `settings` in the `__project_name__` tests. This isolates the test from external settings and avoids the need to actually create the `settings.json` file every time.
* **Missing Files:**  Tests are added to handle the case where `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing (i.e., they don't exist).
* **sys.path Modification:** The  `test_set_project_root_...` tests are updated to not modify sys.path globally


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.path.root`:** This code imports `gs` from another file.  You will need to provide the code for that import (i.e., the code defining `gs`) so the tests can be fully executed.
* **`settings.json` and `README.MD`:** The example tests now include handling the situation where these files might not exist. You may need to adapt these tests based on the actual expected behavior.
* **Dependencies:**  Make sure your test environment has the necessary dependencies (`packaging`).


Remember to expand the test cases to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases within the `header.py` code for a more comprehensive test suite.
