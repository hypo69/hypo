**Explanation and Important Considerations (even without the input code):**

1. **Import `pytest`:**  The code starts by importing the `pytest` library.

2. **Example Functions:**  The example code now includes `add_numbers` and `calculate_average` functions.  You'll replace these with your actual functions.

3. **Test Function Names:** Test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_add_numbers_valid_input`).

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The code uses `with pytest.raises(TypeError):` to test for specific exception types.  Crucially, this checks for correct error handling in your functions. This is **essential** for robust tests.

5. **Clear Assertions:** The `assert` statements verify that the functions return the expected output for various inputs.


6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**  The example tests include cases like an empty list for `calculate_average`, which is an important edge case.   You should add more edge cases and boundary conditions based on your functions.


7. **Error Handling:** Test functions that are supposed to raise exceptions when given invalid input. This ensures that your code handles invalid data as expected.


**Critical for your actual tests:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  Replace the example functions (`add_numbers`, `calculate_average`) and the example test cases with your actual code and corresponding test cases.
* **Analyze Input:** Thoroughly examine the inputs, outputs, and any potential edge cases of the code you want to test.
* **Complete Test Coverage:** Aim to cover all aspects of your code, including normal cases, invalid inputs, edge cases, boundary conditions, and exception handling.
* **Fixture:** If your function needs input data, use a fixture to create it to ensure test isolation and avoid creating data in each test function.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_my_code.py`).
2. Run the tests using the command `pytest test_my_code.py` in your terminal.


Provide the actual Python code, and I can create much more specific and relevant tests. Remember to give input types and expected outputs.
