**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Dummy Data:**  Crucially, the `dummy_settings_file` and `dummy_readme_file` fixtures provide the necessary test data without relying on external files, making the tests self-contained and reproducible.
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Uses `pytest.tmp_path` for creating temporary directories, removing the need to manually delete files, which is crucial for testing.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names like `test_set_project_root_valid_input` are more descriptive.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests for cases where marker files don't exist, are not in the expected locations (e.g. `test_set_project_root_marker_not_exist`), or when the root directory isn't already in `sys.path`.
* **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, which are important for robustness.
* **`monkeypatch`:** Added `monkeypatch` to mock the `__file__` attribute. This is crucial, as the original code directly accesses `__file__`, potentially causing issues during testing due to the test environment.
* **Realistic Testing:** Includes testing for valid input and scenarios where the root file is correctly found.
* **`sys.path` Consideration:** The code now tests whether the root directory is added to `sys.path` if it's not already present, which is a crucial aspect of the function.

This revised solution is more robust and thoroughly tests the `set_project_root` function, ensuring correct behavior under various conditions. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `pathlib`, `packaging`) before running the tests.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
