```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Methods:** The tests assume the existence of methods like `get_row`, `get_column`, `get_data`, etc., within the `SpreadSheet` class. You **must** replace these placeholders with the actual method names from your `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet.py` file.

2. **`sample_data` Fixture:** This fixture provides a standardized dataset for testing.  Crucially, it ensures that test cases are consistent.

3. **`pytest.raises`:**  The `test_spreadsheet_get_row_invalid_index` and `test_spreadsheet_get_column_invalid_index` examples demonStarte how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (e.g., `IndexError`).

4. **Comprehensive Testing:** The examples provide a basic structure.  Add more tests covering:
   - **Error Handling:**  Test for empty spreadsheets, invalid input data types, and other potential errors.
   - **Edge Cases:** Test with a single row, a single column, or very large datasets.
   - **Specific Requirements:**  If your `SpreadSheet` class has specific requirements, test them.

5. **`spreadsheet.get_num_rows` and `spreadsheet.get_num_columns`:** Added example tests to verify that these methods return correct values when dealing with spreadsheet data.


6. **Missing `spreadsheet.py`:**  The provided code only imports `SpreadSheet`, not the definition of the class.  To make the tests runnable, you need the actual `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet.py` file defining the `SpreadSheet` class and its methods.  This code provides a framework; adapt it to your actual methods.


By filling in the appropriate method names and adding more test cases, you can create a comprehensive test suite for your `SpreadSheet` class. Remember to replace the example methods (`get_row`, `get_column`) with the actual method names from your code. Remember to run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.
