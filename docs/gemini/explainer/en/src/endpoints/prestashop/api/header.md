```

**Data Flow:**

1. The `set_project_root` function is called with a tuple of marker files.
2. It iterates through parent directories starting from the current file's location.
3. It checks if any of the marker files exist in the current directory.
4. If found, it sets `__root__` to the parent directory and breaks out of the loop.
5. Otherwise, it continues searching up the directory tree.
6. It adds the root directory to `sys.path` if it isn't already present.
7. It returns the calculated `__root__`.
8. The calculated `__root__` is used in subsequent code to construct file paths.
9. This file loads the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files to populate variables used in other parts of the project.

**Examples:**

- If `pyproject.toml` exists in the parent directory, `__root__` is set to the parent directory.

- If no marker files are found in any of the parent directories, `__root__` remains the directory where the script is located.


```

<explanation>

**Imports:**

- `sys`: Used for interacting with the Python interpreter system, in this case to manipulate `sys.path` to allow importing modules from a specific directory.
- `json`: Used for encoding and decoding JSON data, specifically to load configuration data from the `settings.json` file.
- `packaging.version`: Used for properly handling versions, though the code does not use this in a meaningful way here.
- `pathlib`: Used to represent file paths in an object-oriented way; significantly improves code readability and maintainability, compared to string-based manipulation.

**Classes:**
- None.  This file primarily deals with functions and data.

**Functions:**

- `set_project_root(marker_files)`:
    - Takes a tuple of file/directory names (`marker_files`) as input.
    - Recursively traverses the parent directories to find the project root directory based on these marker files.
    - Inserts the project root directory into `sys.path` for proper module imports.
    - Returns the found project root directory (`Path` object).


**Variables:**

- `MODE`: A string variable holding the current mode (likely 'dev' or 'prod').
- `__root__`: A `Path` object representing the root directory of the project.
- `settings`: A dictionary object containing project configuration data loaded from `settings.json`.
- `doc_str`: A string object containing the project's documentation (content from `README.MD`).
- `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`: String variables holding various project-related data, obtained from the `settings` dictionary or default values if `settings` is missing or specific keys aren't found.


**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

- **Error Handling:** While the `try...except` blocks handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, they currently only print an ellipsis. Consider logging the errors for better debugging.
- **Configuration Data Validation:** Consider adding more robust validation to the loaded `settings.json` data. Validate that the keys and their types match your expectations and throw informative exceptions if data is malformed.  This prevents bugs arising from unexpected config format.
- **File Reading Efficiency**:  Using `settings_file.read()` for `README.MD` might become inefficient for very large files. A more sophisticated approach might load the file line by line or use a library optimized for large file processing.



**Relationships:**

- This file relies on the `gs` module (likely a utility module within the `src` package).  This is inferred by the import `from src import gs`.  It likely handles path-related tasks, ensuring consistency with project paths.
- This file will likely be used by other modules within the `endpoints/prestashop/api` package or beyond, to provide access to the project configuration (`settings`), project name, version, and related information.
