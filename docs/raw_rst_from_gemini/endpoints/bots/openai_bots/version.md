""" module: src.endpoints.bots.openai_bots """
"""
This module defines version information for the OpenAI bots.
- `__version__`: The version string for the module.
- `__name__`: The name of the module.  Will be "__main__" when run directly.
- `__doc__`: The module's documentation string.
- `__details__`: Additional details about the OpenAI bots, in this case, their intended use with Discord and Telegram for model training.
- `__annotations__`:  Empty for now, but would contain type hints if present.
- `__author__`: The author of the module.
"""
__name__ = "__main__"  # Correctly set the __name__ for clarity
__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"
__doc__ = __doc__
__details__ = "Discord and Telegram integration for OpenAI chat bots used in model training."
__annotations__ = {}  # Better to explicitly define as empty
__author__ = "hypotez"
```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **`__name__`:**  Crucially, the `__name__` variable is now set correctly to `"__main__"`.  This is vital if you intend to import this module elsewhere.  Otherwise, using `__name__` might cause problems in an import statement.


* **`__doc__`:** The `__doc__` variable is now correctly assigned the docstring of the module.


* **`__details__` Improvement:** The description of `__details__` is improved to clarify its purpose more precisely.


* **`__annotations__`:**  Explicitly setting `__annotations__` to an empty dictionary is a good practice, as it avoids potential errors if the code is meant to use type hints at a later date.


* **Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability and clarity.


* **Correct Documentation:** The docstring now accurately explains the purpose and use of the variables.

This revised code is more robust and follows Python conventions more closely, making it suitable for use in a wider range of contexts.  Critically, it avoids potential issues that might arise if `__name__` is not correctly set. Remember to always document your code for maintainability.
