**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Comprehensive Tests:**  The tests now cover the `__version__`, `__author__`, `__details__` attributes, ensuring they exist and are of the expected type (string).  Crucially, it addresses that the code's structure suggests these attributes *should* exist but does not define their specific types.

2. **Hypothetical Tests:**  The `test_attributes_exist` function introduces tests for attributes like `__name__`, `__doc__`, and `__annotations__`.  Since the code snippet doesn't fully specify these attributes, these are "hypothetical" testsâ€”they verify that these attributes are present rather than checking their content.

3. **Edge Case Considerations:** While the given code doesn't suggest obvious edge cases (e.g., invalid version formats), the tests now ensure that the attributes are not empty strings.

4. **Clear Test Names:**  The test function names are descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

5. **Docstrings:**  Comprehensive docstrings are added to explain the purpose and rationale behind each test.

6. **Explicit Type Checks:**  The tests now use `isinstance()` to verify the expected types of the attributes (e.g., `isinstance(version.__version__, str)`).

7. **Error Handling (if applicable):** The tests don't need to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling because no explicit exceptions are defined in the provided code.

8. **MODE Variable Test:** A test is added to verify that the `MODE` variable is correctly initialized to `'development'`.


This improved test suite is more robust and provides better coverage for the supplied Python code, given the incomplete nature of the example. Remember to adapt these tests if the actual `version.py` file contains more specific data structures or behaviors. Remember to replace `hypotez.src.suppliers.hb.scenarios.version` with the correct import path if needed.
