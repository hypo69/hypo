```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Structure:** The tests are now organized into functions for each key functionality (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).  This makes the tests easier to read and maintain.

2. **Mocking for File Operations:** The crucial improvements are the mocking of file operations (`open`). Using `unittest.mock.patch` and `mock_open` is essential to prevent real file interactions during testing. This prevents accidental file creation or modification in the test environment. This fixes the issue of not handling `gs` correctly in the tests.

3. **Fixtures for Settings and README:**  Fixtures `mock_settings` and `mock_readme` provide controlled, reusable data for the tests related to reading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  These were previously missing, making the tests less robust.

4. **Testing Exceptions (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):** Added tests for `test_settings_file_read` and `test_readme_file_read` to ensure the code handles these potential exceptions gracefully.

5. **`pytest.raises` (optional, but good practice):** While I've included mocking instead of `pytest.raises` for exception handling, it's a good idea to include `pytest.raises` tests for exceptions, like this:

```python
# Example (using mock_open for a more robust solution)
def test_file_not_found():
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as f:
            # ...
```

6. **Complete Test Coverage (Important):** The provided tests now cover more aspects of the code: 
   - Correct file location identification
   - Correct handling of cases where the marker files aren't found.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the project directory.


This revised solution addresses the issues in the previous response and provides a more robust and complete set of tests. Remember to adapt the test directory paths if your project structure differs. Remember to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
