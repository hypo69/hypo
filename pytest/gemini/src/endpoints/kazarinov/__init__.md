```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov import MODE
from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.kazarinov_bot import KazarinovTelegramBot


# Tests for the MODE constant
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks the value of the MODE constant."""
    assert MODE == 'dev', f"Expected 'dev', but got '{MODE}'"


# Tests for the KazarinovTelegramBot class, if present.
# Note: Since the provided code only imports the class, but
# does not define any functions, we can't test specific methods.
# If the class has methods or properties, test those here.


#Example, assuming a method exists:
# def test_kazarinov_bot_initialization():
#     """Tests if the bot can be initialized."""
#     bot = KazarinovTelegramBot()
#     assert bot is not None, "Bot initialization failed"
#
#
# def test_kazarinov_bot_method_call():
#     """Test the behavior of a method in the bot class."""
#     bot = KazarinovTelegramBot()
#     # Replace with an appropriate method and expected return value
#     result = bot.process_message("test_message")
#     assert result == "expected_response", "Method call returned incorrect result"

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Corrected import statements to target the specific module and class if they are present.

2. **MODE Constant Test:**  Added a test specifically for the `MODE` constant, verifying its expected value.  This is crucial since it is a global variable.

3. **Placeholder for KazarinovTelegramBot Tests:** The example shows a place to add tests assuming the class has methods or properties.  Critically, the `test_kazarinov_bot_initialization` and `test_kazarinov_bot_method_call` are now *placeholders*.  You need to:
   - **Replace the placeholder comments** with actual test cases for the methods (`process_message`, etc) of `KazarinovTelegramBot` if they exist.  
   - **Define the actual method** and add  the `assert` statements for specific outputs in these tests.   


4. **Import from .kazarinov_bot:**  The code now correctly imports from the `kazarinov_bot` module.

5. **Error Handling:**  Error handling with `pytest.raises` isn't necessary in this particular case because no functions are being called or tested. If your code had functions that could raise exceptions, add appropriate `pytest.raises` tests to verify the exception handling.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_kazarinov.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_kazarinov.py`


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Missing Code:** If the `kazarinov_bot.py` file (or any other necessary modules) is missing, the tests won't run.
*   **Class Methods:**  The provided `KazarinovTelegramBot` likely has methods or properties you will need to test.  This example shows placeholders for how you'd test those.
*   **Data:** If the functions need input data (e.g., `data` for `kazarinov_bot` methods or variables), you'll need to write fixtures to provide them in an organized way. Add tests to cover all possible input scenarios (valid, invalid, and edge cases).


Remember to replace the placeholder comments and add the appropriate tests based on the actual methods in `KazarinovTelegramBot` if the file exists with methods in the class. The example tests demonStarte the structure and logic of writing `pytest` tests for functions and classes.
