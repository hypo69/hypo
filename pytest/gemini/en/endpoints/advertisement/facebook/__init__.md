```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly describe the test's purpose (e.g., `test_facebook_object_creation`).

2. **`get_event_url` Test Cases:** Added tests for the `get_event_url` function.  Crucially, a test for `get_event_url` returning `None` is included, handling the case where no URL is available. This is a common edge case.  The previous test assumed a return value of something. The current test is more robust.

3. **Mocking:** Added a `test_get_event_url_no_url_returns_none` test that uses a mock function (using a `mock` library if you have one). This is better than trying to test something that directly depends on another component (which is hard to control).
   - This example assumes that the `get_event_url` function is called from inside a real class, `FacebookPromoter`.

4. **Missing Internal Function Tests:** The code emphasizes that you *must* add tests for the internal functions within `Facebook`, `FacebookFields`, and `FacebookPromoter`.  I've included a placeholder example for this. You need to analyze the code of these classes and write tests that cover their functionality.  This is where the majority of the testing effort will be focused.

5. **Missing Data/Dependencies:** The tests need appropriate "fixtures" or data to test the other functions correctly. For example, `test_get_event_url` needs to know the method `get_event_url` will use for generating the URL.

**How to use the mock:**
You'd typically use the `mock` library for mocking `get_event_url` in a real-world test.  If you don't have `mock`, or if it's not necessary for your current testing needs, you can use a placeholder implementation as shown in `test_get_event_url_no_url_returns_none`.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze `Facebook`, `FacebookFields`, `FacebookPromoter`:**  Understand the methods/functions inside these classes and write specific tests covering their functionality.
* **Data:** Identify the data needed for testing the internal functions, and create fixtures (using `pytest.fixture`) that provide this data.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test valid input, invalid input, edge cases, and exceptions for all methods.


```python
# Example using a mock if you have one
# import unittest.mock as mock 
# # ... other tests

# def test_get_event_url_no_url():
#     with mock.patch.object(FacebookPromoter, 'get_event_url', return_value=None):
#         assert get_event_url() is None

``` Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already (`pip install pytest`). You will likely need to install other libraries too if you are mocking internal functions (using the mock library).
