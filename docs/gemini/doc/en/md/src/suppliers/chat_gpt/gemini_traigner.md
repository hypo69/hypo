# Gemini Traigner

## Overview

This module contains settings and configurations for Gemini training, likely part of a larger system for interacting with the Gemini language model. The `MODE` variable defines the current operating mode.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable defining the operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  This variable is likely used to control different configurations and behaviors of the training process.

**Value**: `'dev'`


## Usage

The code currently primarily defines the `MODE` variable.  Further functions and classes, not present in the current code snippet, would be needed for actual Gemini training functionality.
