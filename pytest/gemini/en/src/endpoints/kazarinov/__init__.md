**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** The tests now correctly import the `MODE` and `KazarinovTelegramBot` from the specified file.  Critically, it imports the `KazarinovTelegramBot` class, which is essential for testing it.


2. **Testing `KazarinovTelegramBot`:**  The previous tests were missing.  The provided example tests for the class instantiation and assumes that the class has a `send_message` method (you should adapt these tests to the actual methods of your `KazarinovTelegramBot` class).


3. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):** Added `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions (e.g., if `KazarinovTelegramBot`'s constructor or methods might raise exceptions for incorrect input).


4. **Mocking (`mocker`):**  Crucial for testing parts of your code that rely on external dependencies. The `mocker` fixture allows you to simulate the behavior of these external parts.


5. **Missing Code:** The tests now cover the initialization and an example of how to test a method call. The important part is replacing the placeholders like `"test message"` and `"some_external_module"` with your actual code details.



**How to use this template:**

* **Replace placeholders:**  Change `"some_external_module"`, `"some_function"`, `"some_attribute"`, `"some_method"`, and `"test message"` with the actual names in your `kazarinov_bot.py` file.  Crucially, update the test logic that interacts with external modules and classes with your own logic.

* **Add more tests:**  Create more test functions to cover more scenarios of your `KazarinovTelegramBot` class (e.g., what happens with empty messages, unusual characters, different types of inputs, etc.).

* **Run the tests:**  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_kazarinov.py`) in the same directory as your `kazarinov.py` file and run `pytest test_kazarinov.py`.


This revised solution is much more robust and provides a solid template for writing comprehensive `pytest` tests for your code, focusing on the actual logic contained within the provided file, including edge cases and error handling. Remember to adapt these tests to the specific methods and attributes in your code.
