**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Actual Code to Test:** The provided code snippet is just an import statement.  There are no functions or classes to test.  The example tests are *hypothetical* and would need to be adapted to match the actual functions and classes from the full `hypotez` project.

2. **Missing Context:**  Without the actual implementations of `PrestaShop`, `PrestaCategory`, etc., you cannot create meaningful test cases.

3. **Appropriate Tests:** Real tests would involve:
   - **Method Testing:** If `PrestaShop` has a method like `get_products()`, you would test its return types, handling of different parameters, edge cases (empty lists, invalid input), and potential exceptions.
   - **Attribute Testing:** Test if the attributes of the objects are set correctly (e.g., `shop.name`, `shop.products`).
   - **Error Handling:** Check that your classes handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid data) gracefully.

4. **Fixtures:** Fixtures are useful if your tests need to create complex setup or if you need to test with common data.  If data is needed to instantiate PrestaShop, etc.,  a fixture could be added to provide that data for the tests.

5. **pytest.raises:** If the code could raise exceptions, use `pytest.raises` to verify the correct exception type and message.

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with specific assertions and checks related to the actual implementations in `hypotez/src/endpoints`. Provide the full relevant code for more comprehensive test cases.
