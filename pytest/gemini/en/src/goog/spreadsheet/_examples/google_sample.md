**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `print` function for testing the output. This is crucial for isolating the test from external dependencies like the actual Google Sheets API.  More importantly, it mocks the `build()` function, and the `values().get()` call to return sample data or simulate errors, making the tests independent of an actual Google account.

2. **Error Handling:** The `test_main_http_error` test now correctly uses `pytest.raises` to verify that the `HttpError` is caught and handled.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and informative.

4. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Used `pytest.tmpdir` to create a temporary directory for the mock credential file. This ensures that mock files don't interfere with other tests or persist after the test suite runs. This is crucial for ensuring that tests are clean.


5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests cover valid inputs (including a successful API call with expected output) , no data cases, error handling, and  the important edge case where the credential file might not be found.

6. **Dummy Credentials:** Uses a `DUMMY_CREDENTIALS` string to create mock credentials in a way that doesn't rely on an external file; this makes the tests self-contained and ensures consistent testing conditions.

7. **Fixture for Mock Service:** The `mock_service` fixture makes testing the `main()` function more organized and reusable; it's crucial for avoiding any potential side effects between tests.



**How to Run:**

1.  **Install necessary packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```
2.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/_examples/test_google_sample.py
    ```

Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/_examples/test_google_sample.py"` with the correct path to your test file if it's not in the `hypotez` directory. This improved structure significantly enhances the reliability and maintainability of your tests. Remember to replace `"token.json"` with your mock credentials file and  `'credentials.json'` with the actual credentials file if necessary.
