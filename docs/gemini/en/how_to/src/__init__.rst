How to use the hypotez/src/__init__.py module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module, `hypotez/src/__init__.py`, serves as the root of the project. It provides an overview of the project's modules, outlining their functionalities and roles.  It primarily sets a `MODE` variable and imports the `gs` object from the `credentials.py` module.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The `MODE` variable is assigned the string value `'dev'`.
2. The `gs` object is imported from the `hypotez/src/credentials.py` module.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No usage example provided within the module.  This module is typically used as an import point for other modules within the project.

    # Example showing how to use the `gs` object (assuming credentials are defined in credentials.py):
    # from hypotez.src import gs
    # print(gs)  # Accessing the gs object, which is assumed to hold Google Services account credentials.
