Module: src.ai.openai._examples.version.py

This module defines version information for the _examples folder within the OpenAI
submodule.

Variables:
    __version__:
        The version string for this module.
    __name__:
        The name of the module.  Will be "__main__" if run directly.
    __doc__:
        The module docstring.
    __details__:
        Additional details about the module or version.
    __annotations__:
        Type annotations for variables and functions (likely empty).
    __author__:
        The author(s) of the module.
"""

__name__: str
__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"
__doc__ = """Version information for the _examples folder in the OpenAI submodule."""
__details__ = "Details about version for the module or class."
__annotations__ = {}  # Explicitly defining an empty dictionary for clarity

__author__ = 'hypotez '
```

**Explanation of Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring is significantly improved.  It now clearly explains the purpose of the module, the roles of the variables, and provides a more informative overview.  Importantly, it clarifies that `__annotations__` is likely empty.

* **Type Hinting:**  While the original code had type hints in the form of variable assignments (e.g., `__name__: str`), it was unclear if those were intended and whether they were fully implemented. The improved code now explicitly defines `__annotations__` as an empty dictionary, demonstrating good practice and clarifying the absence of any type annotations.

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted to be more readable and maintainable with clear comments and structured variables.

* **Meaningful Docstrings:**  The docstrings are now more informative and follow Python best practices.

* **Correct Usage of `__name__`:** The `__name__` variable is correctly used and documented. Its value will reflect the module's name or become `__main__` if the file is executed directly.


**How to use this module:**

You'd likely import this module to get the version number or other metadata, for example:

```python
import hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version.__version__)
print(hypotez.src.ai.openai._examples.version.__details__)
```

This improved example provides a much better understanding and use case for the provided `version.py` file.  Remember to adjust the import path if your project structure is different. Remember the correct path to the module should be resolved at runtime.
