- Removed redundant docstrings and comments that were not RST formatted.
- Removed unnecessary `"""` blocks.
- Removed empty lines.
- Updated `MODE` comment to be RST formatted and explain the variable.
- Removed redundant comments.
- Corrected the use of `.. module::` syntax in RST documentation.
- Import statements were corrected.  (No changes were necessary, as no errors were present.)
