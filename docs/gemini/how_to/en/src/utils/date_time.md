# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/utils/date_time.py`

This module provides functions for checking if the current time falls within a specified interval, optionally with a timeout.  It's useful for scheduling tasks or operations that should only run during particular hours.


## Functions

### `interval(self, start: time = time(23, 0), end: time = time(6, 0)) -> bool`

This function checks if the current time is within a given time interval.

* **Parameters:**
    * `start` (time): The start time of the interval (default: 23:00).
    * `end` (time): The end time of the interval (default: 06:00).
* **Return Value:**
    * `bool`: `True` if the current time is within the interval, `False` otherwise.

* **Important Considerations:**
    * The interval can span midnight (e.g., 23:00 to 06:00).
    * The code correctly handles intervals that *do not* span midnight, as well.


### `interval_with_timeout(self, timeout: int = 5, start: time = time(23, 0), end: time = time(6, 0)) -> bool`

This function checks if the current time is within a given time interval, waiting for the check to complete with a timeout.

* **Parameters:**
    * `timeout` (int): The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the interval check to complete. Default is 5 seconds.
    * `start` (time): The start time of the interval (default: 23:00).
    * `end` (time): The end time of the interval (default: 06:00).

* **Return Value:**
    * `bool`: `True` if the current time is within the interval and the check completes successfully *within* the timeout period. `False` if the check doesn't complete within the timeout or the current time is *outside* the interval.


* **How it Works:**
    * It creates a separate thread to perform the `interval` check.
    * It waits for the thread to complete or for the timeout period to elapse.
    * If the timeout occurs, it prints a message and returns `False`.


### `get_input(self)`

This function prompts the user for input.  This function is not directly exposed; it's used internally by the `input_with_timeout` function.


### `input_with_timeout(self, timeout: int = 5) -> str | None`

This function waits for user input with a timeout.

* **Parameters:**
    * `timeout` (int): The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for input. Default is 5 seconds.
* **Return Value:**
    * `str`: The user's input, if received within the timeout.
    * `None`: If the timeout occurs before any input is received.

* **How it works:**
    * It creates a separate thread to handle input from the user (using the `get_input` function).
    * It waits for the input thread to complete or for the timeout to expire.
    * If the timeout expires, it prints a message and returns `None`.


## Example Usage (in `if __name__ == '__main__':`)

The provided example demonstrates how to use `interval_with_timeout`. It checks if the current time is within the default interval (23:00-06:00) with a 5-second timeout.


## Important Considerations

* **Error Handling:** The `interval_with_timeout` function handles potential timeouts gracefully, printing a message and returning `False` when a timeout occurs.
* **Thread Safety:** The use of threads is crucial for allowing other tasks to continue while waiting for potentially time-consuming input or interval checks.
* **Thread Joining:** Explicitly joining the thread (`thread.join()`) is essential to prevent the program from continuing before the thread has completed or timed out. This ensures the thread is properly closed after the check.
