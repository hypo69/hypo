When the program is started via main(), the following sequence of execution occurs:
@code
s = Supplier('aliexpress')


s.run()


s.run('file1')


scenario_files = ['file1', ...]
s.run(scenario_files)


scenario1 = {'key': 'value'}
s.run(scenario1)


list_of_scenarios = [scenario1, ...]
s.run(list_of_scenarios)

**Example:**

* **`run('file1')`**: The `Supplier` object calls `run_scenario_file` function, passing `file1` as an argument. This triggers processing of the scenario file content.

* **`run(['file1', 'file2'])`**: Calls `run_scenario_files`, which iterates over the list of files and calls `run_scenario_file` for each one.

* **`run({'scenario1': {...}})`**: Calls `run_scenarios`, which processes the provided scenario dictionary (example provided in the docstring).  The dictionary likely contains instructions to execute.

**<explanation>**

* **Imports:** The `from .executor import ...` line imports several functions from a module named `executor`, likely within the same directory (`hypotez/src/scenario`). This suggests a modular design where scenario execution logic is separated from the `scenario` module itself.

* **Variables:** `MODE = 'dev'` is a global variable probably for setting execution modes (e.g., development, production). This can be useful in configuring the behavior of other parts of the code.

* **Functions (implicit):** The docstring details several functions (`run_scenario`, `run_scenarios`, `run_scenario_file`, etc.) that are imported.  These likely handle different types of scenario inputs (single file, list of files, single dictionary, list of dictionaries), and the subsequent steps involved in processing the scenarios.

* **Classes (implicit):**  The docstring mentions a `Supplier` class.  However, the code snippet *only* imports functions, not class definitions. The `Supplier` class is external to this file (likely defined in a different file in the `hypotez/src` directory or a different subpackage),  and likely contains the `run()` method or a similar function, that are responsible for interacting with the executor functions imported here.  


* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**

    * **Missing `Supplier` class:**  The code assumes a `Supplier` class exists and has a `run()` method.  If `Supplier` isn't correctly defined, this will cause an error.

    * **Error Handling:**  Error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) is missing, making the code less robust. If a scenario file is corrupt, or a network issue occurs during data insertion, the script may crash.  Functions like `run_scenario_file` or `run_scenarios` should include `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors and provide informative error messages.

    * **Data validation:**  The provided example scenario JSON structure is hardcoded in the docstring.  The code should validate the format of the input scenario data.  Error handling for invalid JSON or missing keys should be included to prevent unexpected behavior.


* **Relationship with other parts:** The `executor` module likely contains the core logic for processing the scenarios and performing data insertion (likely into a PrestaShop database).  The `scenario` module acts as an interface or entry point to use that logic, passing parameters to the executor modules and handling different input formats. The `PrestaShop` part of the system handles interacting with the database.

In summary, this code snippet is a high-level interface that allows the program to execute scenarios against a supplier. The bulk of the scenario execution logic is contained in the `executor` module, while this module handles the various input formats and orchestrates the execution flow.  Crucially, the `Supplier` class (defined elsewhere) is the "driver" in this system.
