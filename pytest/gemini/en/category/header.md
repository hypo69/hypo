**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.fixture` for mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function and return pre-defined JSON data. This is crucial for isolating the tests from the actual file system and ensuring they don't affect each other. This is critical for preventing accidental side effects.
* **`mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_md`:** Fixtures are created to provide a controlled and consistent way to return JSON and README content.
* **`tmp_path` fixture from `pytest`:** This is used for creating temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up after the tests, avoiding conflicts and ensuring proper isolation.
* **`parametrize` for exception handling:**  The test for file handling now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test multiple scenarios with different filenames and expected exceptions.
* **Clearer assertions:** Assertions now explicitly check for the expected values, making the tests more robust and readable.
* **Comprehensive Edge Case Tests:** Now includes more comprehensive tests for cases like a marker file in the parent directory, no marker files present, and marker files not existing.
* **Correct Handling of `sys.path`:**  Crucial fixes to properly handle inserting the root directory into `sys.path` while maintaining test isolation.
* **Comprehensive exception handling:** The original code lacked a robust way to test exception handling (e.g., `FileNotFoundError` when `settings.json` is not found). These tests ensure that the code correctly handles the expected errors when the files are missing or in a different format.
* **Improved test organization:** Tests are grouped more logically.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides much more thorough testing of the `get_project_root` function, addressing potential issues and improving the overall test suite. Remember to adjust the test cases further based on specific requirements.

```python
from io import StringIO #needed for mock_settings_json
import sys #needed for test_get_project_root_no_marker_files

```
