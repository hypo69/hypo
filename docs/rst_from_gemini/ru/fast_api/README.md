```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The previous code was empty.  This updated README provides a basic structure for a Fast API project.  It describes the typical directory structure, and importantly, adds placeholders for crucial sections a user would need to understand to get started.

**Crucially, it now includes:**

* **Project Description:** A brief overview of the application's purpose.
* **Project Structure:** Explains the directory layout (very important for understanding how to navigate and work with the project).  This is essential.
* **Getting Started:** A placeholder section to explain the next steps (installation, running the application, etc.). You should replace this placeholder with real instructions.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Fill in the Placeholders:**  Complete the `Getting Started` section with details about running the application, installing dependencies, and any relevant configuration.  If using Docker, describe how to build and run the container.
2. **Add More Details:**  If applicable, include information about:
    * API endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
    * Data models (e.g., `User`, `Product` Pydantic models).
    * Authentication or authorization methods used.
    * Usage examples for the API.


Remember to update the `README.md` file with the specific details of your Fast API project to make it useful.
