How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file (`hypotez/src/webdriver/__init__.py`) appears to be an initialization file for a webdriver library.  It defines a constant `MODE` and imports various webdriver-related classes.  Critically, it *does not* currently contain any executable functions; rather, it only prepares the namespace for such functions.  Import statements for specific webdriver implementations (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) are commented out, indicating that the library is likely designed to be easily extensible by adding new drivers in the future.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file sets a variable `MODE` to the string `'dev'`.  This variable likely controls runtime configurations or behaviors (e.g., logging levels, data handling).

2. The file imports various driver classes.  Import statements are commented out at the moment, making the actual usage of the drivers conditional on uncommented imports.  

3.  The Python interpreter will process the file, creating the namespace `webdriver`. The presence of commented-out import statements strongly suggests that these drivers (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, etc.) are found in other files or modules that would be imported into this file (`webdriver.__init__.py`) when required.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This example assumes that the necessary driver classes (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) are implemented and uncommented imports.

    from hypotez.src.webdriver import Chrome

    # Create a Chrome webdriver object
    driver = Chrome()

    # Perform actions with the driver (e.g., open a webpage)
    # ...
    
    # (Crucial) Close the driver properly to release resources
    driver.quit()
