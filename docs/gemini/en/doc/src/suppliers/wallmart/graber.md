# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/wallmart/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class, a subclass of `Grbr` (likely from a parent module), specifically designed for collecting product data from the `wallmart.com` website.  The class leverages asynchronous functions (`async def`) to handle web scraping operations.  It provides a framework for extracting various product fields, allowing for custom data handling within individual functions if necessary.  The module also includes the ability to close pop-up windows before data extraction.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class handles the process of grabbing product fields from the `wallmart.com` website. It inherits from the `Grbr` class, likely a base class for web scraping functionality.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` object.  It sets the `supplier_prefix` to 'wallmart' and calls the parent class constructor (`super().__init__`). Crucial for setting up necessary data contexts.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): Instance of the web driver, used for interacting with the browser.

#### `grab_page`

**Description**: An asynchronous function for fetching product information from the target URL.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The driver instance needed for interaction with the browser.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: An object containing the collected product fields.

**Raises**:  (If relevant exception handling is present in the code)
- `ExecuteLocatorException`: Raised if there's an error during execution of the locator.


## Functions

(None explicitly defined in this module, but individual functions for data extraction are defined within the `Graber` class)


## Data Extraction Functions (Methods of the `Graber` class)


These methods handle specific data points from the product page.


(List all relevant methods here.  This section would be significantly expanded by adding the actual method signatures from the Python code.  For example, if you have an `async def id_product(self, id_product: str) -> dict` you would document it like this):


#### `id_product`

**Description**: Retrieves the `id_product` value from the web page.

**Parameters**:

- `id_product` (str): The `id_product` value to potentially pass.

**Returns**:

- `dict`: Contains extracted data related to the `id_product` field.


(Add similar documentation for each data extraction method defined within the `Graber` class, describing parameters, returns, and potential exceptions.)


## Module-Level Variables

(Document any module-level variables, like `MODE`.)

#### `MODE`

**Description**:  Represents the current operating mode of the module (likely 'dev' in this case).


## Notes

- The `@close_pop_up` decorator is commented out.  To use it, uncomment the relevant code.
- The code includes extensive data extraction methods, each needing detailed documentation within this section.
- The code relies on external classes and modules (`Grbr`, `Context`, `Driver`, etc.), which should also be documented in their respective modules.  Incomplete documentation for the parent class is a key missing element here.
