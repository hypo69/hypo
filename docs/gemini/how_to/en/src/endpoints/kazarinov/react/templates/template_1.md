This HTML template (`template_1.html`) is designed for displaying product listings.  It utilizes Jinja2 templating language, which allows dynamic content insertion.  Here's a usage guide:

**1. Purpose and Structure:**

The template displays a list of products, including title, image, description, and a calculated total price. It uses Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.

**2. Variables and Context:**

The template expects data to be passed to it, typically via a Python web framework (like Flask or Django).  The following variables are crucial:

* **`language`**: The language code (e.g., "en", "ru").
* **`title`**: The overall title of the product page.
* **`description`**: A brief description of the product listing.
* **`products`**: A list of dictionaries, each representing a single product.  Crucially, each product dictionary must have the following keys:
    * `product_title`: The title of the product.
    * `image_local_saved_path`: The local file path to the image.  **Important:** This path should be correctly constructed to match your file system, considering potential directory structure.
    * `product_description`: The product's description.
* **`price`**: The total price of all products.
* **`currency`**: The currency symbol (e.g., "$", "â‚¬").


**3. Template Tags (Jinja2):**

* **`{{ ... }}`**: Used for variables.  Example: `{{ title }}`, `{{ price }}`.
* **`{% ... %}`**: Used for control flow and other directives.
* **`{% for product in products %}`**: Iterates through the `products` list, rendering a `product-card` for each.  Inside this loop, `product` refers to each individual dictionary in the list.
* **Example of how to access data in `for` loop:**
```html
<img src="{{ product.image_local_saved_path }}" ... />
<h3>{{ product.product_title }}</h3>
```

**4. Styling:**

* The template uses Bootstrap classes (`container`, `row`, `col-md-6`, `img-fluid`) for layout and responsiveness.
* Custom CSS is included to style the product cards, images, pricing, and the overall layout.  The dark color scheme (`#0d1117`) is noticeable.

**5.  Critical Considerations:**

* **File Paths (`image_local_saved_path`):**  **Thoroughly verify** that the `image_local_saved_path` values are correctly constructed and point to valid images in your file system.  Incorrect paths will lead to broken images.  Use absolute paths if possible.
* **Error Handling:**  The template doesn't include error handling.  In your Python backend (Flask, Django, etc.), include checks for missing or invalid data.  For example, if `products` is empty, display an appropriate message.
* **Dynamic Content:** Ensure that the `price`, `currency`, `products`, `title`, and `description` are populated correctly and accurately reflect the data you want to display.
* **Security:** Sanitize user-provided data (if applicable) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.


**6. Example Usage (Conceptual - Python Flask):**

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# ... (Your app setup) ...

@app.route('/products')
def products():
    # Load products from database or other data source
    products = [
        {'product_title': 'Product A', 'image_local_saved_path': 'path/to/imageA.jpg', 'product_description': 'Description A'},
        {'product_title': 'Product B', 'image_local_saved_path': 'path/to/imageB.jpg', 'product_description': 'Description B'}
    ]

    # Calculate price and currency here
    price = 100
    currency = '$'

    return render_template('template_1.html', products=products, price=price, currency=currency, title='Product Catalog', description='List of products', language='en')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

This is a skeletal example.  Adapt the Python code to fetch the actual product data from your database or data source.  The critical part is how you load the `products` list.  This example is for illustrating how to integrate the template using context. Remember to install the necessary Python libraries (if any).
