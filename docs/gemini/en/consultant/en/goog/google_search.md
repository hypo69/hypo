**Received Code**



**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

- Added necessary imports: `from lxml import html`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`, and `from src.logger import logger`.
- Added error handling using `try...except` blocks and `logger.error` for improved robustness. This is crucial to prevent crashes and log errors effectively.
- Rewrote all comments and docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format, following Sphinx conventions.  This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
- Adjusted function, variable, and import names to align with the general coding style in hypotez.
- Improved error handling.  Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors in `_get_estimated_results` and other functions, logging them with `logger.error`. This ensures the parser doesn't crash on malformed HTML.
