How to use the `hypotez/src/templates/header.py` file
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python script (`header.py`) defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It searches upwards from the current file's location for directories containing specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`).  If found, it sets the `__root__` variable to that directory and adds it to the Python path (`sys.path`). This is useful for importing modules from the project's source code. It also initializes a project root path variable `__root__`.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The script initializes a variable `current_path` to the directory containing the current Python file (`header.py`).
2. It iterates through the current directory and its parent directories.
3. For each parent directory, it checks if any of the specified marker files (`marker_files`) exist within that directory.
4. If any marker file is found, `__root__` is updated to the parent directory and the loop breaks.
5. If `__root__` is not already in `sys.path`, it's added to the front of the path list.
6. The function returns the determined `__root__` path.
7. The script then calls `set_project_root()` to find the project's root directory.
8. The result (`__root__`) is stored as the `__root__` variable, which is a `pathlib.Path` object.
9. The script imports the `gs` module from the `src` package, using the determined root path.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # In another Python file (e.g., main.py)
    from hypotez.src.templates.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage to set the project root path
    root_path = set_project_root()

    # Verify the path (optional)
    print(f"Project root path: {root_path}")

    # Now you can import modules from the src package, knowing the project root:
    from src import gs
    result = gs.some_function()
    print(result)
