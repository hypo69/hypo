**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No `input_code` functions:** The provided `input_code` is only import statements and docstrings.  There are no functions to test.  The tests above check for the existence of the classes.
2. **Hypothetical Tests:** The example `test_presta_shop_method_example` is purely hypothetical. You **must** replace it with tests for actual methods from the classes (e.g., `PrestaShop.get_products()`, etc.) if such methods exist in your actual code.  Look for functions and methods that return values. 
3. **Assertions:** The hypothetical test demonStartes how you would add assertions. The assertions should verify the *correctness* of the method's behavior (e.g., the return type, the presence of specific values).
4. **Error Handling:** If the code you want to test has `try...except` blocks, your tests should include scenarios to verify these exception handlers are working correctly.
5. **Data:** If a function takes data as input, provide various test data types, including valid, invalid, and edge case scenarios.  For example, if a function expects an integer, try integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.
6. **Fixtures:** The tests above don't need fixtures because the tests are focused on the existence of the classes.  If the actual code has functions that take parameters, you would create fixtures to provide those parameters in your tests.


**How to Use and Adapt:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with the actual names of the classes and functions from your `endpoints` module.  If functions are present, the test cases need to be adjusted to verify them properly.

2. **Add Assertions:** Write assertions to verify the expected behavior of the function or class.

3. **Run Tests:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_endpoints.py`) in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/endpoints/__init__.py` file and run `pytest test_endpoints.py` from your terminal.

This revised answer provides a more accurate and realistic example of writing `pytest` tests for your provided code. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual functionality of the code within the `endpoints` module.
