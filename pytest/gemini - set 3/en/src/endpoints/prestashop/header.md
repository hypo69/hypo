**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_settings_json` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary files for testing.  Crucially, `temp_project_structure` is used to create a proper directory structure, mocking the expected project layout.
* **Robust Testing:** The tests now cover more scenarios, including edge cases (no marker files, marker in parent, invalid marker files).
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive about what is being checked.
* **`temp_project_structure` Fixture:** This is a vital improvement.  It allows you to create a temporary directory structure resembling a project, containing the necessary files (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, .git, settings.json, README.MD). This way, your tests are no longer reliant on your actual project directory structure, making them more reliable.  The `tmp_path` fixture from pytest is used to make this temporary directory.
* **`test_set_project_root_adds_to_sys_path`:** This crucial test verifies that the function correctly inserts the project root into `sys.path`, which is an essential behavior of the function.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks in the original code are preserved, making tests more robust against potential errors in the code under test.


**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution provides more comprehensive and reliable tests that cover a wider range of inputs and scenarios, ensuring the correctness and robustness of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` with the actual file path if it's different. Also, to use this code, you'll need to have a `hypotez` directory with the necessary subdirectories.
