.. module: src.suppliers.ivory
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect product field values from `ivory.co.il`.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    Override these functions in this class for non-standard processing.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, pass a value
    to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines
    and redefine its behavior.

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `grab_page` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch and log any exceptions that might occur during the data collection process. This is crucial for robustness.  It returns `None` if an error happens to signal that the function failed.
* **Clearer Function Structure:** The `fetch_all_data` function is added to centralize the calls to individual data retrieval methods, making the code more organized and readable.
* **Decorator Application:** The `apply_decorator` function is introduced. It checks for the presence of `Context.locator_for_decorator`. If set, it will run the appropriate decorator on the webdriver.  Crucially, it includes error handling for the decorator. This is now consistent with other error handling.
* **`id_product` Parameter:** The `grab_page` function now accepts `id_product` as an argument and passes it to the `fetch_all_data` function.  This allows the calling code to specify which product to fetch.

* **`fetch_all_data` and Individual Functions:** The `fetch_all_data` function is added to structure the data fetching logic. Each individual function call now is enclosed within the try-except block to catch potential errors within the individual methods (e.g., `self.id_product`).

**How to Use:**

```python
# Example usage (assuming you have a Driver instance)
async def main():
    driver = await Driver.create()  # Initialize your driver
    graber = Graber(driver)

    # Set the locator for the decorator if needed (in your context):
    Context.locator_for_decorator = ...

    try:
        result = await graber.grab_page(driver, id_product='1234')  # Example id
        if result:
            # Process the result
            print(result)
        else:
            print("Error occurred while grabbing product data.")
    finally:
        await driver.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

This revised code is significantly more robust and maintainable, as it follows best practices for error handling in asynchronous code and clearly separates the different responsibilities. Remember to replace the `...` placeholders with your actual implementation for individual functions.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with your actual implementation for individual field extraction.  Also, ensure the `id_product` parameter is used correctly throughout your code to fetch the data for the correct product.


This example assumes you have a `Driver` class that handles webdriver interactions (you'll need to adapt this example to your specific `Driver` class).
