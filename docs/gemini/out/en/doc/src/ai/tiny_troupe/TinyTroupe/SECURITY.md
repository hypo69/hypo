## Overview

This document outlines Microsoft's security policy for reporting vulnerabilities found in GitHub repositories.  It provides instructions for reporting security issues and the information required to assist in their investigation.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report) or via email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). Encryption using our PGP key is recommended.  Download the PGP key from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

Response time is typically within 24 hours.  Follow-up is recommended if no response is received. Further information is available at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

**Required Information:**

To expedite the handling of your report, please provide the following information:

* **Type of Issue:** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* **Affected File Paths:** (Full paths of source files related to the issue)
* **Source Code Location:** (Tag/branch/commit or direct URL of the affected source code)
* **Special Configuration:** (Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue)
* **Reproduction Steps:** (Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue)
* **Proof-of-Concept/Exploit Code:** (If possible)
* **Impact:** (How an attacker might exploit the issue)

Complete reports significantly contribute to higher bounty rewards, particularly within the context of a bug bounty program.  Detailed information is available on the [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page.
