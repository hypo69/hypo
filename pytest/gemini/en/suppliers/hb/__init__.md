**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Corrected import statement to `from hypotez.src.suppliers.hb import Graber`.  Crucially, it assumes the file structure matches the import path.

2. **Existence Checks:**  Includes tests to ensure the `Graber` class and `MODE` attribute exist. This prevents cryptic errors if the module is not properly structured or if the class/attribute is missing.

3. **Type Checking (Example):**  Added a check to ensure `MODE` is a string, but adapt to your expected type.

4. **Missing Methods:** The `test_graber_fetch_data_valid_input` is now a *skipped* test if `fetch_data` doesn't exist. This prevents an error if the method doesn't exist in the code.

5. **Error Handling (Example):** The `test_graber_fetch_data_valid_input` now uses a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions raised by `Graber.fetch_data`.  This is crucial for robust testing.


6. **Edge Case Example:** The `test_graber_attribute_none` shows how to test for `None` attributes (important for handling missing data).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace `"valid_data"` and the assertions in `test_graber_fetch_data_valid_input` with actual valid data and expected outputs based on the functionality of the `fetch_data` method.
* **Add More Tests:**  Create similar tests for other methods, attributes, or possible exception scenarios present in your `Graber` class.
* **Use Fixtures:** If the `Graber` class needs any setup, consider creating pytest fixtures to create and configure the object.
* **Real Data:** Replace placeholder data with real or representative data from your expected input.


This improved solution addresses the issues with the previous example and provides more robust and comprehensive tests. Remember to replace the placeholder comments and add tests for all relevant methods and attributes. Remember to adapt the tests to the actual methods and behavior of the `Graber` class.
