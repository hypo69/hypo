**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to each function, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.  Crucially, docstrings describe *what* the functions do, not just the code.  This helps other developers understand how to use the functions.
* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to `get_all_brands_list` to catch potential `ValueError` during the `zip` operation, which can happen if the list elements are not in pairs.  This is *critical* to prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly. The exception message is also informative. Also handles potential empty lists from the executor.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints (e.g., `-> dict`) to specify the return types of the functions.  This improves code readability and maintainability.
* **Clarity and Style:** Improved variable names (e.g., `worlds_dict` instead of `worlds_dic`), and removed redundant comments.  This makes the code easier to read and understand.
* **Consistency:** The `MODE` variable is now placed consistently at the top of the module, outside of any function.
* **`get_product` stub:** Created a stub for the `get_product` function, showing how a docstring for an incomplete function should look.  You'll need to replace the `raise NotImplementedError` with the actual logic to extract data from the product page.
* **Return Values:** More explicit return values now are more informative.

**How to use this improved code:**

```python
# Example usage (replace with your actual locators)
try:
    worlds_data = get_worlds()
    print(worlds_data)

    brands_data = get_all_brands_list()
    print(brands_data)
    
    # ...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Remember to install the necessary libraries (`selenium` for `webdriver`) if you haven't already. This revised code is much more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It's also more likely to run without unexpected errors, a critical aspect of production code.  Crucially, it also follows best practices for documenting and structuring Python code.
