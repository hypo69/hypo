# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/grandadvance/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for grabbing product fields from the Grandadvance supplier. It utilizes a `Driver` instance for interacting with the web page and the `ProductFields` dataclass for structured data storage.  The module also includes decorators, async functions, and global configuration handling.

## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**: This class is responsible for fetching product details from the Grandadvance supplier. It extends the `Grbr` class, likely providing a base structure for suppliers.

**Attributes**:

* `supplier_prefix`: (str): A string prefix identifying the supplier ("grandadvance").

**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` instance with a `Driver` object.  It also sets a crucial global variable `Context.locator` to `None`, likely needed for locator operations.


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: This asynchronous function fetches product fields.  It's designed to be called concurrently, utilizing `async` operations.

**Parameters**:

* `driver` (Driver): The `Driver` instance used for interaction with the web page.

**Returns**:

* `ProductFields`: A `ProductFields` object containing the extracted product data.


#### `local_saved_image(self, value: Any = None)`

**Description**: This function fetches and saves the product's image locally.

**Parameters**:

* `value` (Any, optional): This parameter, if provided, will override the image retrieval process and assign the supplied value to the `ProductFields.local_saved_image` field.

**Returns**:

* `bool`:  Returns `True` if the image is successfully fetched and saved; otherwise it returns `None`.

**Raises**:

* `Exception`: Generic exception if there are issues during image retrieval or saving, which is logged with further details.


## Functions

(No functions defined that are not methods of the `Graber` class.)


## Global Variables


* `MODE`: (str): Likely a configuration variable, set to 'dev'.


## Notes

The code contains significant placeholder comments and logic that needs further elaboration to be properly documented.  The `fetch_all_data` function and many of the other `await self.<method>` calls have placeholder comments and lack detailed documentation, which should be completed in the final documentation to illustrate their behavior and purpose.
