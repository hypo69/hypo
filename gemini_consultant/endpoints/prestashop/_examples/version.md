- `__version__`: This variable holds the version of the module or package.
- `__name__`: Contains the name of the module. If the script is being run directly, the value will be `"__main__"`.
- `__doc__`: The module's documentation string.
- `__details__`: This variable likely contains additional details about the module, but the exact purpose depends on the specific module or package.
- `__annotations__`: Contains type annotations for variables and functions in the module.
- `__author__`: The name(s) of the author(s) of the module.

__name__ = __name__  # Corrected: This is crucial for proper module name setting.


__version__ = "3.12.0.0.0.4"
__doc__ = ""  # Add a docstring for better documentation.
__details__ = "Details about version for module or class"
__annotations__ = {}  # Initialize an empty dictionary
__author__ = 'hypotez '


# Example use (to demonstrate how this module might be used):
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Module name: {__name__}")
    print(f"Version: {__version__}")
    print(f"Details: {__details__}")
    print(f"Author: {__author__}")
```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **`__name__` Assignment:** The original code had `__name__:str`, which is incorrect Python syntax.  The correct way to assign a value to the `__name__` variable is `__name__ = __name__`.  This line is effectively a placeholder, but *crucially*, it now assigns a value of the built-in `__name__` variable to itself. This is essential because the value of `__name__` is determined by Python when the module is imported or run as a script.


2. **`__doc__` Initialization:** The original code left `__doc__` unassigned. I've set it to an empty string (`""`). This is good practice; a docstring is often expected.


3. **`__annotations__` Initialization:** Added `__annotations__ = {}` to initialize this variable as a dictionary, which is the standard way to store type annotations.


4. **Example Usage (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: This crucial block is added.  If you run this Python file directly (not import it into another script), the code inside this `if` block will execute. This demonstrates a way to print out the module's information.  This is a good way to test and display the contents of the module variables, especially during development.

**How to use it:**

Save this code as `version.py` (or the appropriate filename).  Then, in another Python script, you can import and use it:

```python
import hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__version__)
print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__details__)
```

This will output the version and details from the `version.py` module.  Running `version.py` directly will execute the example usage and print the details to the console.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Path:** Make sure that the path to the `version.py` file is correctly referenced in the import statement if you're using this in another script.
* **Module Organization:**  Your project structure appears to have nested modules. You might need to adjust the import paths if your structure changes.
* **`venv/Scripts/python.exe`:** This shebang line (`#! ...`) is related to running the script from the command line. The line is usually not needed if you're importing the module; it's only required for direct execution.

These changes make the module more complete, usable, and more aligned with Python conventions. Remember to replace `hypotez` with your actual package/module name if needed.
