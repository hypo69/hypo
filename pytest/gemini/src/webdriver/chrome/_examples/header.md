**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks `os.getcwd()` and `Path` to avoid relying on the actual file system during testing. This is crucial for unit testing.  Crucially, it also mocks `sys.path.append`.  This is much safer.

2. **`pytest.fixture` for `dir_root_path`:**  A fixture is defined to provide a controlled `dir_root_path` value for each test.

3. **Robust Test Cases:**  Tests now include cases to check if paths are correctly constructed and if `sys.path.append` functions as expected.

4. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are more explicit about what is being tested (e.g., the contents of `dir_root_path`, appending to `sys.path`).

5. **`pytest.mark.parametrize`:** This is used to run the same test with multiple inputs, reducing code duplication, and making tests more comprehensive.

6. **Import error handling:**  Import statements have been added for the modules. This is important if you want to make sure that these imports succeed in your test environment.  A try...except block is used for import error handling.

7. **Test for `print` statement:** A test is added to capture the output from the `print(dir_root)` statement. This ensures that the printing logic is working as intended, though it's important to consider if this is *actually* the desired test behavior given that print statements shouldn't be a crucial part of the test logic.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` in your terminal.

Remember to adapt the test cases and fixtures if your actual code structure differs. If possible, remove the `print` statements from the production code and focus on testing functions and class methods.  Always use mocking for file system interactions, environment variables, and dependencies in your test cases.  This is crucial for proper unit testing.
