### Module Overview: `src.scenario`

The `src.scenario` module is designed to automate interactions with suppliers using scenarios described in JSON files. Its primary task is to adapt the process of extracting and processing product data from supplier websites and synchronize this information with your system's database.

### Main Functions of the Module

1. **Read Scenarios**: The module loads scenarios from JSON files that contain information about various product categories and their URLs on the supplier's website.

2. **Interact with Websites**: Using the URLs specified in the scenarios, the module navigates to the product pages and extracts the necessary data.

3. **Process Data**: The module processes the extracted product data, converts it into the required format, and saves it into your system's database (e.g., PrestaShop).

4. **Logging Execution**: The module keeps a log of scenario executions, recording details of execution and results, which helps track success and identify errors.

### Main Components of the Module

1. **`run_scenario_files(s, scenario_files_list)`**:
   - Takes a list of scenario files and processes them sequentially.
   - Calls `run_scenario_file` to handle each scenario file.

2. **`run_scenario_file(s, scenario_file)`**:
   - Loads scenarios from the specified file and calls `run_scenario` for each scenario in the file.

3. **`run_scenario(s, scenario)`**:
   - Processes an individual scenario.
   - Navigates to the URL specified in the scenario and extracts product data.
   - Saves the extracted data into the database.

4. **`dump_journal(s, journal)`**:
   - Saves the execution log of scenarios to a file for later analysis.

5. **`main()`**:
   - Main function to run the module.

### Example Scenario

An example JSON scenario describes how to interact with specific product categories on a website. It includes:
- **URL of the Page**: For navigation and data extraction.
- **Category Name**: For identifying the category.
- **`presta_categories`**: Identifiers of categories in the PrestaShop database where products will be saved.

```json
{
    "scenarios": {
        "מינרל+לחויותלפניםמינרליםותמציותצמחים": {
            "url": "https://hbdeadsea.co.il/product-category/facial/moisture-face/",
            "name": "מינרל+לחויותלפניםמינרליםותמציותצמחים",
            "presta_categories": {
                "default_category": 11245,
                "additional_categories": [11288]
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Scenario Fields

- **`"scenario_name"`**: The name of the scenario.  (Implied from dict key)

  - **`"url"`**: The target address - a link to a category, section, or individual product.

  - **`"name"`**: The category name - it matches the name of the scenario.

  - **`"presta_categories"`**:
    - **`"default_category"`**: The default category ID in PrestaShop where products from this scenario will be categorized.
    - **`"additional_categories"`**: A list of additional category IDs in PrestaShop for further categorization.

    This field specifies the categories in the PrestaShop framework where the product data will be stored. During scenario execution, this information is used to update the relevant data in the database.
### How It Works

1. **Loading Scenarios**: The module loads and analyzes scenarios from files.

2. **Data Extraction**: Navigates to the URL from the scenario, extracts product links, and collects information about them.

3. **Data Saving**: Processes and saves the collected data into the database using category information from the scenario.

4. **Reports and Logging**: Maintains a log of scenario executions to track progress and record errors.

This module helps automate the collection and processing of product data from various sources, simplifying integration with different suppliers and product management systems.

# Changes Made

- Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) for the `Supplier` class and its methods, following Sphinx conventions.
- Implemented `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` for loading JSON data instead of `json.load`.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks.
- Replaced placeholder comments (`# ...`) with specific instructions.
- Added type hints (e.g., `from typing import List, Union`).
- Improved variable names for better clarity.
- Implemented the `dump_journal` method with error handling using `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Corrected potential type errors by including necessary imports and using appropriate `Union` types.
- Replaced overly generic descriptions in comments with specific verbs and more precise language (e.g., "processes" instead of "executes").
- Added missing imports necessary for the `Supplier` class to function.
- Improved code organization and readability by adding comments to separate blocks of logic and improve understanding.
