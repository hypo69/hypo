```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are defined in the provided code, so no tests can be written.
# To create meaningful tests, please provide a Python file with functions/classes to test.

# Example of how to write tests if you provide code:
#
# import hypotez.src.bots.discord  # Replace with the actual module path
#
# def test_mode_value():
#     """Tests the MODE constant."""
#     assert hypotez.src.bots.discord.MODE == 'dev'
#
# def test_mode_type():
#     """Tests that MODE is a string."""
#     assert isinstance(hypotez.src.bots.discord.MODE, str)
#
# def test_invalid_mode_assignment():
#     with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
#         hypotez.src.bots.discord.MODE = 'prod'
#
# # Example with a hypothetical function
# def test_some_function_with_input():
#     # Assume a function exists in the module
#     def some_function(input_value):
#         return input_value * 2
#
#     result = some_function(5)
#     assert result == 10
#
# def test_some_function_with_invalid_input():
#     def some_function(input_value):
#         return input_value * 2
#
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):  # Example of testing for TypeError
#         some_function("hello")
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Code to Test:** The provided code is just documentation strings and comments.  There are no functions, classes, or methods to test.  You must provide the actual Python code that defines functions or classes that you want tested.

2. **Example Tests (commented out):** The example tests demonstrate how to use `pytest` for different scenarios.  Crucially, it shows how to:
   - Import the module you want to test.
   - Use `pytest.raises` for exception handling.
   - Check the type of variables.
   - Test with valid and invalid input.
   - Test edge cases.  The provided code has no code to test.

3. **Replace Placeholders:**  Make sure you replace `"hypotez.src.bots.discord"` with the correct import path to your module.

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** The commented-out examples show basic exception handling using `pytest.raises`.  Real-world tests will need to adapt to specific error types or conditions in your functions/classes.  Provide more complex functions for a more comprehensive set of tests.

5. **Meaningful Tests:**  The quality of tests relies on the quality of the code being tested.  Tests should verify meaningful behavior, not just trivial assignments.

6. **Fixture Usage (if applicable):**  If your functions require setup or data, consider using `pytest` fixtures to provide this data.  The example shows how to use fixtures.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_discord_bot.py`) in the same directory as your Python module (`hypotez/src/bots/discord/__init__.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_discord_bot.py` from your terminal.


Remember to provide the actual Python code you want tested, and I can give you more specific and complete test cases.
