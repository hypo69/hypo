```python
import pytest

# Tests for the __init__.py file, which doesn't contain functions to test.
# Since there are no functions, no fixtures are needed.

def test_mode_value():
    """Checks that the MODE variable is correctly defined."""
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains import MODE
    assert MODE == 'dev'

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided Python code (`hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py`) only contains constant declarations.  There are no functions or classes to test.  Therefore, the test suite only needs to verify the value of the `MODE` constant.

* **`test_mode_value()`:** This test function directly imports the `MODE` constant from the target file and asserts that its value is 'dev'. This is the only relevant test case for this file.

* **No Fixtures:** Since there are no functions to take arguments, no fixtures are necessary.

* **Clear and Concise:** The test is focused and directly tests the single meaningful aspect of the file.

* **Correct Import:** The code uses the correct import path, assuming the file is correctly structured within a package.


This improved solution addresses the lack of testable code in the input by providing a minimal but adequate test suite for the `__init__.py` file.  If the provided code contained functions or classes, the tests would be significantly more elaborate. Remember to adapt the tests to the structure and logic of the actual functions and classes when they're present.
