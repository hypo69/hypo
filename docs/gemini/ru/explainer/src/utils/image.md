.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:

# <algorithm>

**save_png_from_url(image_url, filename):**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an aiohttp ClientSession.
2. **HTTP Request:** Sends a GET request to the image URL using the session.
3. **Error Handling:** Catches potential exceptions during the download process (e.g., network issues) and logs the error using the logger.
4. **Data Transfer:** Reads the downloaded image data.
5. **File Saving:** Calls the save_png function with the retrieved image data and filename.
6. **Return Value:** Returns the path to the saved file or None if the process fails.


**save_png(image_data, file_name):**

1. **Path Handling:** Creates a Path object from the filename.
2. **Directory Creation:** Creates necessary parent directories for the file using `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
3. **File Writing:** Opens the file in binary write mode ("wb") and writes the image data to it using aiofiles.
4. **Error Handling:** Checks if the file was created successfully and logs an error if not.  Also checks if the saved file has size 0, indicating possible corruption and logs the error.
5. **Image Saving:** Opens the saved file with PIL and saves it as PNG.
6. **Return Value:** Returns the path to the saved file as a string or None if there was an error.


**get_image_data(file_name):**

1. **File Existence Check:** Checks if the file exists using `exists()`.
2. **Error Handling:** Logs an error if the file does not exist.
3. **File Reading:** Opens the file in binary read mode ("rb") and reads its content.
4. **Error Handling:** Catches any exceptions during file reading and logs the error.
5. **Return Value:** Returns the binary data of the file or None if there was an error.

**Dependencies:**

* **`aiohttp`:** Used for asynchronous HTTP requests to download the image from the URL.
* **`aiofiles`:** Used for asynchronous file operations, specifically writing the image data to a file.
* **`PIL` (Pillow):** Used for image processing, specifically opening and saving the image in PNG format.
* **`pathlib`:** Used for handling file paths in a more object-oriented way.
* **`asyncio`:** Enables asynchronous operations in Python.
* **`logger` (from `src.logger`):** Used for logging errors and informational messages during the process. This means `src.logger` is a custom logger module within the project.
* **`pprint` (from `src.utils.printer`):** Used for pretty-printing output if needed. This implies `src.utils.printer` is a custom module for output formatting.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

* `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client for downloading images from URLs.
* `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file I/O for writing the downloaded image data.
* `PIL`: Python Imaging Library (Pillow) for handling image format (specifically PNG).
* `Pathlib`: For object-oriented file path manipulation.
* `asyncio`: Provides mechanisms for asynchronous programming.
* `src.logger`: Custom logger likely defined in a separate module within the project.  This means `logger` is a custom logging tool.
* `src.utils.printer`: Custom module for pretty printing output.  This is a utility module.

**Classes:**

There are no classes defined in this file.  The code is mainly composed of functions.


**Functions:**

* **`save_png_from_url(image_url, filename)`**: Downloads an image from a URL, saves it as a PNG file. This function is asynchronous, making it suitable for handling multiple image downloads concurrently.
* **`save_png(image_data, file_name)`**: Saves image data to a PNG file asynchronously. Takes binary data, creates required directory if needed, and checks for errors during the file saving process.
* **`get_image_data(file_name)`**: Reads the contents of a file and returns the binary data if it exists.  This function is synchronous and handles errors during file access.

**Variables:**

* `MODE`: A string variable likely used for configuration.
* `file_path`:  A Path object representing the file path to be saved or read.


**Error Handling:**

The code includes comprehensive error handling using `try...except` blocks to catch exceptions during both download and saving/reading operations.  Logging is utilized via the `logger` object to provide information about errors, particularly important for debugging and monitoring. Logging with `exc_info=True` is crucial for getting detailed traceback information.


**Possible Improvements:**

* **More Robust Error Handling:** Consider more specific exception types in `try...except` blocks to handle different types of errors during image download and saving (e.g., invalid image format, connection timeouts).
* **Progress Tracking:** Adding progress updates during the download and saving processes would enhance the user experience.
* **File Locking:** If multiple processes might access the same image file, file locking mechanisms should be considered.
* **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for HTTP requests to prevent indefinite blocking.
* **Metadata Handling:** Consider storing image metadata (like dimensions, format) if needed.

**Relationship with other parts of the project:**

The code heavily relies on `src.logger` and potentially `src.utils.printer`.  These modules are part of the project's utility functions and provide logging and printing capabilities, respectively. This indicates the codebase follows a modular design, promoting reusability and organization.
