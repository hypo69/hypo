```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are present in the provided code.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A placeholder is shown below.

def test_no_code_provided():
    """Tests are not possible as no code is present."""
    assert True  # Placeholder - Replace with actual assertions if code is provided.
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code snippet `hypotez/src/fast_api/gemini/backend/main.py` is empty.  There are no functions or classes to test.  Therefore, the generated test file provides a placeholder test function (`test_no_code_provided`) that asserts `True`.

**How to Write Tests Once Code is Provided:**

1. **Analyze the code:** Carefully examine the Python code (`main.py`) to identify functions, classes, and methods.  Note their input parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.

2. **Define test cases:**  Create test functions for each function/method/class.
    * **Valid Inputs:** Test the code with various valid inputs to ensure it works as expected.  Include different data types and sizes as appropriate.
    * **Invalid/Unexpected Inputs:** Test with inputs that are not valid or are unexpected.  This is crucial for robustness.  This might involve:
        * Passing incorrect data types.
        * Passing values outside expected ranges.
        * Passing empty or null values.
        * Testing for potential errors like `TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc. Use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.
    * **Edge Cases:**  Test the code at the boundaries of its input parameters (minimum, maximum, or other unusual values).
    * **Documentation:**  Use docstrings in the test functions to explain the purpose of each test.

3. **Use `pytest.raises`:** Use the `pytest.raises` context manager to test for expected exceptions.

4. **Fixtures (if needed):**  Create fixtures to generate test data for use in your tests if your functions require input data.

**Example with Placeholder Code (replace with actual code):**

```python
import pytest

def my_function(input_data):
    if input_data < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
    return input_data * 2

def test_my_function_positive_input():
    result = my_function(5)
    assert result == 10

def test_my_function_zero_input():
    result = my_function(0)
    assert result == 0

def test_my_function_negative_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        my_function(-5)
    assert str(excinfo.value) == "Input must be non-negative"
```

**To run the tests:**

1. Save the test file (e.g., `test_main.py`).
2. Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_main.py`
