# Test for missing/empty module imports (assuming these are appropriate)
#
# (If you have any imports in your code, make tests to check 
# for their presence in the module file)

#     assert 'module1' in sys.modules  # or other specific imports
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Test Cases:** The provided code only defines `OpenAIModel`. I've added tests for the `OpenAIModel` class.  Crucially, I added a test for an *invalid mode*.  This is a critical edge case you should always consider.

2. **Clear Test Descriptions:** The test function docstrings clearly explain what the test is checking.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_openai_model_invalid_mode` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions.

4. **Example for Other Functions:** I've commented out example tests for hypothetical functions from the `training` module.  You'll need to replace these placeholder comments with actual tests that cover *their* functionality.  This structure is extensible to other parts of your code, such as classes or other functions that might exist.

5. **Import Handling:** Added a placeholder `test_module_imports`.  You might want a test like this if your code imports other modules that are crucial for its operation.  Ensure they are importable.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_openai_model.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_openai_model.py`


**Important Considerations:**

* **`training` Module:** You need to add test cases for functions within the `training` module.  The example given assumes that functions are in the training module and would need appropriate imports and test functions.
* **Data-Driven Tests (if needed):** If your functions require input data, consider creating fixtures to provide this data in a reusable way.
* **Complex Logic:** For complex calculations or logic, add more detailed assertions to validate the output or behavior.


By adding tests for the `training` module (or whatever other parts are in your file) and making sure that the functions and modules import correctly, you can create a comprehensive test suite. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual tests for the functions in the `training` module. This structure provides a robust and reusable testing approach. Remember to adjust the examples to match the actual functionality within your `hypotez` code.
