**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `PwExecutor`:**  The original code only contained the declaration of a class and a `MODE` variable.  This solution mocks the class `PwExecutor` to provide test cases.  Crucially, it avoids errors if the actual `pw_executor.py` file is not present.

2. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are descriptive and clearly indicate the tested aspect (e.g., `test_pw_executor_init_valid_mode`, `test_get_mode`).

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests cover the `__init__`, `get_mode`, and `set_mode` methods. This covers the core functionality.

4. **Edge Case Tests:** Tests now include a test for `test_pw_executor_init_invalid_mode` to demonstrate proper handling of invalid input (though the original code might not have any).  Additional edge cases would depend on the `PwExecutor` class logic.

5. **Exception Handling (Example):**  The `test_pw_executor_invalid_input` example shows how to test exception handling using `pytest.raises`.  Crucially, this would need to be adapted to the actual exception and method you want to test.


**How to Use:**

1. **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_pw_executor.py`).
2. **Run:** Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_pw_executor.py`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Replace the Mock:** If you have the `pw_executor.py` file available, replace the mock class (`PwExecutor`) with the actual import statement.
* **More Tests:**  Add more tests based on the methods and attributes of the `PwExecutor` class. Include tests for any external libraries used, files, or additional logic. The example demonstrates testing external libraries.
* **Data-driven Testing (Optional):** If you expect data to be used by external functions or your code, use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to create multiple test cases that use different data inputs, which is often essential for edge cases and robust validation.
* **Real File System Handling (if needed):**  If the code interacts with the file system, use `pytest` fixtures to manage temporary files (the `tmp_path` example in the comments shows how to create temporary files and directories for testing).  This is best practice for tests that interact with the file system.


Remember to adapt the examples and test cases to the actual logic and functionality of your `pw_executor.py` code.  These updated tests should offer much greater coverage and be easier to adapt to the actual implementation.
