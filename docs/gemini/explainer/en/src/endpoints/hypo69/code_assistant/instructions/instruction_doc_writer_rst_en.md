# INSTRUCTION

For each input Python file, create documentation in `rst` format for subsequent compilation with Sphinx. The documentation must meet the following requirements:

1. **Documentation Format**:
   - Use the `reStructuredText (rst)` standard.
   - Each file should begin with a header and a brief description of its contents.
   - For all classes and functions, use the following comment format:
     ```python
     def function(param: str, param1: Optional[str | dict | str] = None) -> dict | None:
         """
         Args:
             param (str): Description of the `param` parameter.
             param1 (Optional[str | dict | str], optional): Description of the `param1` parameter. Defaults to `None`.

         Returns:
             dict | None: Description of the return value. Returns a dictionary or `None`.

         Raises:
             SomeError: Description of the situation in which the `SomeError` exception is raised.
         """
     ```
   - Use `ex` instead of `e` in exception handling blocks.

2. **TOC Tree**:
   - Include sections in the documentation using `.. toctree::`.
   - The structure of the `index.rst` file should contain links to all module descriptions.

3. **Documentation Formatting**:
   - All class, function, and method headers should be documented using Sphinx directives (`autoclass`, `autofunction`).
   - Example:
     ```rst
     .. automodule:: module_name
         :members:
         :undoc-members:
         :show-inheritance:
     ```

4. **Section Headings**:
   - Use level 1 headers (`=`), level 2 headers (`-`), level 3 headers (`~`), and level 4 headers (`^`).

5. **Example File**:
   ```rst
   Module Name
   ===========\n

   .. automodule:: module_name
       :members:
       :undoc-members:
       :show-inheritance:

   Functions
   ---------\n

   .. autofunction:: module_name.function_name
   ```

Generate the corresponding documentation for each input Python file in `rst` format.

# <algorithm>

The algorithm is to generate reStructuredText (rst) documentation for Python code.  It involves:

1. **Input:** A Python file.
2. **Processing:**
   * **Header Generation:**  Creates an `rst` header section including the module name and a brief description of its contents, using a format specified in the instruction.
   * **Autodoc Directives:** Generates directives to automatically document classes and functions.  The code block in the input provides exact formatting of Sphinx autodoc directives (`.. automodule`, `.. autofunction`) which will extract the documentation strings (docstrings) from the Python code and insert them into the `rst` file.  This step will also insert appropriate section headings.
   * **TOC Integration (if needed):** For `index.rst` files, integrates `.. toctree::` directives to structure links to other modules' documents.
3. **Output:** An `rst` file containing the documentation for the given Python file following the specified structure.

Example Data Flow:

```
  Python File (input.py) -->  [Doc Generation Logic] -->  rst_file_output.rst
```


# <explanation>

This code snippet acts as a set of instructions for generating documentation, not the actual code to be executed.  It doesn't implement the logic to parse the Python files and produce the `rst` files.   The example `rst` output demonstrates the format expected for the generated documentation, guiding the implementation of the documentation generation process.

* **Imports:** There are no imports in the provided code; it's a set of instructions/documentation templates.  This is an important aspect of the documentation itself,  it is about the *creation* of documentation.
* **Classes:** No classes are defined within the instructions.
* **Functions:** The code emphasizes the `function` definition structure with detailed docstrings (documentation within a function) that must be followed.
* **Variables:** There are no variables to be explained in this code snippet.
* **Potential Errors/Improvements:**
    * The instruction is not self-sufficient.  It relies on external Python code to actually implement the processes suggested. A separate, actual Python script would be required to parse Python files, extract docstrings, and format them into `rst` files.  Libraries like `sphinx`, `pydoc`, or custom tools to accomplish the documentation generation are required.
    * The instruction lacks crucial details needed for practical implementation:
        *  A complete template for handling exceptions or errors. This instruction mentions it, but how the implementation will handle parsing errors or Python syntax errors in the input files is not defined.
        *  A mechanism for parsing Python code from files or stdin.


**Relationship to Other Parts of the Project:** This instruction is meant to be a *guide* for creating documentation for the Python code contained elsewhere in the project.  It implies that the documentation generation script would be part of a larger build/documentation process using Sphinx, for example.
