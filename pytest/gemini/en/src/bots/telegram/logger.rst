```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The original example was missing code to test, so placeholder tests like `test_mode_value` and `test_mode_type` are used. These directly test the constant.


2. **Clearer Comments:** Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test.

3. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  The test `test_log_message_invalid_mode` shows an example of how to test exception handling with `pytest.raises()`. This is crucial for robust tests, particularly if the code expects different input types or invalid states.


4. **Example function for a more complex test:** The code now includes an example of a more realistic function `log_message` that might use the `MODE` constant.  This example shows how you would set up logging using `logging.basicConfig()` and then use assertions to confirm that the message is logged at the correct level.  **Crucially,** you would need to adjust the assertions depending on how the `log_message` function is interacting with the `logging` module.

5. **Realistic Testing:** The key to effective testing is to have a function (`log_message`) to test that uses `MODE` and the logging module.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger.py`


**Critical Considerations for Real Testing:**

* **Logging Configuration:**  The example tests for `log_message` include `logging.basicConfig()`. You must configure logging appropriately for your tests. In a real-world scenario, the logger will be configured elsewhere. This test would need more sophisticated checking methods that verify if the message was logged to the correct level. You might use capture mechanisms to verify log messages.
* **Mocking:** For testing functions that interact with external services or modules (e.g., external API calls), you should use mocking (using `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock`) to isolate the tests and avoid relying on actual external behavior.
* **Code Coverage:**  Use a code coverage tool (e.g., `coverage`) to ensure you are testing as much of the `logger.py` file as possible.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual code and test cases for a full test suite.  Always test with a variety of inputs and edge cases to ensure that your code is robust. Remember to adjust the comments and assertions for your specific implementation.
