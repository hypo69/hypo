def test_security_md_report_instructions():
    """Checks if the report instructions section is present."""
    # This will need more detailed checks in real scenario
    # (e.g., checking for keywords, looking for sections with instructions).
    # Example:
    expected_keyword = "Please do not"  
    assert expected_keyword in security_md_content, "Report instructions not found."


# Example usage assuming you load the markdown content into a variable
#  This placeholder will be replaced by the actual content if available.
# security_md_content = """Your MD content here..."""

# Add more test functions as needed based on the specific requirements
# and features of the provided code, such as checking for keywords, links, etc.
# Remember to replace placeholders with your code when the source code for testing is ready.
