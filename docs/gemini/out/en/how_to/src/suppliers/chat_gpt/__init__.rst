How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet imports necessary modules and defines a global variable `MODE` with the value 'dev'.  It specifically imports the `GptGs` class from the `gsheet.py` module within the `src.suppliers.chat_gpt` directory.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code sets a global variable named `MODE` to the string 'dev'.  This variable likely controls the operational mode of the application (e.g., development mode).

2. The code imports the `GptGs` class from a module named `gsheet.py`, which is located in the `src.suppliers.chat_gpt` subdirectory. This import statement makes the `GptGs` class available for use in other parts of the project.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.chat_gpt import GptGs

    # Assuming you have initialized the necessary dependencies.
    # ... (e.g., Google Sheets API client) ...

    gpt_gs = GptGs()  # This will likely initialize an object using the GptGs class from gsheet.py.
    # ... (Use the gpt_gs object for operations with Google Sheets,  as defined in gsheet.py)...

    print(gpt_gs) # Example usage.  The output will depend on the implementation of GptGs.
