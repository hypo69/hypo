**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints and docstrings in RST format for `get_project_root` function.
- Imported `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for safe JSON loading.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` to handle potential errors and use the correct utility function.
- Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings loading, preventing crashes.
- Modified variable names to be more descriptive and consistent (e.g., `__root__` to `PROJECT_ROOT`).
- Improved error handling: Now prints informative messages when `settings.json` is not found or cannot be parsed, and gracefully handles the situation by using an empty dictionary.
- Changed `copyrihgnt` to `copyright` in settings.
- Added `read_text` with encoding to handle README.
- Made sure that all strings are properly assigned to avoid potential `NoneType` errors.


**Explanation of Improvements**:

The improved code addresses the potential for errors (missing files, invalid JSON) and uses more robust error handling.  It also clarifies the intent of the code by adding comprehensive docstrings in RST format. Using `j_loads` is crucial for proper error handling during JSON loading.  Importantly, the code now gracefully handles the absence of `settings.json` or errors during its parsing by assigning an empty dictionary (`{}`) to `settings`. This prevents the program from crashing, allowing it to continue running even if the configuration file is missing or corrupted.  It also checks for the README and returns an empty string if it's not found. This avoids `AttributeError`.   The overall structure is improved by adding appropriate type hints and variable names.  These improvements make the code more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.
