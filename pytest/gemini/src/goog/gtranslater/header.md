**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now includes `mock_file_exists` and `MockFS` to mock file system interactions, making the tests independent of the actual file system. This is crucial for reliable testing.  The `monkeypatch` approach in previous responses is used for dealing with sys.path, which is also crucial to ensure test isolation.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, clearly indicating the input and expected behavior.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests cover valid inputs, missing marker files, and multiple marker files. Critically, the tests now use the mock fixture to test the case where `pyproject.toml` is in the parent directory, avoiding the problem where the tests sometimes failed because they were in a test directory structure that didn't precisely match the project structure.
* **Exception Handling:** Tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are now included.  These were previously missing and crucial for testing robustness.  The example code lacked proper error handling in the original file.
* **Fixture for Mocking:** The `mock_fs` fixture provides a standardized way to control file system behavior in the tests.
* **Import Statements:**  The necessary imports for the tests are now included at the top, and correct mocking is included to make these tests work.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Create a `pyproject.toml` and `settings.json` in a suitable location (e.g. the project root or a test directory):** This allows you to test the different cases of file existence and contents.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

Remember to adapt the file paths in the mock functions (`mock_file_exists` and `mock_open`) to match your project structure if it's different.  This improved version is significantly more robust and demonstrates best practices for testing Python code using `pytest`. Remember to run pytest in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.

# Example settings.json file
{
    "project_name": "MyProject",
    "version": "1.0.0",
