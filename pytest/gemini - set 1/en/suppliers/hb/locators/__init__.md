#Example of how you would test specific parts of the locator module if you had content
#If .locator had a function like:
#def get_location(input_data):

#     input_data = {...} # Replace with actual valid input
#     expected_location = "..." # Replace with the expected location
#     assert get_location(input_data) == expected_location

# def test_get_location_invalid_input():
#     """Checks get_location with invalid input."""
#     input_data = {...} # Replace with actual invalid input
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         get_location(input_data)
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "..." # Replace with expected error message

# def test_get_location_edge_case():
#      """Checks get_location with an edge case."""
#     input_data = "..." #Replace with an edge case input
#     expected_location = "..." # Replace with the expected location, or exception
#     assert get_location(input_data) == expected_location
#     #or
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
#         get_location(input_data)
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "..."
#

#The commented tests are example implementations, uncomment and adapt these as required based on the functionality of .locator to test it thoroughly.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Import:** The code assumes you have a `.version` module and a `.locator` module. The imports ensure you're accessing the correct modules.  Crucially, if your code has additional modules you need to test, import them appropriately.
2. **Missing Code:**  The provided code snippet was very minimal. The most critical part is the `locator.py` file. Without that, we can only test the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` attributes (which were given).  **Your tests must be based on the actual contents of the locator module.**
3. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The example tests are *very* basic. To properly test the `locator` module, you need test cases that cover various input scenarios (both valid and invalid), edge cases, and potential exceptions the locator function might raise.  Provide the content of the `.locator` file, and I'll generate much more complete test cases.
4. **Error Handling:** The example test cases include `pytest.raises` for exception handling.
5. **Data-Driven Testing:** If the `locator` module has functions that accept data (e.g., a list of locations, or other parameters), you'll need appropriate `pytest` fixtures to supply various data sets. The provided example illuStartes how to include a fixture for this kind of functionality.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the example `input_data`, `expected_location`, and error messages with the actual values used in your `locator` module.
2. **Add Tests:** Add more tests based on the different functionalities in `locator.py`.
3. **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to execute the tests: `pytest test_locators.py` (or the name of your test file).

Remember to adapt the test cases based on the actual structure and logic of your `locator` module. Provide the `.locator` module contents for a more precise and useful set of tests.
