**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `KazarinovTelegramBot`:** The code now includes a `mock_kazarinov_bot` fixture to mock the `KazarinovTelegramBot` class.  This is crucial because the actual implementation is missing.  This allows us to test the *interactions* with the bot, rather than relying on its internal implementation.  The `test_bot_creation` test ensures a mock instance can be created.

2. **`test_bot_send_message`:**  This test now focuses on the `send_message` method.  Since the `send_message` method is a placeholder, we now only test it for lack of exceptions.

3. **`test_invalid_input`:** This test uses `pytest.raises` to verify that the `send_message` method raises the expected `TypeError` when given an inappropriate input (in this case, an integer or string not fitting expected type).

4. **`@pytest.mark.parametrize`:** This decorator is used for testing multiple cases with different inputs.

5. **Comprehensive Tests:**  We've included tests for the `MODE` variable to ensure its correct value and type, covering the *only* implementation in the provided code, and testing with and without mocked implementation of `KazarinovTelegramBot`.

6. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more explicit about their purpose.

7. **Docstrings:** Docstrings are added to the test functions to explain their functionality.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_kazarinov.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_kazarinov.py`


Remember to replace the placeholder implementations of `KazarinovTelegramBot` if the code is complete, and adapt the tests accordingly to match the expected behavior of the `send_message` method.
