# File: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/api.py

This file provides a Python class (`Prestashop`) for interacting with the PrestaShop WebService API.  It handles various API operations, including CRUD, searching, and image uploads.

## Class: `Prestashop`

This class encapsulates the interactions with the PrestaShop API.

**Description:**

The `Prestashop` class provides methods to perform different actions on PrestaShop resources (e.g., products, categories, taxes).  It includes error handling for API responses and supports JSON and XML data formats.  Crucially, it handles the complexities of making requests, parsing responses, and dealing with potential errors from the API.  Asynchronous image uploads are also available.


**Constructor (`__init__`)**:

* Initializes the `Prestashop` object with connection details (API domain, API key), default language, and debug mode.
* Establishes a connection to the PrestaShop API.
* Validates the API connection by sending a HEAD request to check server availability.

**Methods (Summary):**

* **`ping()`**: Checks if the PrestaShop API is reachable and responsive.
* **`_check_response()`**: Crucial internal method that handles HTTP response codes.  It checks for errors, logs them appropriately, and handles different possible error formats (JSON, XML).
* **`_parse_response_error()`**: Parses detailed error responses from PrestaShop, handling JSON and XML error structures.
* **`_prepare()`**: Prepares the URL for the API request by adding parameters to the base URL.
* **`_exec()`**: Core method for executing API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Takes various parameters for filtering, sorting, and data manipulation. This method is the crucial interface for handling different API operations.
* **`create()`**: Creates a new resource in PrestaShop.
* **`read()`**: Retrieves a resource by ID.
* **`write()`**: Updates an existing resource.
* **`unlink()`**: Deletes a resource.
* **`search()`**: Performs a search operation on PrestaShop resources.
* **`create_binary()`**: Uploads a binary file (e.g., an image).  Handles image upload to the specified Prestashop resource path.
* **`_save()`**: Saves the fetched data to a JSON file.
* **`get_data()`**: Fetches data from a resource, saves it, and returns it.
* **`remove_file()`**: Removes a file from the filesystem, crucial for cleanup after image uploads.
* **`get_apis()`**: Retrieves a list of available APIs.
* **`get_languages_schema()`**: Retrieves the schema for languages.
* **`upload_image_async()`**: Uploads an image asynchronously, handling file saving and removal.
* **`upload_image()`**: Uploads an image synchronously.
* **`get_product_images()`**: Fetches images for a specific product.


**Error Handling**:

The code includes comprehensive error handling (using `try...except` blocks) for different situations, including incorrect API keys, network issues, and issues with parsing the API responses.  Error messages are logged to provide detailed information about the error.  Specifically, the `_check_response` and `_parse_response_error` methods ensure robust error detection and handling for API calls.


**Data Format (`Format` enum):**

The code uses an `Enum` to represent data formats (JSON and XML).  Although XML support exists, the code strongly prefers JSON.


**Dependencies**:

* `requests`
* `xml.etree.ElementTree`
* `xml.parsers.expat`
* custom modules (`gs`, `utils/file`, `utils/convertors`, `utils/image`, `utils/printer`, `utils/jjson`, `logger`)

**Example Usage (from the docstring):**

The docstring provides clear example usage of the `Prestashop` class to illustrate how to create, update, delete, and search for resources, and upload images.

**Overall Assessment**:

This code demonstrates a well-structured and robust approach to interacting with the PrestaShop API.  The use of error handling, logging, and clear method definitions makes the code maintainable and reliable. The asynchronous image upload is a great feature, handling file management. This is a well-designed class for interacting with the PrestaShop API, demonstrating a good understanding of API interaction and proper error management.
