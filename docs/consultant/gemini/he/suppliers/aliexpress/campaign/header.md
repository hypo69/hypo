```

**Changes Made**

- Added a docstring to the module explaining its purpose.
- Created a function `__setup_module_path()` to handle the path setup in a more organized way, and to improve error handling and logging.
- Used `logger.error` for error handling and output instead of just raising an exception (for better logging).
- Added `from src.logger import logger` to import the logger.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `__root__` to `root_dir`).
- Added exception handling using `try...except` with appropriate error logging to gracefully handle potential `ValueError` exceptions that might arise if the project directory is not found.
- Included comments in the code using the `#` symbol to explain individual lines where appropriate.
- Removed redundant lines (`#!` lines).
