**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  Crucially, fixtures (`dummy_settings_file`, `dummy_readme_file`, `mock_gs_path`) are used to create temporary files and mock the `gs.path` object. This isolates the tests and avoids side effects.
* **Error Handling:** Tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings and README loading, covering the `try...except` blocks in the original code.  Using `pytest.raises` is essential for this.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific, checking the expected types and values.
* **Comprehensive Cases:** Tests now cover:
    * Valid input (project root found).
    * Missing marker files.
    * Multiple marker files (checks for the correct root).
    * Case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`.
    * `FileNotFoundError` cases for both settings and README.
* **`mock_gs_path`:**  This fixture is crucial for mocking the `gs.path` object.  It allows the tests to control where the files are expected to be.
* **Mocking `sys.path` (not recommended):**  While technically possible to mock `sys.path`, it's generally **not recommended** to modify system-level variables within a test.  The solution now avoids it.
* **Dummy Data:** The code now includes dummy data (`dummy_settings_json`, `dummy_readme_md`) for testing.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed.
2.  Save the test code (as `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and effective set of tests that cover various scenarios, including error handling and edge cases, following the best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to adjust the paths to match the location of your actual files in your project.  Crucially, the tests now ensure that the `header.py` code behaves correctly in a variety of situations without causing unpredictable behavior or relying on external files.
