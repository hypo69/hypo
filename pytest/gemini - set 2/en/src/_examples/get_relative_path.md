**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `get_relative_path`:**  Crucially, the code now imports the function from the correct module (`hypotez.src.utils.path`).  This is vital for running the tests correctly.

2. **`Path(__file__)` within the tests:**  The test cases now use `Path(__file__).resolve()` to get the absolute path of the test file itself.  This is a crucial fix and ensures the tests work reliably, regardless of where you run them from.

3. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_get_relative_path_base_path_not_found` test now demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to catch and check for `FileNotFoundError` exceptions.  Importantly, the improved test now checks for the *specific* error message.  This is crucial for robust testing.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are now more descriptive, explaining what is expected and handling edge cases.

5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The tests now cover scenarios like empty base paths (`test_get_relative_path_empty_base_path`), and cases where the current file or base path don't exist (`test_get_relative_path_base_path_not_found`, `test_get_relative_path_current_file_not_found`).

6. **Fixture Not Needed:**  Since the function is not dependent on any other data/object, there's no need for a fixture in these tests.


**To run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the test code (e.g., as `test_get_relative_path.py`) in the same directory as the `get_relative_path.py` file.
3. Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_get_relative_path.py`


This revised solution is much more robust and comprehensive, covering a wider range of potential issues and using best practices for `pytest` testing. Remember to adapt the paths to your actual file structure if needed. Remember to adapt the `import` statement if the file structure differs.
