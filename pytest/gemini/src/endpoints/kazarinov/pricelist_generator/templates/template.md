```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test, only HTML template.
#  Therefore, no test functions can be written.

#pytest will not be able to execute any tests without Python code to test.
# This is a placeholder.  Actual tests would depend on the Python code
# that renders this HTML template.

# Example showing how to use the template if the template is to be rendered,
# and how pytest tests might be written if rendering logic exists.
# This is purely illustrative, as no Python code was provided to render.

# Placeholder to show how tests might look if rendering code existed.
# Replace with actual test functions if you have the Python code to render.

# @pytest.fixture
# def template_data():
#     return {
#         "title": "Example Price List",
#         "description": "List of products",
#         "products": [
#             {"image_local_saved_path": "image1.jpg", "product_title": "Product 1", "product_description": "Description 1", "specification": "Spec 1"},
#             {"image_local_saved_path": "image2.jpg", "product_title": "Product 2", "product_description": "Description 2", "specification": "Spec 2"},
#         ],
#         "price": 100,
#         "currency": "USD",
#     }

# def test_template_renders_title(template_data):
#     # This function will be executed and compared to expected output if a rendering function is implemented.
#     # ... your rendering logic...
#     # assert rendered_html.find("<h1>Example Price List</h1>") != -1 # Example assertion.

# def test_template_renders_product_info(template_data):
#     # ... your rendering logic...
#     # assert rendered_html.find("<h3>Product 1</h3>") != -1
#     # assert rendered_html.find("Description 1") != -1

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided HTML template is a view; it does not contain any Python code.  Therefore, no tests can be written *directly* for the HTML.  Tests would need to be written for the *Python code* that renders this template, passing data into it, and receiving the rendered HTML as output.

* **Missing Python Code:**  To write meaningful tests, you need the Python code that takes the template and the data and generates the HTML.  This is the code that needs unit testing.

* **Example Test Structure (Illustrative):** The commented-out code demonstrates how a `@pytest.fixture` could be used to create data for the template and how test functions would be structured to check that the rendered HTML contains the expected elements.


* **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder comments (`# ... your rendering logic...`) with the actual Python code that does the template rendering, and fill in the assertions in the `test_` functions appropriately.  The assertions should verify the generated HTML strings contain the expected text content.

* **Rendering Library (Important):** If you are using a templating engine (like Jinja2), you would need to include those library imports in your test file and call the engine with the data, rather than directly string-manipulating the template.  pytest is used to test *Python* code.


**Key takeaway:**  Focus on testing the *Python* code, not directly the static HTML. The HTML template only determines *what* the rendered output should look like.  The Python code determines *how* the HTML is generated.
