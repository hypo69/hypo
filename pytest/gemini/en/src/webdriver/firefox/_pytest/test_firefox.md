**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Functions:** The provided code snippets lacked any actual functionality.  I've created mock functions `get_firefox_driver`, `configure_firefox_driver`, and `close_firefox_driver` to represent the parts of the actual code you'd be testing. Replace these mock functions with the real code you want to test.

2. **`test_firefox_setup` Function:** This test function now calls the mock functions.  Crucially, it tests the complete flow by first getting the driver, configuring it, and then closing it (via mock functions).

3. **`test_firefox_setup_with_invalid_driver`:** This test specifically checks for a `TypeError` if an invalid driver type is passed to `configure_firefox_driver`, demonstrating exception handling.

4. **`test_firefox_setup_invalid_input`:** Checks if the `close_firefox_driver` function raises a `TypeError` if it receives incorrect input, which is an important edge case.

5. **`test_firefox_setup_success`:** Checks if the setup (and close) is successful returning a boolean.  Asserting the result against True ensures that the driver creation and closing processes are working as intended.

6. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names (e.g., `test_firefox_setup_with_invalid_driver`) clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

7. **`pytest.raises`:** The tests utilize `pytest.raises` to verify that the correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code above as `test_firefox.py`.
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using:
    ```bash
    pytest test_firefox.py
    ```

**Next Steps (Crucial):**

*   **Replace the Mock Functions:**  Replace the mock functions with your actual code to test the functionality of the original `webdriver` functions. This will greatly enhance the utility of the test suite.
*   **Add More Tests:** Create more test cases to cover different scenarios (e.g., different driver types, handling of errors during configuration, closing issues, etc.).  Think about specific error conditions or unexpected inputs that the real functions could receive.
*   **Use Fixtures (if needed):** If the functions under test require data or setup, use `pytest` fixtures to provide the data and avoid redundancy.


By following these improvements and adding the real code, your test suite will be much more comprehensive and useful in ensuring the stability and correctness of your Firefox WebDriver implementation. Remember to test edge cases and unusual scenarios.
