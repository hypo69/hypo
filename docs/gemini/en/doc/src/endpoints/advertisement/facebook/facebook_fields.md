# Facebook Fields

## Overview

This module defines a class `FacebookFields` for handling Facebook advertisement and event fields. It loads data from a JSON file to populate attributes representing these fields.


## Classes

### `FacebookFields`

**Description**: This class is designed to manage fields related to Facebook advertisements and events.  It loads data from a JSON file and sets class attributes based on the loaded data.

**Methods**:

- `__init__`: Initializes the `FacebookFields` object and loads the data from the JSON file.
- `_payload`: Loads the JSON data, parses it, and sets the corresponding attributes of the class.


## Functions

(No functions defined in the provided code.)


## Attributes

- `MODE`:  A string representing the application mode. Currently set to 'dev'.



## Implementation Details

**`FacebookFields.__init__`**:  The constructor initializes an instance of the class.  Crucially, it calls the private method `_payload` to perform the data loading and attribute setting.

**`FacebookFields._payload`**: This method loads data from a JSON file (`facebook_feilds.json`) located in a predefined path (`gs.path.src/advertisement/facebok/facebook_feilds.json`).  It parses the loaded JSON data and sets attributes of the class based on the keys and values in the JSON.  If the file loading or parsing fails, it logs a debug message and returns `None`. This approach allows for graceful handling of potential errors during data loading.

**Error Handling:** The code includes a check `if not data:` to handle cases where the JSON file is empty or cannot be loaded successfully. In these situations, a debugging message is logged, and the method returns `None`. This ensures that the application doesn't crash due to issues during data loading.
