**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Clearer Docstrings:**  Improved docstrings for `__init__` and `upload_data_to_sheet` explain parameters, potential errors, and the purpose of each method more explicitly.

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError`, `pd.errors.EmptyDataError`, and other exceptions.  This is crucial for robustness.  The exceptions are now caught and informative error messages are logged.  The `except Exception as e:` block now properly uses `logger.exception` to include the full traceback.

* **Empty File Check:** The `upload_data_to_sheet` method now checks if the DataFrame read from the CSV is empty. If it is, a warning is logged, and the function returns early to prevent errors.  This is essential for preventing unexpected behavior and helps avoid writing nothing to the sheet.

* **Worksheet Existence Check:** Added a check to make sure the worksheet exists *before* attempting to update it.  This prevents an error if the worksheet hasn't been created yet, which happens in a new spreadsheet context.


* **`get_worksheet` usage:** `get_worksheet` now automatically handles the creation and retrieval of worksheets, ensuring they are ready for data upload.

* **`__init__` improvement:** The `__init__` method now directly handles the creation or opening of the spreadsheet based on the `spreadsheet_id` and logs accordingly. It also has a more complete error handling for potential problems.


This revised code is significantly more robust, informative, and less prone to unexpected behavior.  Remember to replace the placeholder `gs.path.secrets` with the actual path to your credentials file.  Also, configure the `logger` appropriately in your `src.logger` module. Remember to handle potential errors throughout your code.  A complete error handling strategy would include checks for other possible exceptions (e.g., network issues).
