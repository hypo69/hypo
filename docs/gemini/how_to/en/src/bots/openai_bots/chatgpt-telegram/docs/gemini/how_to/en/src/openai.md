How to use the `openai.js` file

This file provides a JavaScript class, `OpenAI`, for interacting with the OpenAI API.  It handles both chat completions and audio transcriptions.

**Import:**

```javascript
import { openai } from './openai'; // Adjust path if needed
```

**Usage:**

**1.  Chat Completions:**

   - **Initialize:** You need an OpenAI API key.  The `openai` instance is already created and exported for you.  You don't need to create a new `OpenAI` instance unless you need different configuration.

   - **Structure Messages:** The `chat` function takes an array of messages as input. Each message is an object with `role` and `content` properties.  `role` can be one of `ASSISTANT`, `USER`, or `SYSTEM` (defined in the class).

   ```javascript
   import { openai } from './openai';

   const messages = [
       { role: openai.roles.SYSTEM, content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
       { role: openai.roles.USER, content: 'What is the capital of France?' },
   ];

   async function getAnswer() {
       const response = await openai.chat(messages);
       if (response) {
           console.log(response.content); // Output the assistant's response
       } else {
           console.error('No response from OpenAI.');
       }
   }
   getAnswer();
   ```

   This example sets a system message, followed by a user message, and then retrieves the answer from OpenAI.  Critically, the `response` object may be `undefined` (in the case of an error), so you need to check for it.

**2. Audio Transcription:**

   - **Filepath:** Provide the path to the audio file you want to transcribe.

   ```javascript
   import { openai } from './openai';
   const filePath = '/path/to/your/audio.wav'; // Replace with the actual path

   async function transcribeAudio() {
       const transcription = await openai.transcription(filePath);
       if (transcription) {
           console.log(transcription);
       } else {
           console.error("Transcription failed.");
       }
   }

   transcribeAudio();
   ```

**Error Handling:**

- Both `chat` and `transcription` methods include `try...catch` blocks.  The `console.log` inside the `catch` block logs errors to the console.  **Critical:**  Your application should implement more robust error handling for production environments, e.g., retrying on transient errors, logging errors to a dedicated service or database, and displaying user-friendly error messages.  Always check if the `response` object is `undefined` before using the data, as in the above chat example.

**Important Considerations:**

* **API Key:** Ensure that the `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable or `config.get('OPENAI_KEY')` correctly references your OpenAI API key.
* **Dependencies:**  This code relies on `openai`, `config`, and `fs` node modules. Install them if you don't have them:
   ```bash
   npm install openai config fs
   ```
* **File System Access:**  The `transcription` method requires reading from the file system, so make sure you have the appropriate file access permissions.
* **Rate Limits:** The OpenAI API has rate limits.  Your application should account for these limitations to avoid exceeding them.
* **Large Files:** For very large audio files, consider breaking down the transcription into smaller segments to avoid memory issues.

This guide outlines the basic usage.  You can extend it further to incorporate more sophisticated interaction with the OpenAI API. Remember to adapt the file paths and error handling to fit your specific needs.
