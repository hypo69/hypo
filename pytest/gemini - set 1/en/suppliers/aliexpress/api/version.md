```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Error Handling:** The tests now include `try...except NameError` blocks. This is vital.  If the variables aren't defined correctly, you'll get a `NameError` which will crash the tests.  This prevents your tests from failing silently and ensures you catch these critical definition errors.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific aspect being tested (e.g., `test_version_value`).

3. **Type Checking:**  Critically, tests now verify the *type* of the variables (`__version__`, `__author__`, etc.) using `isinstance()`. This ensures they're actually strings, as expected.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover the existence and expected types for all variables (`__version__`, `__name__`, `__author__`, `__details__`).  This is a significant improvement, as the previous version only checked the `__version__`.

5. **`pytest.raises` not needed:**  The code didn't have any functions that raise exceptions, so `pytest.raises` wasn't necessary.

6. **Fixtures (not needed):**  There are no functions needing fixtures in this example.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
3.  Place the original `version.py` file in the `suppliers/aliexpress/api` directory (or adjust the import path in the tests accordingly).
4.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_version.py
    ```

This revised test suite is significantly more robust and thorough in verifying the correctness and integrity of the `version.py` module.  It checks for existence, type, and even the expected values of the variables. This is crucial for reliable testing in real-world applications. Remember to adapt the import paths if your file structure differs. Remember that the structure `suppliers/aliexpress/api` should exist in your project. If it doesn't you will need to create this structure.
