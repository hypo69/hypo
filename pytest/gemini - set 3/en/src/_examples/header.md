```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.fixture` for `tmpdir`:** The provided `tmpdir` fixture from `pytest` is crucial for creating temporary files and directories during testing, isolating each test from affecting others.

2. **Dummy Files:** The `dummy_files` fixture now creates the necessary `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files within a temporary directory.  This is much better than trying to rely on files in a specific location.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The code now covers various scenarios:
   - Files in the current directory.
   - Files in parent/grandparent directories.
   - No marker files found.
   - Multiple marker files (testing that the function correctly chooses the correct folder).
   - A marker file does not exist.

4. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a test case (`test_set_project_root_marker_not_exists`) for checking how the code handles a missing marker file.

5. **`settings.json` and `README.MD` Testing:**
   -  Crucially, I've added fixtures (`tmp_settings_file`, and you should add one for `tmp_readme_file`) to create temporary `settings.json` files with controlled content. This allows for testing the scenarios you need. These are *essential* because your original code assumes a `settings.json` file exists, and your tests need to replicate this with known, temporary, and controlled data.

6. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive.

7. **Separation of Concerns:** The fixture helps to keep file setup independent of tests, promoting isolated testing.

8. **Missing `import json`:** The import statement `import json` was missing from your original code, and I've added it to this solution.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the test code in a file named (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations for the next set of tests:**

- **Mock `gs.path.root`:**  For testing the part of your code that handles the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files, it's extremely important to *mock* or replace `gs.path.root` in the `test_header` module to prevent your tests from depending on the actual filesystem during testing. (Mock it in the fixture, so each test runs in a clean, isolated environment.)
- **Error Handling:** Add specific tests for exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when reading the configuration files.  Your code already has *try-except* blocks, so the tests should verify those are properly used. This is crucial because your code handles these errors and needs to be tested to make sure they're handled correctly.
- **`__root__` Handling:** Test that `__root__` is properly added to `sys.path`.  It's crucial to test this part.
- **Data Validation:**  Check that the loaded data (from `settings.json` and `README.MD`) is correctly parsed.  What if the `settings.json` file isn't properly formatted JSON?
