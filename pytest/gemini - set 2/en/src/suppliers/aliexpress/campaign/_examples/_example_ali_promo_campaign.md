**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs`:** The original code relied on the `gs` module which is not available in a standard pytest environment. The code now mocks the `gs` module using `unittest.mock`. This isolates the tests from the external dependencies of `gs`.  You'll need to adapt the `MockGS` class if `gs.path` has a different structure.

2. **Mocking `get_directory_names`:**  Similar to `gs`,  mocking `get_directory_names` isolates the test from external file systems.


3. **Clearer Test Function Names:**  Test names are more descriptive.

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `TypeError` exceptions.

5. **Fixture for Test Data:** The `mock_gs` fixture provides a way to control the environment for the tests.

6. **Comprehensive Tests:**  The provided tests now cover valid input, a dictionary-style input, and an invalid input case.  Critically, the tests now cover cases where the expected input is a string, but an incorrect type is passed.

7. **Error Handling:** Added tests to check for specific types of exceptions.

8. **Edge Cases:** Added a test to check for empty strings as input, which is an important edge case.

9. **Import Corrections:** The imports are fixed to resolve issues like `from src import gs`.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Replace the placeholder comments with the correct imports from your `src` directory.
3.  Create a `src/suppliers/aliexpress` directory structure. Place your `AliPromoCampaign` file in `src/suppliers/aliexpress`.  Ensure the modules (`src`, `src.utils`, etc.) and any files referenced by the code exist in the `src` directory structure.
4.  Run the tests from the directory containing your `test_ali_promo_campaign.py` file using `pytest test_ali_promo_campaign.py`.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **More Specific Error Handling:**  If the actual code has more nuanced error handling, add tests to cover those specific cases.
*   **Testing `products` Attribute:** Add tests for the `products` attribute if it is part of your class.
*   **Mock `AliAffiliatedProducts`:** If used in the code,  mock or stub this import to complete testing.
*   **Data-Driven Tests:** For repetitive tests, consider using data-driven tests for easier test management.
