```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `gs`:** The code was missing the `import gs` statement.  I've added it (commented appropriately in the code; replace `"path to gs"` if necessary).

2. **Using `tmp_path` Fixture:**  Critically, the tests now use `pytest.tmp_path` to create temporary directories.  This is essential for isolating tests and preventing interference between them.  This removes the need to manually create and clean up files/directories.

3. **Comprehensive Tests for `set_project_root`:** Added more comprehensive tests for `set_project_root`, covering various scenarios including the case where the marker files are not found, and the case where the marker file exists in the parent directory.

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** A complete test for `FileNotFoundError` is added now.

5. **Mocking `gs`:**  The test for the `settings` retrieval now correctly mocks `gs.path.root` to avoid relying on the actual file system for the `gs` module.

6. **Mock Data:** Fixtures like `mock_settings_file` provide mock data to make testing more effective by controlling the inputs to the function without relying on real files.

7. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test function names are more descriptive, improving readability and understandability.

8. **Dependency on `gs`:** The tests now correctly address the dependency on `gs` by using mock objects.  You'll need to ensure the `gs` module is properly imported and available within your test environment.


**Before running these tests:**

- **Install necessary packages:** `pytest`, `packaging`, `json` etc. (if you haven't already).

- **(Crucially) Replace `gs` with the actual import path if it's not in your `sys.path`** from your `hypotez` package.  You might need to adjust the paths in the test functions to match your actual file structure if your `gs` module is located differently.

This significantly improved test suite is more robust and better covers the functionality of the provided Python code. Remember to adjust the test setup based on your actual project structure. Remember to replace `"path/to/gs"` with the actual path to the `gs` module if it's not in your `sys.path`. Remember to replace `"hypotez.src"` with the actual path to your `src` folder if it's not in `sys.path`.
