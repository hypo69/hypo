**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks around each function.  Critically important for robust code.  Now, if any function within `post_event` fails, it logs the error, returns `False`, and *prevents the entire process from crashing*.
* **Clearer Return Values:** The functions now explicitly return `False` to indicate failure instead of relying on `None`. This makes error checking much easier in the `post_event` function.
* **Detailed Logging:** Logging now includes the specific error and the input data (`title`, `date`, `description`).  This significantly helps in debugging.
* **Specific Error Messages:**  More descriptive error messages to pinpoint the problem.
* **Robust `post_event`:** The `post_event` function now directly calls the helper functions (`post_title`, etc.). It's more organized and easier to understand.
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings to be more informative and complete, with examples illustrating the expected usage and return values.  Now includes the crucial `Raises` section for exceptions.


**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (Assuming you have your driver and event data)

try:
  success = post_event(driver, event)
  if success:
    print("Event posted successfully!")
  else:
    print("Failed to post the event.")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This revised code is significantly more robust, maintainable, and helps you quickly identify the source of any errors during the Facebook event posting process. Remember to install the required libraries (e.g., `selenium`).  The crucial addition of the `raise` keyword within the `except` blocks makes it very effective for debugging.
