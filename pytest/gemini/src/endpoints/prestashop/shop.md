**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `valid_credentials` and `invalid_credentials` fixtures to cleanly manage the credentials data.  This improves test organization.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Used `pytest.raises` with `match` to assert that the correct `ValueError` is raised with the expected message, following the Russian language error message format in the source code.  This makes debugging easier.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now cover different ways of initializing the class (using `credentials`, individual `api_domain` and `api_key` arguments, and credential overriding).
* **Robustness:** Added tests for missing `api_domain` and `api_key` to catch all necessary cases of failure.
* **Edge Cases:**  The example test cases now have a strong focus on edge cases regarding invalid and missing input values.
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings to explain the purpose of each test.
* **Illustrative Mock Test (commented out):**  Added a commented-out example of how to test if a specific method within `super().__init__` throws an error (using `mocker`).  This is important to thoroughly test potential exceptions arising from the `super()` call.  You would uncomment this and adapt it to the specific situation in the code you're testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_shop.py`) in the same directory as your `shop.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_shop.py`.

This enhanced test suite provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the `PrestaShopShop` class. Remember to adapt the error handling and matching to your specific expected exceptions. Remember to adjust the import statements if you haven't followed the project folder structure exactly. Importantly, if the `super().__init__` method in `PrestaShop` itself has error handling, those tests will need to be incorporated to the testing suite.
