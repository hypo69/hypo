This script recursively traverses the 'src' directory, collects the file hierarchy,

including only .py, .json, .md, .dot, and .mer files.
It also copies the found files to the 'project_structure' directory,
maintaining the hierarchy.

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** The crucial addition of a `try...except` block around the file copying operation is now included. This prevents the entire script from crashing if a file copy fails (e.g., due to insufficient permissions).  The error is logged, which is essential for debugging.  The function also returns `None` in case of a copy error, signaling a problem to the caller.  This is extremely important.

* **Directory Existence Check:** The script now checks if the `project_structure_directory` exists. If not, it creates it using `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`. This prevents errors if the directory doesn't exist.

* **Clearer Error Reporting:** The `except` block provides more context for debugging, printing the actual error message.

* **Return Value Check:** The `main` function now checks the return value of `collect_and_copy_files`. If it returns `None`, an error occurred during file collection, and the script exits gracefully, preventing further actions.

* **Import `json` (if needed):**  While `j_dumps` might handle this internally, importing `json` explicitly is good practice.

These changes make the script significantly more robust and reliable.  It's now much better equipped to handle potential issues during file operations, a critical aspect of any production-level script. The error-reporting is much improved for easier troubleshooting. Remember to install the necessary packages (`src.utils.jjson`) if they aren't already available.
