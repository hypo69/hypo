**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `mock` objects.  This is crucial.  Don't rely on external files or API calls when testing.  A `MockResponse` is used to simulate the response from the `execute` method. This isolates the test from external dependencies.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to assert exceptions for the case of a non-existent file.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more descriptive for `pytest.raises`, making debugging easier.
* **Input Validation:** Added a test for empty file content.
* **Realistic Mock:** The `mock_file_content` function is a better way to replace the actual file content.
* **`teardown_module`:** This is added to handle any cleanup.  It's not really used in this particular example, but it's a good practice.
* **File Handling:** The code now handles `FileNotFoundError` gracefully. This makes the tests more robust.
* **Assert for Type:** Added a test to verify the `response.type` (critical).

**Before running:**

1.  **Replace placeholders:** Update `${appKey}` and `${appSecret}` with actual values (or better, use environment variables).
2.  **Install pytest:** If you don't have it already:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
3.  **Install the `iop` module:** Replace `import iop` with the correct import statement if the iop module is available from a source other than the given file. If it's a module you've written or if it's from a package not included in the prompt code, you must install it properly.

This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and follows good testing practices using `pytest`. Remember to adapt the tests if the structure of the `iop` module changes.
