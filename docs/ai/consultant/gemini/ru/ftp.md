Code Review: `hypotez/src/utils/ftp.py`

**Overall:** The code is well-structured and follows good practices for error handling and logging.  However, there are some improvements that could enhance robustness and security.

**Strengths:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code includes `try...except` blocks to catch and log potential errors during FTP operations. This is crucial for preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.
* **Logging:** Uses a `logger` object, suggesting integration with a logging framework (e.g., `logging`). This is a good practice for tracking events.
* **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`typing.Union`, etc.) improves code readability and maintainability.
* **`finally` blocks for cleanup:** The `finally` blocks ensure that the FTP connection is closed regardless of whether the operation was successful.  This is extremely important.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Hardcoded credentials:** The FTP credentials (`_connection['user']`, `_connection['password']`) are hardcoded. This is a major security vulnerability.  Absolutely **do not** deploy code with hardcoded credentials.  Use environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management system.
* **Missing `ftplib.error_perm` handling:** The `except Exception as ex` blocks are too broad.  The `ftplib` module provides specific exceptions (`ftplib.error_perm`) that can be more informative for debugging specific permission or connection issues.
* **`source_file_path` argument redundancy in `delete`:** The `source_file_path` argument in the `delete` function is not used. This makes the function slightly less intuitive.
* **Potential for unexpected behavior with invalid paths:** The functions don't validate the input paths (`source_file_path`, `dest_dir`) to prevent issues like trying to access a non-existent file or directory, potentially leading to security risks.
* **Missing validation for file existence in `write`:** `write` assumes the file at `source_file_path` exists, without checking.  A `FileNotFoundError` could crash the program without logging or handling.
* **Lack of robust directory handling in `write`:** The code assumes that the `dest_dir` exists on the FTP server.  It doesn't attempt to create it if it doesn't exist.
* **`read` does not handle empty files:** If the remote file is empty, `f.read()` will return an empty byte string (`b''`).  The code should explicitly handle this case.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Move credentials to configuration:** Use environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `yaml`, `toml`) to store FTP credentials securely.  This is crucial.  Example using environment variables:

```python
import os
_connection = {
    'server': os.environ.get('FTP_SERVER', 'ftp.example.com'),
    'port': int(os.environ.get('FTP_PORT', 21)),
    'user': os.environ.get('FTP_USER', 'username'),
    'password': os.environ.get('FTP_PASSWORD', 'password')
}
```

2. **Handle specific FTP exceptions:**

```python
    try:
        ...
    except ftplib.error_perm as e:
        logger.error(f"FTP permission error: {e}")
        return False
    except ftplib.all_errors as e:  # Catches other errors
        logger.error(f"FTP error: {e}")
        return False
```

3. **Validate paths:** Implement checks to ensure that `source_file_path` exists and is a file, and that `dest_dir` is a valid directory.  Handle `FileNotFoundError`.

4. **Create destination directories:** Add code in `write` to create the `dest_dir` on the FTP server if it doesn't already exist.


5. **Handle empty file in `read`:**

```python
    try:
        ...
        content = f.read()
        if not content:
            logger.warning(f"Remote file '{dest_file_name}' is empty.")
        return content
    ...
```

6. **Remove redundant `source_file_path`:**  The `source_file_path` parameter is not used in the `delete` function.  Remove it.

7. **Check if file exists on the server in `delete`:** Implement a check to see if the file exists on the server before attempting to delete it.  This could prevent unnecessary error messages if the file doesn't exist.

By implementing these suggestions, the code will be significantly more robust, secure, and maintainable. Remember to choose a secure method for storing your FTP credentials, like environment variables or a configuration file. Also, consider using a more specialized library or framework for file transfers if possible (like `paramiko`, which provides more advanced FTP functionality and security options) instead of `ftplib` for more complex operations.
