How to use the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/bberyakov` module

This module provides classes for interacting with Google Spreadsheets using Python.  It leverages the Google Sheets API.

**Module Structure:**

The module contains the following classes:

* **`GSpreadsheet`:**  This class likely handles high-level interactions with a Google Spreadsheet document.  This might include methods for:
    * Opening a spreadsheet.
    * Creating a new spreadsheet.
    * Saving a spreadsheet.
    * Retrieving spreadsheet metadata (e.g., title, ID).
* **`GWorksheet`:**  This class presumably manages individual worksheets within a spreadsheet.  Potential methods might include:
    * Accessing data in a worksheet (potentially by row/column).
    * Writing data to a worksheet.
    * Formatting cells or ranges of cells (e.g., applying fonts, colors, borders).
    * Inserting/deleting rows or columns.
    * Managing named ranges.
* **`GSRenderr`:** This class is likely responsible for rendering spreadsheet data in some way, potentially for display or export.  More context is needed.


**How to Use:**

```python
# Example assuming you have installed the necessary libraries (e.g., the Google Sheets API client library).

from hypotez.src.goog.spreadsheet.bberyakov import GSpreadsheet, GWorksheet

# 1. Authenticate with your Google account. (This is essential and usually involves a service account or OAuth).
#  (Replace with your actual authentication logic.)
# Example (Illustrative â€“ replace with proper authentication):
# spreadsheet_id = "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"
# gspread_credentials = "YOUR_CREDENTIALS_FILE"
# spreadsheet_object = GSpreadsheet(spreadsheet_id, gspread_credentials)

# 2. Get a specific worksheet.  (Replace 'sheet_name' with the actual sheet name)
# worksheet = spreadsheet_object.get_worksheet('sheet_name')


# 3. Access/Modify data

# Access data (replace with appropriate row/column indices):
# cell_value = worksheet.get_cell_value(row_index, column_index)
# worksheet.set_cell_value(row_index, column_index, new_value)

# Example of accessing/modifying a range of cells:
# worksheet.set_range_value(row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end, data_list) # data_list is a list of lists
# data = worksheet.get_range_value(row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end) # retrieve list of list data


# Example of inserting a row
# worksheet.insert_row(row_index, new_row_data)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Authentication:** The provided example is incomplete. You must handle authentication properly for access to the Google Spreadsheet API.  This typically involves service accounts or user credentials.
* **Error Handling:** Add `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during API calls (e.g., incorrect authentication, invalid spreadsheet IDs, API errors).
* **Spreadsheet IDs:**  Replace `"YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"` with the actual ID of your Google Spreadsheet.
* **Libraries:** Ensure that the necessary libraries (e.g., the Google Sheets API client library) are installed.
* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely controls runtime behavior and may affect logging or other development-related aspects. Review the code for the module to understand its meaning.
* **`gspread_credentials`:** This is a placeholder for authentication details. The exact form of this depends on your chosen method (e.g., a file path to a service account key).

**Next Steps:**

To get more specific usage help, you need to provide code from the classes themselves (e.g., `GSpreadsheet`, `GWorksheet`, `GSRenderr`).  This will let me understand the exact methods and their parameters.
