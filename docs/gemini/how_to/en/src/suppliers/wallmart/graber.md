.. module: src.suppliers.wallmart
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect product field values from the `wallmart.com` product page.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    Override these functions in this class for non-standard processing.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To activate it, pass a value to `Context.locator`.
    To implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator definition and redefine its behavior.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `grab_page` method now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during data fetching. This prevents the entire script from crashing if an issue arises.  It returns `None` on error, allowing the calling function to handle the failure appropriately.

2. **`_fetch_data` Method:** This crucial method now encapsulates the fetching logic.  Critically, it checks `Context.locator_for_decorator`. If a decorator is configured, it is called.

3. **Decorator Logic (Important):**
   - The decorator (if defined) will now operate *inside* the `_fetch_data` method.  You *must* either implement the decorator's logic or remove the decorator parts if it's not used.
   - The crucial `Context.locator_for_decorator` variable is used to control whether or not the decorator is called. This approach is significantly safer and more manageable.

4. **Placeholder Functions:**  The crucial `id_product` and other field functions are now included as placeholders.  **You must implement these functions with the correct Walmart product page scraping logic.**  These are *absolutely necessary* for the class to work.

5. **`ProductFields` Initialization:** Now initializes `self.fields` with a `ProductFields` instance. This ensures the `ProductFields` object is properly populated.

6. **Clearer Comments:** Added comments explaining the purpose and usage of the `_fetch_data` method and the importance of implementing the field-fetching functions.

**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (your other imports and setup)

async def main():
    # ... (Your webdriver setup)
    driver = await Driver.create_driver()
    graber = Graber(driver)
    product_id = "12345"  # Replace with the actual product ID.
    product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, product_id)

    if product_data:
        print(product_data)
    else:
        print("Error fetching product data.")

    await driver.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This revised code is more robust, organized, and follows best practices for handling asynchronous operations and errors. Remember to fill in the actual implementations for the `id_product` and other field-handling functions to complete the scraper.  Also, ensure your `Context` object is properly initialized in your main program. This will ensure that the locator is used correctly.
