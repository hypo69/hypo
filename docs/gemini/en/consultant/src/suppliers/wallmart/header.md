# Changes Made

*   Added imports `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` and `from src.logger import logger`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for file reading.
*   Added detailed docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format to the `set_project_root` function and for all variables.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific terms.
*   Improved error handling using `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except` blocks.  Catches more specific errors for more informative logging.
*   Added type hints and validation to the `set_project_root` function.
*   Corrected the name of the `copyright` key to `copyrihgnt` in the variable assignment.
*   Used absolute paths (`(PROJECT_ROOT / 'src' / 'settings.json').absolute()`) for improved portability when loading from the root.
