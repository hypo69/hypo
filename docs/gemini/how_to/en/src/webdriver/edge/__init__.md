# Usage Guide for hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/__init__.py

This guide explains how to use the `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/__init__.py` module, which provides access to the Edge WebDriver.

## Module Description

The `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/__init__.py` module is a Python module that likely initializes and manages the Edge WebDriver.  It exports a single object, `Edge`, which presumably represents an instance of the Edge WebDriver.

## Key Concepts

* **`MODE = 'dev'`**: This variable likely defines the operational mode of the WebDriver setup.  `'dev'` suggests this is for a development environment.  Different modes might affect configuration, logging, or other aspects of the WebDriver's behavior.

## How to Use

The module provides a single import:

```python
from .edge import Edge
```

This import statement retrieves the `Edge` object.  Subsequent usage will involve interacting with the `Edge` instance.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.edge import Edge

# Initialize the Edge WebDriver
driver = Edge()

# ... (Perform actions with the driver, e.g., navigate to a URL, interact with elements) ...

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Dependencies:**  This code likely depends on the `selenium` library and potentially other libraries for Edge WebDriver interaction. Ensure that these dependencies are installed before using this module.
* **Driver Path:**  If you need to specify a custom path to the Edge WebDriver executable, this would likely be done within the `Edge` class definition. Check the code within the `.edge` module for implementation details.
* **Error Handling:**  Robust code should include error handling to catch exceptions during WebDriver initialization and operation.  The example above lacks error handling.

**Further Information:**

To fully understand how to use the `Edge` object and to see complete usage examples, examine the code within the `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/edge.py` file.  This `__init__.py` file merely provides access to the core functionality.

This guide provides a basic overview. For detailed use cases and specific options, refer to the documentation within the `.edge` module itself.
