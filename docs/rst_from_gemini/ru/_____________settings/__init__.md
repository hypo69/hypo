""" Project settings: passwords, server addresses, and other sensitive information.
Passwords are stored in a database in KeyPass format with a `.kdbx` extension.
To open the database, a master password is required.

Default Program Settings
The `ProjectSettings` class (`src.settings.global_settings.ProjectSettings`) defines key configuration parameters:
- A list of suppliers that will be executed if no other is specified
- Locale - the primary language for collecting information from suppliers
- Passwords, logins, and server addresses for external connections
- Internal project paths

The class is called as a singleton instance `gs`:
```python
from header import gs
"""
...

from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__,  __doc__, __details__

from .credentials import gs
from .header import __root__

```

**Explanation of Changes and Potential Improvements:**

1. **Corrected Module Name:**  The original code had `_____________settings`, which is incorrect. The corrected code uses `settings` as the module name, which makes more sense based on the contents.

2. **Clarity and Consistency:** Improved the docstring by removing unnecessary repetition of the `MODE` definition.  The explanation is now more focused on the role of the `settings` module itself.

3. **Correct Class Name:** Changed `ProjectSetting` to `ProjectSettings` in the docstring and code example.  Python class names are usually capitalized.  This is a crucial detail for understanding the structure.

4. **Missing Information:** The docstring mentions a `ProjectSettings` class but doesn't specify *where* it's defined.  The corrected docstring clarifies that the class is in `src.settings.global_settings`.  This is essential for anyone wanting to use or extend the settings.

5. **Code Structure:**  This is a module (`__init__.py`) for a *package*.  The `from .credentials import gs` and `from .header import __root__` statements imply that the `credentials` and `header` modules are likely within the `src.settings` package.


**Recommendations for Further Improvement:**

* **Detailed Docstring for `ProjectSettings`:**  Add a more detailed docstring to the `ProjectSettings` class itself, describing the attributes (e.g., `suppliers`, `locale`, `external_connections`).  This is vital for users to understand how to interact with the class.

* **Explicit Imports:** Instead of `from header import gs`, use a more specific path or a function/class import, clarifying how `gs` is created/used, e.g., `from .global_settings import ProjectSettings as gs` or `from .global_settings import get_global_settings`.  This way, other developers know how to correctly access the settings.

* **Error Handling:** If the `credentials` module depends on a file (e.g., the KeyPass database), mention potential error handling in the docstrings.

* **Security Considerations:**  Storing passwords in clear text (even in a database) is very dangerous.  If possible, use proper cryptographic techniques for securely storing sensitive data, like hashing and salting passwords.

By addressing these points, you can make the code more maintainable, readable, and secure.  You will also increase your confidence in this part of the system.
