# hypotez/src/suppliers/gearbest/header.py

## Overview

This module provides utility functions for setting the project root directory and loading settings from a JSON file. It also handles potential errors during file loading and provides access to project metadata like name, version, documentation, and author information.

## Table of Contents

- [set_project_root](#set_project_root)
- [Project Metadata](#project-metadata)


## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: This function locates the root directory of the project by searching upwards from the current file's location for specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If any of these marker files are present in a parent directory, it sets the project root and adds that directory to `sys.path`.  If no matching directory is found, it defaults to the current directory.

**Parameters**:

- `marker_files` (tuple): A tuple of filenames or directory names to search for. Defaults to a tuple containing `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Returns**:

- `Path`: The path to the project root directory.

**Raises**:

- None


### Project Metadata

**Description**: This section describes the code that retrieves and stores project metadata.

**Variables**:


- `__root__`: (Path) Stores the root directory of the project. This variable is assigned by the `set_project_root` function.

- `settings`: (dict) Stores the project settings loaded from `settings.json`. If the file is not found or the content is not valid JSON, `settings` defaults to `None`.


- `__project_name__`: (str) Retrieves the "project_name" from the `settings` dictionary; defaults to 'hypotez' if the key doesn't exist or `settings` is `None`.

- `__version__`: (str) Retrieves the "version" from the `settings` dictionary; defaults to an empty string if the key doesn't exist or `settings` is `None`.

- `__doc__`: (str) Stores the project documentation from the `README.MD` file; defaults to an empty string if not found.

- `__details__`: (str) Stores the details of the project; defaults to an empty string.

- `__author__`: (str) Retrieves the "author" from the `settings` dictionary; defaults to an empty string if the key doesn't exist or `settings` is `None`.

- `__copyright__`: (str) Retrieves the "copyrihgnt" from the `settings` dictionary; defaults to an empty string if the key doesn't exist or `settings` is `None`.

- `__cofee__`: (str) Retrieves the "cofee" from the `settings` dictionary; defaults to a cup of coffee link if the key doesn't exist or `settings` is `None`.
