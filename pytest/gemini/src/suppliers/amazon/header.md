**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `gs` module and `settings.json` file. This is crucial because `gs` and `settings.json` are external dependencies that these tests need to control.  This way, the tests don't rely on external files existing.
2. **Error Handling:**  The `test_settings_json_loading_failure` demonStartes how to test for `FileNotFoundError` using `pytest.raises`.
3. **File Creation/Deletion:** The tests now create and delete temporary files and directories to ensure that they don't interfere with other tests or the file system. This is extremely important for avoiding test flakiness.
4. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests use more explicit assertions (`assert actual_root == expected_root`) for easier debugging and verification.
5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover valid input, cases where the marker file is in a parent directory, no marker files found, and non-existent file cases.
6. **`set_project_root` function test:**  Tests for the scenario where the file exists but isn't in `sys.path` when the file is in the current directory.
7. **`sys.path` modification:** The tests for `sys.path` modification are now more robust and handle the case where the file might already be in `sys.path`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs` Module:**  The code depends on a `gs` module (which is likely part of your project). Make sure you have a valid implementation of the `gs` module, or a proper mock for it, for these tests to run.  If possible, create a separate test file for the `gs` module to make the tests more manageable.
* **`settings.json`:** The tests create and delete the `settings.json` file; **this will not be appropriate in a real project**. Replace this with a way to load the settings from an environment variable or a known configuration file.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the test code as `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
2. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved test suite is more robust and comprehensive, dealing with edge cases and exceptions while isolating the tested function's behavior, which is essential for writing reliable and maintainable code. Remember to replace the mock data (`mock_settings`) with actual data for a real-world test case. Remember to adjust the path if you are not in the root of the project.
