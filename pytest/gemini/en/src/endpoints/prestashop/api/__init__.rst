**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Modules:**  The code now imports `pytest` and the `PrestaShop` class.

2. **Placeholder Tests:**  The example tests (`test_prestashop_method_valid_input`, etc.) are placeholders.  **You MUST replace** these placeholders with tests that actually call methods from your `PrestaShop` class and assert expected results.  This is the most important part.

3. **Exception Handling:** The code now uses `pytest.raises` to test exception handling and checks that the expected error messages are present in the caught exception. This is a critical part of robust testing.

4. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test names and docstrings are more descriptive to improve readability.

5. **Example with `pytest.raises`:**  A commented-out example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test specific exception types.

6. **Error Handling with `try-except`:** The code now uses `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during test execution and provide more informative error messages, preventing tests from failing silently.

7. **Robustness:** The tests are now structured to be more robust, checking for both valid inputs and various types of invalid or unexpected inputs.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the example method names, expected values, and exception types with the actual ones from your `PrestaShop` class.
2. **Run Tests:**  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_prestashop.py`) and run it using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest test_prestashop.py
```


This revised answer provides a much more comprehensive and practical framework for testing your `PrestaShop` class. Remember to adapt these tests to precisely match the API of your PrestaShop class.  The crucial part of the answer is the *examples* of how to use `pytest`, `pytest.raises`, and *exception handling*. Remember to add more tests as needed to cover various scenarios.  Finally, don't forget to verify the code in `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/__init__.py` that's expected to be tested.
