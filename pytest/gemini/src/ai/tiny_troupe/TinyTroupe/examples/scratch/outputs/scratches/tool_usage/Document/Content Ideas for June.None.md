**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hypothetical Function:** The provided input code didn't contain any Python code to test.  This example demonstrates testing a hypothetical `analyze_content_ideas` function that takes a dictionary of content ideas.  **Replace this with your actual code.**

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The example now includes tests for valid input, invalid input types (not a dictionary), invalid idea types, and missing details.  Critically, it uses `pytest.raises` to specifically check for the expected exceptions, making the tests more robust.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names are descriptive and clearly indicate what is being tested.

4. **Isolation:** Each test function is independent and doesn't rely on the state of other tests.

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** The example now demonstrates how to test cases that result in expected errors, essential for robust tests.


**How to Use with Your Code:**

1. **Replace Placeholder Function:** Substitute the example `analyze_content_ideas` function with the actual function you want to test from your provided Python file.
2. **Adapt Tests:** Modify the test cases to match the structure and expected behavior of your function. This includes the input types, expected outputs, and possible error conditions.
3. **Run Tests:** Save the Python code (including your function and the test cases) in a file (e.g., `test_content_ideas.py`), and run `pytest test_content_ideas.py` from your terminal.


This improved example provides a solid foundation for writing effective `pytest` tests for your Python code. Remember to adapt the tests to precisely match your function's requirements and include thorough checks for valid and invalid scenarios. Remember to add more tests related to the specific functionality if your code is more complex.
