```

## Changes Made

- Added missing imports `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` and `from src.logger import logger`.
- Rewrote the module docstring in reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Added a `prepare_all_campaigns` function with a docstring in RST format.
- Added a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during campaign preparation and log them using `logger.error`.
- Replaced the example `# ...` with more detailed comments that describe the expected data loading and campaign processing steps and the use of `j_loads`.
- Removed the unused `MODE` variable.
- Corrected the file synopsis to better explain the purpose of the module.
- Removed incorrect shebang lines as the venv handling is already covered by the importing of the `header`.
