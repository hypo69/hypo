How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a variable `MODE` and sets its value to 'dev'.  It also contains numerous multiline strings (docstrings) that appear to be used for documentation purposes, but they don't contain executable logic.  These docstrings are likely for use with tools like Sphinx to generate documentation.  The code itself is a Python file, potentially part of a larger project related to eBay supplier interactions.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. A variable named `MODE` is assigned the string value 'dev'.
2. Multiline strings (docstrings) are present, providing context and documentation about the file and its purpose, but they don't directly perform any actions.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No executable code was found for demonstration in the provided snippet.
    # To demonstrate usage, you would need the code that utilizes the MODE variable.
    # For example, you might have a section in your code that conditionally uses the 'dev' or 'prod' mode,
    # which would be in a different file than this one.

    # Example of hypothetical usage (not present in the provided code):
    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
    else:
        print("Running in production mode.")
