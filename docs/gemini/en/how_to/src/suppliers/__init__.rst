How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py` module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module (`hypotez/src/suppliers/__init__.py`) defines the structure for interacting with different data suppliers.  It establishes a `Supplier` class as a base for various supplier-specific implementations.  It details how to extend the `Supplier` class with supplier-specific methods and the directory structure for these methods. The module outlines the relationships between the `Supplier`, `Driver`, and `Product` entities.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Define a Supplier Class:** Create a new class that inherits from the `Supplier` base class (if one exists).
2. **Implement Supplier-Specific Methods:** Implement functions within the newly defined class that handle data extraction from the specific supplier. These methods will be linked through the `supplier.related_functions` interface.
3. **Structure Supplier-Specific Functions:**  Place these methods (supplier-specific logic) within a directory matching the `supplier_prefix` (e.g., `amazon`, `aliexpress`).
4. **Define `supplier_prefix`:**  The `supplier_prefix` determines the directory where the supplier-specific functions reside.  This is typically a short, abbreviated name associated with the supplier's name or website.
5. **Establish Relationships:**  The module describes the relationship between a `Supplier`, a `Driver`, and a `Product`, visualized in the `supplier-warehouse-client.png` image.
6. **Configure Mode:**  Set the `MODE` variable to a specific value (e.g., `'dev'` or `'prod'`) within the script.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example of a hypothetical Supplier class (within a 'amazon' directory)
    # Assuming `supplier.related_functions` is defined elsewhere:

    from .supplier import Supplier  # Assuming this is imported somewhere
    import supplier #Import supplier functions

    class AmazonSupplier(Supplier):

        def get_product_data(self, product_id):
            # Implement logic to fetch product data from Amazon based on 'product_id'
            # This function would utilize appropriate libraries and the supplier interface
            # for Amazon-specific data retrieval logic
            return {"title": "Example Amazon Product", "price": 99.99}
