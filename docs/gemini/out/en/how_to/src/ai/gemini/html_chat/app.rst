How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a FastAPI application for a chat interface, likely integrating with a large language model (LLM) like Kazarinov. It handles user input, sends it to the LLM, and displays the response in a web page.  The code also includes functionality for loading questions from a file and randomly selecting questions if a specific input is provided.  It uses Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML and mounts static files (like CSS) for the webpage.  The application is designed to run on a local development server and opens a web browser automatically.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports libraries like `fastapi`, `Jinja2Templates`, `StaticFiles`, `pydantic`, `kazanov`, `random`, `pathlib`, and others for web framework functionality, template rendering, static file serving, data validation, the LLM, random selection, file paths, and more.


2. **Initialize FastAPI application and templates:**  It creates a FastAPI application object (`app`) and sets up Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML, specifying the location of template files.  It also mounts static files (e.g., CSS) for styling the web page.

3. **Initialize the LLM (Kazarinov):**  It initializes an instance of the `Kazarinov` class, likely the LLM implementation. The `system_instruction`, and the `generation_config` are defined, and important for the LLM functionality.


4. **Load questions from files:** The code loads a list of questions from files located in a specified directory (`gs.path.google_drive / 'kazarinov' / 'prompts' / 'q'`) within the `questions_list` variable.

5. **Define the `Question` model:** It defines a Pydantic `BaseModel` called `Question` to validate user input (the question).

6. **Define the chat endpoints (`/` and `/ask`):**
    - The `/` endpoint renders the initial chat page (likely containing an input form for user questions), using the Jinja2 template `chat.html` .
    - The `/ask` endpoint processes the user question.  It checks if the user input is "--next". If so, it loads a random question from the pre-loaded `questions_list` and processes that instead.  The user's question or randomly selected question is sent to the LLM (`Kazarinov`) for processing, and the response is then returned to the front end, formatted as expected for the `chat.html` template.


7. **Open the browser automatically:**  A function (`open_browser`) is defined to open a web browser automatically at the specified address.

8. **Run the application:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block starts the application using `uvicorn`. It also launches the browser in a separate thread for a more user-friendly experience.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage in a client application (not part of the code block)
    import requests
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class Question(BaseModel):
        question: str

    # Replace with your actual API endpoint
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask"

    question_data = Question(question="What is the capital of France?")

    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=question_data.dict())
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        # Process the response content, like displaying it.
        print(response.json()) # Assuming the response returns a JSON format
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
