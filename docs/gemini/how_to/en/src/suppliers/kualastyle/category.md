"""  Module for collecting product data from the hb.co.il supplier's category pages via webdriver.
Each supplier has its own category processing logic.

- Fetches a list of categories from the seller's pages. `get_list_categories_from_site()`.
  @todo Implement a check for category changes on the seller's pages.
  The seller might add new categories, rename or delete/hide existing ones.
  A crucial task is to maintain a table mapping `PrestaShop.categories <-> aliexpress.shop.categories`.
- Retrieves a list of products from a category page. `get_list_products_in_category()`.
- Iterates through the product list, delegating each product URL to the `grab_product_page()` function.
- `grab_product_page()` processes product details and delegates further processing to the `Product` class.

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during page loading, locator execution, and pagination.  Crucially, it returns `None` if no product links are found, avoiding unexpected behavior. This is essential for robust code.
* **Pagination:** Improved the `paginator` function and the way product links are fetched and appended. It now handles the case where a next page exists correctly. It also logs informative messages.
* **Robustness:** Corrected the type hinting to reflect the possibility of `None` return values and made the logic for handling product links more robust to edge cases.
* **Explicit Logging:** Added `logger.warning` messages to make the program's behavior more understandable and to signal missing or error conditions in a clear way.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Changed `list_products_in_category` to the more descriptive `product_links`.
* **Clarity:** Added comments to clarify the purpose of different parts of the code.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Instantiate a `Supplier` object:**  Make sure you have a `Supplier` object initialized with the appropriate driver and locators for the specific website.
2.  **Call `get_list_products_in_category`:**  Pass your `Supplier` object to the function.
3. **Handle the Return Value:** The function returns a list of product URLs or `None` if no product links are found.  You must check for `None` before trying to use the result.


```python
# Example Usage (assuming you have a Supplier object called 'supplier'):
product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier)
if product_urls:
    for url in product_urls:
        # Process each product URL
        ...
else:
    print("No product URLs found.")

```


This revised code is significantly more robust and user-friendly, making it easier to integrate into your larger application. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the actual locators and other relevant information for the Kualastyle website. Remember to correctly implement the `grab_product_page` and `Product` class.
