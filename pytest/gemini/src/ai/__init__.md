# test for different types of prompts, error handling on invalid API keys,
# and more comprehensive edge case testing.

# and to adapt the tests according to the specific API's and expected behavior
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly indicate the input type (e.g., `test_google_generate_text_invalid_prompt`).

2. **Specific Assertions:** The tests now use `assert isinstance(result, str)` to verify the type of the returned value.  Crucially, `assert len(result) > 0` checks for non-empty strings to avoid a common failure mode.

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  The tests now include `pytest.raises` for verifying specific exception types and messages.

4. **Placeholder Comments:** The tests now have detailed comments explaining their purpose and including examples of how to modify them.   The tests now specify expected errors which are critical for robust tests.

5. **Edge Cases:** The examples now include tests for edge cases like empty strings and long prompts.

6. **Robustness:** Tests check for empty or invalid results from both classes to avoid potential issues with the API interaction or incorrect implementation.


**How to use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Update `GoogleGenerativeAI` and `OpenAIModel` with your actual classes and methods.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., `openai` for OpenAIModel).

2. **Run Tests:**  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_ai.py`) and run `pytest test_ai.py` from your terminal.

3. **Expand Tests:** Add more test cases based on the specifics of your classes. For example, if your `generate_text` method has parameters for temperature or max_tokens, add tests covering those parameters.  Include tests for invalid input types, and  error handling.


This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive testing framework for your AI modules. Remember to adapt the tests according to your specific API requirements and expected behaviors. Remember to also implement the `GoogleGenerativeAI` and `OpenAIModel` in your actual `.py` file for the tests to execute without errors.  For example, to use OpenAI, you would need to install the `openai` package (`pip install openai`).
