**Changes Made**

- Added type hints to the `__init__` method for `language` and `currency` parameters, as well as to the `product_id` parameter in `delete_product`.  Defaults `EN` and `USD` added to constructor.
- Added a `ValueError` exception to the `__init__` method.
- Improved docstrings for clarity using RST. Added more details to docstrings regarding parameters and return values. Renamed a few parameters to match other functions.
- Changed `campaign_file` to optional `campaign_name` and `campaign_file` for constructor, and specified types. Fixed exception that could be thrown when neither `campaign_name` nor `campaign_file` are provided.
- Replaced occurrences of `Optional[str | dict]` with `Optional[str]`. 
- Updated docstrings, corrected the `delete_product` method implementation to handle both paths, added a `try...except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` gracefully in the `delete_product` function.
- Included `exc_info` parameter to `delete_product` for better error logging.
- Added docstrings to all methods in RST format.
- Added logger usage to `delete_product` for logging errors and success.
