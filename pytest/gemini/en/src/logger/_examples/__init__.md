**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the aspect being tested (e.g., `test_version_type`, `test_docstring_not_empty`).

2. **Specific Assertion Types:**  Using `isinstance` is crucial for validating the type of returned values, as the original example was missing checks.


3. **Edge Case/Boundary Condition Testing (Implicit):**  The code itself doesn't involve complex logic that requires explicit boundary condition tests.


4. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):** Included a test (`test_invalid_version_format`) that uses `pytest.raises` to verify that an exception is raised when an invalid version string is passed to the `Version` constructor. This is a vital aspect of robust testing for functions that might encounter unexpected input.

5. **Docstrings:** Tests have been given descriptive docstrings to explain their purpose.

6. **Import Statements:** All necessary imports are included at the beginning of the test file.

7. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `MODE`â€”ensuring that all the declared elements are correctly defined and accessible.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_logger_examples.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger_examples.py`.


This revised test suite is more complete and demonstrates better testing practices, considering various aspects of function behavior and potential issues. Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`...`) with the actual code from `hypotez/src/logger/_examples/__init__.py` if available to fully test that code. Remember to add necessary fixtures if your code depends on them.
