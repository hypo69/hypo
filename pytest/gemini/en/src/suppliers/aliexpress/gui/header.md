**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial change is mocking `os.getcwd()`.  This isolates the test from the actual file system.  We also mock `sys.path.append` by saving the original state and restoring it afterwards.  This prevents unintended side effects.

2. **Clear Test Cases:** Test cases are now more specific and cover both expected and problematic cases.

3. **Edge Cases:** `test_root_path_calculation_no_hypotez` and `test_root_path_calculation_empty_path` handle scenarios where "hypotez" isn't in the path or the path is empty, which are important edge cases.

4. **Robustness:** The test setup ensures the original `sys.path` is restored after the test, maintaining the integrity of the Python environment for subsequent tests.

5. **Error Handling:**  The tests now explicitly assert for an empty string or a suitable default when 'hypotez' is not found, providing more comprehensive coverage.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This revised solution is significantly more robust and accurate in testing the `__root__` calculation, addressing potential errors and edge cases, making it suitable for real-world use. Remember to replace `"full/path/to/hypotez/some/other/folder"` with a suitable placeholder or an appropriate way to retrieve the actual path during testing.
