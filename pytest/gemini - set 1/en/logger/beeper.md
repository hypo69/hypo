**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `winsound.Beep`:** The `mock_winsound_beep` fixture now properly mocks the `winsound.Beep` function, allowing for more realistic and controlled testing without relying on external sound output.
* **Exception Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` to test exceptions like `AttributeError` and `ValueError` in more robust ways, and checking if the exception message matches what is expected to be printed.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now use more specific assertions. For example, `mock_winsound_beep.assert_called()` verifies that the mock function was called at least once.
* **Comprehensive Parameterization:**  Added `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different `BeepLevel` values, and `melody` values for the different levels.
* **Silent Mode Test:** A complete test for the `silent_mode` decorator ensuring it works as expected, both when silent mode is on and off.
* **Detailed Error Handling Test:** Includes an example of how to properly test exception handling when mocking a specific function call failure, verifying the output message is produced correctly.
* **More Comprehensive Level Tests**: Includes tests for various BeepLevels (SUCCESS, INFO, WARNING), demonstrating how to properly test different melodies for different events.
* **String-Level Test:** A test is included specifically to confirm that a string 'success' value works correctly.
* **Docstrings:**  Added more thorough docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of each test function.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_beeper.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_beeper.py
    ```

This improved test suite is more robust, covering a wider range of scenarios, and provides better feedback in case of failures. Remember to adapt the test cases based on the specific requirements and expected behavior of your code. For more thorough testing of edge cases and invalid inputs, consider adding more `@pytest.mark.parametrize` tests to evaluate scenarios not explicitly covered in this example.
