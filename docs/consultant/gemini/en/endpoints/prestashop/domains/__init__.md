**Changes Made**

- Added import statement `from src.logger import logger` for error handling.
- Added a more descriptive docstring for the module.
- Added TODO items for potential future functions and imports.
- Changed variable name `MODE` to a more descriptive format.  This is now consistent with Python coding standards and allows better understanding of the variable's purpose.
- Added comments to better explain the purpose of the code and the potential need for additional functions/imports.
