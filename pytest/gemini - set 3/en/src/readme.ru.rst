**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided input code is a markdown file describing modules.  There's no Python code to test.  Therefore, the above example tests are illustrative.  To write effective tests, you must first have actual Python functions, classes, or methods defined.

**How to proceed with testing:**

1. **Extract the Python code:**  If you have Python functions or classes in your actual files, copy/paste that here as the `input_code`.
2. **Identify functions/methods/classes to test:**  Determine what parts of the code need testing (e.g., functions to calculate something, methods to manipulate data, classes that perform actions).
3. **Design test cases:**  For each function, consider:
    * **Valid input:**  Standard, expected cases.
    * **Invalid/unexpected input:** Cases with incorrect types, values outside expected ranges, etc.  
    * **Edge cases:** Values at the boundaries of input ranges or special conditions.
    * **Error handling:**  Test if the code raises the correct exceptions in error conditions, using `pytest.raises`.
4. **Use `pytest` syntax:** Structure the tests following the example format, using `assert` statements to check expected outcomes.
5. **Use fixtures if needed:** Define fixtures to provide data that multiple tests need without repeating setup code.
6. **Thorough documentation:** Document each test case with clear docstrings explaining the test's purpose and the scenario being tested.


**Crucially:** The provided Markdown file has no executable Python code, so testing is not possible without that code.  Please provide the actual Python code for a useful test suite.
