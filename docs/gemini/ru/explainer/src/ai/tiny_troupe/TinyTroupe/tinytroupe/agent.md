This module provides the main classes and functions for TinyTroupe's  agents.

Agents are the key abstraction used in TinyTroupe. An agent is a simulated person or entity that can interact with other agents and the environment, by
receiving stimuli and producing actions. Agents have cognitive states, which are updated as they interact with the environment and other agents. 
Agents can also store and retrieve information from memory, and can perform actions in the environment. Different from agents whose objective is to
provide support for AI-based assistants or other such productivity tools, **TinyTroupe agents are aim at representing human-like behavior**, which includes
idiossincracies, emotions, and other human-like traits, that one would not expect from a productivity tool.

The overall underlying design is inspired mainly by cognitive psychology, which is why agents have various internal cognitive states, such as attention, emotions, and goals.
It is also why agent memory, differently from other LLM-based agent platforms, has subtle internal divisions, notably between episodic and semantic memory. 
Some behaviorist concepts are also present, such as the idea of a "stimulus" and "response" in the `listen` and `act` methods, which are key abstractions
to understand how agents interact with the environment and other agents.

# <algorithm>

The code defines a class `TinyPerson` representing an agent.  The algorithm for `TinyPerson` involves these steps:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` and `_post_init`):**
    * Takes optional arguments for memory and mental faculties.
    * Sets default values for attributes like `current_messages`, `environment`, `_actions_buffer`, `_accessible_agents`, etc.
    * Loads the agent configuration from a Mustache template.
    * Initializes the agent's initial system message.
    * Adds the agent to the global list of agents (`TinyPerson.all_agents`).
    * Resets the prompt (`reset_prompt`) for interactions.
    * Handles simulation context if available.

2. **Prompt Generation (`generate_agent_prompt`):**
    * Reads the agent prompt template.
    * Creates a copy of the agent's configuration.
    * Adds prompts for mental faculties.
    * Includes RAI prompts if enabled.
    * Renders the template using the configuration and mental faculty prompts.

3. **Prompt Reset (`reset_prompt`):**
    * Generates the agent prompt.
    * Sets up initial messages for the agent interaction.
    * Retrieves recent messages from episodic memory.

4. **Configuration Management (`define`, `define_several`, `define_relationships`, `clear_relationships`, `related_to`):**
    * Defines values in the agent's configuration, either directly or into a group.
    * Defines or updates relationships with other agents.
    * Clears relationships.
    * Defines relationships between the current agent and another.  

5. **Action and Interaction (`act`, `listen`, `see`, `think`, `internalize_goal`):**
    * Acts in the environment, optionally until done or for a fixed number of steps.
    * Produces messages (`_produce_message`).
    * Stores messages in episodic memory.
    * Updates cognitive state based on the action output.
    * Processes action through mental faculties.
    * Displays communication, optionally in a simplified form.
    * Listens to others, stores and processes stimuli from the environment.

6. **IO (`save_spec`, `load_spec`, `encode_complete_state`, `decode_complete_state`, `create_new_agent_from_current_spec`):**
    * Saves the agent's configuration to a JSON file.
    * Loads a JSON agent specification.
    * Encodes the agent's complete state for serialization.
    * Decodes and restores the agent state.
    * Creates a new agent from an existing spec, with a unique name.
    * Global agent management (`add_agent`, `has_agent`, `get_agent_by_name`, `clear_agents`).

7. **Display and Communication (`_display_communication`, `pop_and_display_latest_communications`, `clear_communications_buffer`)**:  Manages the display of agent interactions, including rich text formatting through the `rich` library.   The agent communicates with the environment if it exists, otherwise directly with the user.

# <explanation>

* **Imports:**
    * `os`, `csv`, `json`, `ast`, `textwrap`, `datetime`, `chevron`, `logging`: Standard Python libraries for file handling, data serialization, string formatting, date/time, templating, and logging.
    * `tinytroupe.utils`, `tinytroupe.control`: Custom modules from the `tinytroupe` package, providing utility functions (e.g., configuration reading, transaction management) and control mechanisms.
    * `rich`: A library for rich text output, enabling colorful and formatted agent interactions (important for user experience).
    * `copy`: For deep copying objects, crucial for serialization and creating new agents from existing configurations without modifying the original.
    * `JsonSerializableRegistry`:  Base class to support JSON serialization/deserialization of objects.
    * `typing`: Types for improved code readability and maintainability.

* **Classes:**
    * `TinyPerson`: The core agent class, containing methods to interact with the environment, other agents, and perform actions.  Its attributes include memory (`episodic_memory`, `semantic_memory`), cognitive state, actions buffer, accessible agents, configuration, and mental faculties.  The `@post_init` decorator ensures `_post_init` is called after `__init__`.
    * `TinyMentalFaculty`: Base class for all mental faculties, defining common attributes and abstract methods for processing actions. It facilitates a flexible design for adding new faculties.
    * `RecallFaculty`, `FilesAndWebGroundingFaculty`, `TinyToolUse`: Specific mental faculties, providing capabilities for recalling information, accessing files/webpages, and using tools, respectively.  Subclasses implement specific action processing, prompt generation, etc. These are crucial for the agent's cognitive abilities.
    * `TinyMemory`, `EpisodicMemory`, `SemanticMemory`: Represent different memory types. `EpisodicMemory` stores recent interactions; `SemanticMemory` utilizes `llama_index` to retrieve information from documents/webpages.


* **Functions:**
    * `generate_agent_prompt`, `reset_prompt`, `define`, `define_relationships`, `act`, `listen`, `see`, `think`, `internalize_goal`, `save_spec`, `load_spec`, `encode_complete_state`, `decode_complete_state`, `create_new_agent_from_current_spec`:  These functions implement various agent behaviors, configuration management, memory interaction, and communication with other agents. `@transactional` decorator suggests atomicity of these operations in control contexts, possibly within the larger simulation.
    * Crucial helper methods like `_produce_message`, `_update_cognitive_state`, and `_display_communication` encapsulate internal processing, facilitating cleaner interaction flow and modularity.

* **Variables:**
    * `config`: Global configuration from `utils.read_config_file()`.  This is critical for accessing external configuration files and parameters from various sources, particularly for external libraries like OpenAI.
    * `default`: Default parameter values, pulled from the config.
    * `llmaindex_openai_embed_model`, `Settings.embed_model`: Configuration elements used in integrating with `llama_index`.  This is important for grounding the agent in document knowledge.


* **Possible Errors/Improvements:**
    * The code relies on external libraries like `llama_index`, `OpenAI`, and `rich`.  Errors could arise from issues with those libraries (network problems, API errors, etc.).  Robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) is encouraged to manage possible exceptions, especially when interacting with external APIs or potentially unreliable data sources (e.g., external websites, files).

* **Relationships with other parts of the project:**
    * The `TinyPerson` class heavily depends on the `tinytroupe.utils` and `tinytroupe.control` modules, as well as external libraries (`llama_index`, `OpenAI`).
    * The structure suggests the existence of `EpisodicMemory`, `SemanticMemory`, and other mental faculties that define the agent's behavior and interaction capabilities.


**In summary:** This code implements a sophisticated agent class (`TinyPerson`) designed for human-like behavior simulation within a TinyTroupe environment. It's modular, handles memory effectively, integrates with external knowledge sources (via `llama_index`), and employs rich text formatting. Robust error handling and clear modularity are key aspects of its design.  The code is well-commented and explains its design choices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
