```python
import pytest

# No Python code provided in the input.  
# Therefore, no tests can be written.
#  
# If you provide the Python code corresponding to the JavaScript, 
# I can generate appropriate test cases.
#
#  For example, if the JavaScript code were part of a larger Python
#  project that interacts with a browser or web driver, the tests
#  could involve:
#
#   - Checking that the JavaScript function is called correctly.
#   - Verifying that the JavaScript function returns expected values for
#     different input scenarios.
#   - Testing the behavior of the JavaScript function within the 
#     context of a larger web automation scenario.
#
#  Without the Python code, it's impossible to write realistic and 
#  useful tests.
