```
Changes Made
```
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for data loading.
- Added error handling using `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, logging errors using `logger.error`.  This is preferable to using `...` for handling errors.
- Removed unnecessary `__root__` variable.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Renamed `settings_file` to `settings_file_path` for better clarity.
- Renamed `__root__` to `project_root` for better readability and consistency.
- Improved variable naming for better clarity (e.g., `current_path` to `project_root`).
- Added detailed docstrings (RST format) to functions and variables for better documentation.
- Improved error handling: Now the code logs errors to the logger if settings.json or README.MD isn't found or if there's a JSON decoding issue, instead of silently skipping them.  It now also handles the case where settings is not found.
- Used more descriptive variable names for improved code readability.
- Corrected typos in variable names (e.g., "copyrihgnt" to "copyright").
