**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `logger`:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `logger`. This is essential because `logger.error` and `logger.debug` are side effects that we don't want to happen during the tests.  This prevents any actual logging to the console or file.

2. **Specific Assertion for `mock_logger`:**  The test `test_custom_exception_logging` now checks if `mock_logger.error` was called with the expected message.  Similarly, `test_custom_exception_with_original_exception` verifies both `error` and `debug` calls.  This is much more robust than simply asserting the exception was raised.

3. **`test_invalid_input_custom_exception`:** This demonstrates a test for invalid input (passing a non-string message).  This is important for robustness.

4. **Comprehensive Exception Coverage:** Tests have been added for `FileNotFoundError`, `ProductFieldException`, and a simple example `PrestaShopException`.


5. **Example for `KeePassException`:** Shows the basic structure to test another custom exception class.


**Next Steps:**

- **More Specific Tests for Custom Exceptions:** Add more tests for each exception type, covering different scenarios of their use.
    - Include cases with specific error messages.
    - Examine how different types of exceptions are handled by inheritance (e.g., `PrestaShopException` vs. `Exception`).
- **Edge Cases:** Add tests to cover edge cases (empty strings, None values) for parameters and possible scenarios that could arise in each class.
- **Integration Tests (if applicable):** If these exceptions are used within a larger context, consider creating integration tests that exercise the use of these exceptions in specific functions within the application.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the detailed test cases for each individual exception class to thoroughly cover all the functionality and possible error states.


This improved solution is significantly more effective at verifying the exception handling logic of the given Python code while using the pytest framework properly. Remember to adapt the tests to match your specific needs and the intricacies of the application. Remember to add similar tests for other exception classes and scenarios.
