**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder for Actual Code:** The solution now correctly acknowledges the lack of Python code.  Crucially, a placeholder function `read_desktop_ini` is introduced, acting as a template for how your actual code might look.  Replace this with your code.

2. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The `test_read_desktop_ini_error` function demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for a `FileNotFoundError` or other exceptions. This is essential for robust error handling.

3. **Fixture for File Path:** A `desktop_ini_path` fixture is created to provide the path to your desktop.ini file.  This ensures that tests don't directly use hardcoded paths and promotes better testability.  *Important*:  You'll need to adapt this fixture to work with your actual code.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive about the condition they're testing (e.g., `test_read_desktop_ini_nonexistent_file`).

5. **Missing Code Handling:** The test now checks if the function returns `None` when a file is not found, demonstrating proper handling of this edge case.

6. **Proper Error Message:**  The `test_read_desktop_ini_error` now verifies that the exception message is correct.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace the placeholder function** with your actual code.
2. **Adapt the `desktop_ini_path` fixture** if needed to point to your specific file.
3. **Add assertions** to the tests (e.g., `test_read_desktop_ini_valid_file`) to validate the *contents* of the file if you know what they should look like.
4. **Run the tests:**  `pytest` should find and run the test file.


Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/desktop.ini"` with the actual path to your desktop.ini file. If you have a different file format or a more complex function, the test cases need adjustment accordingly.
