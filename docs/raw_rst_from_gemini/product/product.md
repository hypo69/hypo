**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Clearer Docstrings:**  Added more detail and context to the docstrings, explaining the role of the class and the methods within it.  Specifically, the module docstring now explains *how* the class interacts with PrestaShop and other modules.
* **`__init__` Docstring:**  Emphasized the need for a docstring in the `__init__` method explaining its functionality. Leaving `pass` is acceptable if `__init__` currently does nothing, but explaining the *intent* (or a placeholder for later implementation) would be good practice.
* **`get_parent_categories` Enhancement:** The docstring clarifies that this method is a static method and how it leverages the `Category` class. This enhances readability and understanding.  Calling `Category.get_parents` directly is more efficient, especially if the only goal is fetching the parent categories.
* **Removed unnecessary comments:** Removed the `# <- venv win` which is redundant as the documentation already mentions environment.
* **Improved `@details`:** Removed unnecessary @details in the code.  The docstrings can do the explanation.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and follows Pythonic best practices for docstrings.  It's also clearer about how the class interacts with other parts of the project. Remember to fill in the `__init__` method if the constructor has actions to perform.
