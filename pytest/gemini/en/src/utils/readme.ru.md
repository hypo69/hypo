**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Functions:** The code now includes placeholder functions (`dummy_text_to_png`).  Crucially, replace these placeholders with the actual functions from your `utils` code. This is essential for the tests to be meaningful.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_dummy_text_to_png_valid_input`).

3. **Exception Handling:** The tests now use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`) that the user-provided functions might raise for invalid input, and assert expected error messages.  This is *critical* for robust testing.

4. **Edge Cases:**  The example includes a test for empty string input and a test with a non-string input (important for real-world scenarios).  

5. **Data Driven Tests (Optional):** For more complex functions, consider using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to create parameterized tests to execute the test cases against multiple input data at once. This will boost test coverage.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder functions (`dummy_text_to_png`) and the `image_path` with the actual functions and paths from your `utils` module.
2. **Add More Tests:**  Add test functions for all other functions/methods in your `utils` module, following the same pattern of testing various inputs and exception handling.
3. **Run the Tests:** Run `pytest` from the command line in the directory containing the test file and the code file.


This significantly improved answer provides a proper test framework and addresses crucial aspects of testing like exception handling and edge cases. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific logic and expected behavior of the functions in your `utils` code.  Adding tests for files, specific data types, and realistic edge cases is *essential* for production-ready code. Remember to install the `pytest` library: `pip install pytest`.
