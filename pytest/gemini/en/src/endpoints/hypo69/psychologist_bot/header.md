**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs`:** The tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `gs` module and its `path` attribute. This is crucial because `gs` is external to the code under test and its behavior is not predictable or controllable in a typical test environment. The mock ensures that the code under test does not try to access external files or resources, preventing test flakiness. This effectively isolates the `set_project_root` function.

2. **Handling Missing Files:**  Added tests to verify that the code correctly handles cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` are missing.  It ensures that `settings`, `doc_str`, and the derived variables have appropriate default values.

3. **Comprehensive Settings Tests:** The test now verifies not only if the loading succeeds but also validates that the data loaded from `settings.json` are correctly reflected in the derived variables (__project_name__, __version__, etc.).

4. **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests specifically for missing or invalid `settings.json` and `README.MD` to verify the default values for the derived variables (__project_name__, __version__, etc.).

5. **Clearer Fixture Usage:** The fixtures now return values (e.g., `Path` objects) that are needed for the tests.

6. **Using `tmp_path` fixture:**  Importantly, the tests now use `pytest.tmpdir` (renamed `tmp_path` in newer versions). This creates temporary directories for the test cases, eliminating conflicts and ensuring each test runs in a clean environment.

7. **Error Handling:**  The `test_settings_loading_failure` and `test_readme_loading_failure` tests demonstrate correct error handling, ensuring the variables get the correct default values when file loading fails.


This revised solution significantly improves the test suite by mocking external dependencies, making the tests robust and reliable, especially in environments where file paths or external resources may be unpredictable. Remember to install the necessary libraries:


```bash
pip install pytest
pip install packaging
```

Remember to replace `"mock_path"` with an actual path if you need to interact with an actual file system during your tests.  The `tmp_path` fixture from pytest handles the temporary files correctly and ensures isolation and cleanup.
