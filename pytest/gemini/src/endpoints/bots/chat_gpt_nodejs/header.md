```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.fixture` and `tmp_path` to create a temporary directory for testing.  This avoids hardcoding file paths and ensures that each test runs independently.

2. **Mock Data:**  The `mock_settings` and `mock_doc` functions create mock data, essential for testing when the `settings.json` and README files are not accessible.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more specific about the conditions being tested (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_path`).

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now include cases for different scenarios, such as marker files in different locations (and at different levels), and cases where the marker files aren't present.

5. **Error Handling:** The provided code had `...` in the exception blocks.  I've added assertions to check for the expected error cases, like `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.


6. **Import Correction:** The `import json` is included at the top.


7. **Import `hypotez`:** The `import` statement for `set_project_root` is corrected to import from `hypotez`'s appropriate path.



**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the tests:** Save the provided test code in a file named, for example, `test_header.py` in the same directory as your `header.py` file. 

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved solution provides a much more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `header.py` code. Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual name of your project if it's different.  You can adapt these tests to cover other functions in the file as needed.

**Further Considerations**
 - Consider adding tests for various file types that might be passed to `marker_files` (directories etc).
 - Add tests for handling potential `FileNotFoundError` cases more specifically within the `set_project_root` function.
