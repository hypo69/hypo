**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now better reflect the purpose (e.g., `test_iop_client_execute_valid_input`).

2. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to check for expected exceptions when providing incorrect data.  Crucially, the `assert` statement verifies the *specific* error message, making the test more robust.

3. **Invalid Input Testing:** The `test_iop_client_execute_invalid_input_query` test now demonstrates how to test with invalid input types for a parameter. This is an important edge case. The `test_iop_client_execute_missing_api_param` test demonstrates how to verify an error when a required parameter is missing.  These tests use more helpful error message checks

4. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:**  The original code already creates the necessary objects, so no fixtures are needed in this basic test case.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code above as `test_get.py` (or a similar name).
3.  Run `pytest test_get.py` in your terminal from the directory containing `test_get.py`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **IOP Library Details:** The tests assume the `iop` library behaves in a specific way, as described in the code provided.  If the library's behavior changes, these tests will need adjustment.

* **Realistic Inputs:** You'll likely need to add more comprehensive tests to verify various possible error conditions and different types of responses.  For example, testing different error codes and their respective messages is crucial for robustness.  Add scenarios for different response types.

* **External Dependencies:**  Ensure that the external dependencies of the `iop` library (if any) are correctly installed and available in your test environment.


This improved example demonstrates a more robust and comprehensive approach to testing. Remember to adapt these tests as needed based on the specifics of your `iop` library. Remember, testing error handling is essential in a real-world application.
