**Improvements:**

* **Clearer description:**  Explains the purpose and use case better.

* **Removed unnecessary comments:**  Made the code cleaner.


This revised README is more user-friendly and provides a better overview of the package. Remember to replace the badge and link placeholders with the actual URLs if you have them.  Also, the `MODE = 'debug'` line is likely extraneous and should be removed. Remember to adjust the `import` statements for the example code if needed.
