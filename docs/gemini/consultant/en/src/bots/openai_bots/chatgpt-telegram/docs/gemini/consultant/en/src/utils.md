Received Code
```javascript
import { unlink } from 'fs/promises'
export async function removeFile(path) {
    try {
        await unlink(path)
    } catch (e) {
        console.log('Error while removing file', e.message)
    }
}
```
```
Improved Code
```javascript
import { unlink } from 'fs/promises';
import { logger } from 'src/logger';

/**
 * Removes a file asynchronously.
 *
 * :param path: The path to the file to remove.
 * :raises OSError: If the file does not exist or cannot be removed.
 * :returns: None
 */
export async function removeFile(path) {
    try {
        # Attempt to remove the file.
        await unlink(path);
    } catch (error) {
        # Log the error with detailed information.
        logger.error('Error while removing file:', error);
        # Re-raise the error to allow the calling function to handle it.
        throw error;
    }
}
```
```
Changes Made
```
- Imported `logger` from `src/logger`.
- Added a comprehensive RST-style docstring to the `removeFile` function, including parameter descriptions, exceptions, and return value.
- Replaced `console.log` with `logger.error` for error handling, improving the application's logging and error reporting.
- Wrapped the `unlink` call in a try-catch block, but instead of just logging the error, re-raised it using `throw error`.  This allows the calling function to handle the error appropriately, rather than silently swallowing it.  This is crucial for robust error handling.
- Added missing imports.

```
Final Optimized Code
```javascript
import { unlink } from 'fs/promises';
import { logger } from 'src/logger';

/**
 * Removes a file asynchronously.
 *
 * :param path: The path to the file to remove.
 * :raises OSError: If the file does not exist or cannot be removed.
 * :returns: None
 */
export async function removeFile(path) {
    try {
        # Attempt to remove the file.
        await unlink(path);
    } catch (error) {
        # Log the error with detailed information.
        logger.error('Error while removing file:', error);
        # Re-raise the error to allow the calling function to handle it.
        throw error;
    }
