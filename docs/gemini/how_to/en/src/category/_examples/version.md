How to Use and Understand the `version.py` File

This guide explains the purpose and usage of the `version.py` file, located in the `hypotez/src/category/_examples` directory.  It details the Python variables and documentation strings within the file, crucial for understanding and potentially extending the module.

**File Structure and Purpose**

The `version.py` file is a Python module, likely part of a larger project.  Its primary purpose is to define and document key metadata about the module, such as its version, name, author(s), and potentially other details.  The heavily-commented structure indicates a strong emphasis on documentation and clarity.

**Key Variables and Attributes:**

* **`__version__`:** This string variable holds the version number of the module or package.  In this case, the value is `"3.12.0.0.0.4"`.  Versioning schemes vary, but this suggests a highly specific version.  This is a crucial piece of information for compatibility and updates.

* **`__name__`:** This variable stores the name of the module.  If the script is run directly, its value will be `"__main__"`.  In a typical import, it would be `"_examples.version"` or similar.

* **`__doc__`:** This string variable holds the documentation string for the module.   The comments at the top of the file define the module, which contributes to the value of `__doc__`. It's essential for other developers understanding what the module does, which is critical for maintainability and collaboration.

* **`__details__`:** This variable, set to `"Details about version for module or class"`, likely contains further information about the version, perhaps including specific changes or features introduced in a given release.  It's important to maintain this information for context and tracking.

* **`__annotations__`:**  This variable is currently empty (`__annotations__`). If present, it would contain type hints, declaring the expected data types for variables and function parameters/return types, adding to code clarity and enabling static analysis tools.

* **`__author__`:** This variable stores the author or authors' name(s).  In this case, it is `'hypotez '` (with a trailing space), which is important for attribution and maintainability.


**Documentation Strings (Docstrings):**

The multiple docstrings at the top of the file are multi-line comments that describe the module and its purpose. This documentation is structured using the docstring convention commonly used with Sphinx documentation.  These docstrings will be useful to create documentation and understand the design decisions.

**Best Practices:**

* **Consistency in Versioning:** Adhere to a standard versioning scheme throughout the project (e.g., Semantic Versioning).

* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation within the `__doc__` and `__details__` variables, especially for version numbers and important changes.

* **Type Hinting:**  Use type annotations (`__annotations__`) to improve code readability and maintainability, helping with static analysis.

* **Explicit Author:** Ensure the `__author__` variable has the correct author information to maintain responsibility and provide attribution.


**How to Use/Extend:**

This file is intended to be imported into other parts of the project, likely for version checking or for internal use. You wouldn't directly execute this file, but use the functions and variables it defines within other modules or scripts.
