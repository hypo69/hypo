**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names now explicitly state the condition being tested (e.g., `test_spreadsheet_invalid_input`).

2. **Specific Assertions:** The assertions now check for the expected types and values, making the tests more robust.  Crucially, I added `assert sheet is not None` which is vital for checking a method returns data (instead of simply failing if a `None` is returned).

3. **Exception Handling (pytest.raises):**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to verify that exceptions are raised with invalid inputs, catching the specific error messages. This is a strong test.

4. **Example Fixtures:** I included a basic example fixture (`spreadsheet_data`).  In your actual tests, you'd create fixtures that return the data needed by your tests.  Replace the example fixture with actual data from your files.

5. **Assumptions:** The code includes placeholder comments like `# Assume a method get_sheet exists`.  This is crucial!  If the code in the `hypotez/src/goog/spreadsheet/__init__.py` file doesn't have methods called `get_sheet`, `get_data` etc.,  then the tests will fail, but the failures are helpful.

6. **Completeness:** The test suite is improved for `SpreadSheet` and added `ReachSpreadsheet` tests.  Remember to adapt these tests to match the actual method names, arguments, and expected outcomes in your code.


**How to Use This:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Modify the tests to reflect the actual method names, argument types, and expected outputs in your `SpreadSheet` and `ReachSpreadsheet` classes.  Update `spreadsheet_data` to accurately reflect the data structure.  Change `TypeError` and `ValueError` to the precise exceptions that your code raises for validation failure.


2. **Run the Tests:**  Save this code (with the correct replacements) in a file like `test_spreadsheet.py`.  Then run `pytest test_spreadsheet.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.


This revised example provides a structured and comprehensive approach to testing, which is essential for robust code. Remember to run the tests with your actual code and adjust these examples to reflect the reality of your file.  Proper testing of the exceptions is a vital component of good code testing and these tests now demonstrate that.
