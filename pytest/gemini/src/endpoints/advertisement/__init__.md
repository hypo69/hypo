**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Methods:** The original response lacked methods to test.  The `TestFacebookMethods` class now includes example methods (`fetch_ads`, `do_something`).  **You MUST replace these dummy examples with actual method calls** from your `Facebook` class.  Crucially, this now allows us to test the *structure* and *validity* of method calls.

2. **Error Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used (or a `try...except` block). The test now checks for *specific* exception types (ValueError, TypeError, etc) instead of just catching `Exception`.  This is critical for robust error handling testing.

3. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions now are more specific (e.g., `assert "success" in ...`).  This makes tests more readable and allows you to check for specific results.

4. **Edge Cases:** Tests are added for edge cases (e.g., empty strings, `None` values).

5. **Complete Test Class:** I've included a `TestFacebookMethods` class for better organization and readability. You might have more complex tests requiring multiple test classes.



**How to adapt to your code:**

* **Replace the dummy method and attribute names** with the actual names from your `Facebook` class.
* **Change the assertions** to match the expected return values from your methods.
* **Add more test functions** to cover different parts of your `Facebook` class methods (e.g., invalid parameters, exception handling, specific return values).


This revised response provides a more structured and effective approach to testing your Python code with `pytest`, handling the case where the code only imports a class, which needs dummy methods to test. Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual implementation! Remember to adjust imports and class names as needed to match your file structure. Remember, testing exception handling is critical.
