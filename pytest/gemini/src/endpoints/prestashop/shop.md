**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly state the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_prestashop_shop_init_missing_api_key`).
* **Specific Error Messages:**  Uses `pytest.raises(ValueError, match="...")` to check for the correct error message, making tests more robust and informative.
* **Fixture for Credentials:**  A `credentials` fixture is created to provide valid data, making the tests more organized and reusable.
* **Fixture for Invalid Credentials:** Added `invalid_credentials` fixture for testing the error case more effectively.
* **Comprehensive Error Cases:** Tests cover cases where `api_domain` or `api_key` are missing, are both missing, or are invalid.
* **Example of Additional Tests:**  The code includes comments on how to add tests for other methods if they exist in the `PrestaShopShop` class.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_shop.py`) in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/shop.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_shop.py`

This improved test suite provides more robust coverage of the `PrestaShopShop` class, ensuring that it handles various input scenarios correctly. Remember to adapt the `...` placeholders with the actual test logic for any other methods of the class if available.  The example addition (commented out) shows how to test a hypothetical `method_name`. Remember to replace the placeholder values for any example assertions. Remember to adapt the imports to your project's structure if necessary.
