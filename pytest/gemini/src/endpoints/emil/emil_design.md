# Add more test cases for other functions (promote_to_facebook, upload_to_PrestaShop)

# the OpenAIModel object and its methods.

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now extensively uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock external dependencies like `read_text_file`, `get_filenames`, `logger` and `OpenAIModel`.  This isolates the tests from external calls and prevents them from interacting with actual files or APIs.

2. **Temporary Directories:**  The `tmpdir` fixture from `pytest` is crucial.  It creates temporary directories for test data, avoiding issues with file persistence and ensuring tests are clean and isolated.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The example `test_describe_images_valid_input` provides a good start.  Crucially, it now creates mock files and a temporary directory structure to correctly exercise the code paths and file operations.

4. **Edge Cases:** The `test_describe_images_invalid_input` test case is added to show how to handle the case where no images are found.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now check for the existence of the `images_descritions_he.json` file and properly handle empty or incorrect data.

6. **Error Handling:** More importantly, tests should handle potential exceptions that the original code may raise.


**How to Run:**

1. Install pytest:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_emil_design.py`).

3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_emil_design.py
   ```

Remember to adapt the test cases further to fully cover all possible scenarios and error conditions in the `EmilDesign` class, including edge cases, invalid input, and different ways the AI model might respond.  Mock the `OpenAIModel.describe_image` method in a similar fashion to ensure the tests exercise the relevant internal logic.  Don't forget to replace placeholder comments with real assertions.
