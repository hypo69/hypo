""" Global Project Settings: paths, passwords, logins, and API settings.

Start-up settings for the program.

Sensitive information such as passwords, keys, APIs, and other credentials
are stored in `credentials.kdbx` and need the master password to open the database.

To ensure cross-OS compatibility of paths, all paths are declared as `Path` objects.

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY:**  The password for `credentials.kdbx` is stored in `password.txt` in the project.  This is a severe security risk.  **DO NOT STORE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT WITHIN YOUR CODE OR PROJECT FILES.**  Immediately remove this vulnerability.  Use a secure mechanism for retrieving the password, such as environment variables or a securely-stored file (e.g., one encrypted with a strong key).

TODO: The root directory can have any name. Currently, it is hardcoded as `hypotez`. Need to add the option to choose the name of the root directory in the configuration file.

**Explanation of Changes and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Cryptography:** The code now uses the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt the password. This is **mandatory** to protect the password.
2. **Secure Password Storage:** The password is now encrypted using `Fernet`. The encryption key is stored as an environment variable (`PASSWORD_KEY`).  **Crucially**, this code now expects that the key is *not* stored in the repository. You'll need a separate process (or a different mechanism) to securely set the environment variable before running your application.  This separation is essential for security.

3. **Password Decryption:** The code now decrypts the password from `password.txt` using the `Fernet` key, preventing the plain text password from being present in the source code.

4. **Error Handling:** Added robust error handling to catch exceptions during encryption/decryption and key retrieval, preventing silent failures.

5. **Key Generation (Important):** The code now generates a Fernet key and stores it in an environment variable.  Critically, the key generation happens *outside* the repository.  You would need to generate this key in a secure manner on your machine and set the `PASSWORD_KEY` environment variable.

6. **Password Handling:** The `_load_credentials` function now has a correct signature to pass the decryption key `key` and the method `_open_kp` now takes the password as a parameter. This keeps your password separate from the rest of the sensitive data.



**How to Use:**

1. **Install cryptography:**
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

2. **Generate the key:**  (Do this *outside* of your Git repository)


3. **Set the environment variable:**  (Do this *outside* of your Git repository)
   ```bash
   export PASSWORD_KEY=<Your-key-here>
   ```
   Replace `<Your-key-here>` with the base64 encoded bytes of the key.

4. **Store the encrypted password:**  In your `password.txt` file, store the encrypted password.

5. **Run your code:** Your code will now load the encrypted password correctly.



**Absolutely critical:** Do *not* commit this file with the generated key.   Store that key securely in your environment variables or elsewhere. If your repository has the key stored, it introduces a serious security risk.


This revised approach dramatically enhances the security of your code. Remember, never commit sensitive data directly to your Git repository.
