# Import any necessary modules here.  For example, if you need
# PrestaShop client libraries, or other helper functions.
#
# Example:
# from prestashop_client import Client
# from utils import get_domain_config

# Add your code for domain-related functionality here.
# This could include functions to retrieve domain information,
# interact with the PrestaShop API for domains, etc.

# Example:
# def get_domain_details(domain_id):
#     """Retrieves details for a specific domain."""
#     # ... (implementation to retrieve and return domain details)
#     return domain_details
#
# def update_domain_config(domain_id, new_config):
#   """Update the configuration for a specific domain."""
#   # ...(implementation to interact with configuration storage,e.g., database)
#   return True if success else False

# ... (Other functions related to domains)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:**  The code now has a placeholder for `import` statements.  Crucially, you need to import any necessary libraries (e.g., `prestashop_client` if you're using a PrestaShop API client, or any other libraries for configuration, databases, etc.).  Add those imports here.

2. **Function Placeholders:** Empty function placeholders (`get_domain_details`, `update_domain_config`) are added.  These functions represent the *actual* logic you'll need to implement for your domain handling.  Fill these in with the code that connects to PrestaShop API, retrieves/modifies data, and performs domain-related actions.

3. **Docstrings:**  The docstrings are now more informative and helpful. The function docstrings (`get_domain_details`, etc.) should explain what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.

4. **Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling to your functions.  For example, if a function fails to retrieve domain data, it should return an appropriate error message or code instead of crashing.

5. **Missing Context:** The comments suggest you're working with PrestaShop domains. To make the code more useful, clarify how the `domain_id` (or other domain identifiers) is used, where the configuration is stored, and what kind of interaction with PrestaShop is required.

**How to use this file:**

You'd call functions from this module in other parts of your application (likely in your application's main logic, or controller) to perform actions related to domains (e.g., getting the details for a specific domain, updating the domain's configuration).


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
# In another part of your code...
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains import get_domain_details

try:
    domain_data = get_domain_details(123)  # Replace 123 with the actual domain ID.
    if domain_data:
        print(f"Domain details: {domain_data}")
    else:
        print("No domain found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual implementation.  Also, adjust the import statements and function names to match your specific project needs.
