**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically important for testing `get_project_root` because it relies on file existence and paths.  The `mock_open` function now correctly handles different file paths. The `Path.exists` method is mocked to control whether files are found at different levels of the tree.  `Path.cwd` is also mocked to provide the correct current working directory for the tests. This prevents the tests from relying on the actual file system.

2. **Clear `sys.path`:** Added `sys.path.clear()` within each test function. This is crucial to prevent interactions between tests.  Each test now has a clean environment.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios:
   - A valid case where the marker files are in the current directory.
   - A case where the marker files are in a parent directory.
   - A case where the marker files are not found in any parent directories.
   - An invalid input case (passing a non-tuple to `marker_files`).

4. **Fixtures:** Introduced `settings_data` and `root_path` fixtures for better organization and code reusability, particularly for the tests related to settings loading.

5. **Error Handling:** The `test_settings_loading_failure` test now correctly asserts that `settings` is `None` when the file is not found.

6. **Global Variable Handling:**  The `test_settings_loading_success` and `test_settings_loading_failure` functions correctly handle the global variable `settings`, resetting it to `None` before each test.

7. **`pytest.raises`:**  Included a test (`test_get_project_root_invalid_input`) that demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for a specific exception.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_grandadvance_header.py`).
2.  Create the mock data files (`test_settings.json`, `test_README.MD`).
3.  Run `pytest test_grandadvance_header.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution is significantly more robust and accurately tests the functionality of the code, considering various file system scenarios and potential errors. Remember to replace `"test_project_root"` with the actual path to your test directory.   The mocks are crucial; without them, the tests would be dependent on your file system layout.
