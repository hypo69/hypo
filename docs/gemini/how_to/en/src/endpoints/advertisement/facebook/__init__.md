# Usage Guide for hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/__init__.py

This file acts as an entry point for the Facebook advertisement functionalities within the `hypotez` project.  It imports necessary classes and functions for interacting with Facebook's advertising API.

**Key Imports:**

* **`from .facebook import Facebook`**: Imports the `Facebook` class, likely representing a base class or object for handling Facebook-related interactions.  You'll use instances of this class to perform actions.  Refer to the documentation for `Facebook` for specific methods.

* **`from .facebook_fields import FacebookFields`**: Imports `FacebookFields`.  This likely contains predefined constants or data structures representing Facebook advertisement fields (e.g., ad targeting options, campaign types).  Understanding these fields is crucial for building effective Facebook advertisements.

* **`from .promoter import FacebookPromoter, get_event_url`**: Imports classes/functions related to Facebook promotion management.
    * **`FacebookPromoter`**:  Likely a class to handle actions like creating, updating, or running Facebook ad campaigns.  Consult its documentation for methods available.
    * **`get_event_url`**: A function to retrieve the URL associated with a Facebook event.


**MODE Constant:**

The `MODE = 'dev'` line sets a mode, likely used for configuration or different operational environments (e.g., development, production).  You should adjust this value as needed.

**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook import Facebook, FacebookPromoter

# Instantiate a Facebook object (replace with necessary parameters)
facebook_instance = Facebook(access_token='YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN', account_id='YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID')

# Instantiate a FacebookPromoter object (replace with necessary parameters)
promoter = FacebookPromoter(
    facebook_instance, 
    campaign_name='Example Campaign',
    target_audience='...', # replace with appropriate parameters
    ...)


# Get a Facebook event URL (assuming get_event_url is accessible).
event_url = get_event_url(event_id='YOUR_EVENT_ID')  

# Perform actions using the FacebookPromoter methods (example)
try:
    campaign_result = promoter.create_campaign() 
    print(f"Campaign created successfully: {campaign_result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating campaign: {e}")


```

**Further Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The example includes a `try...except` block.  Robust code should always include error handling to manage potential exceptions during Facebook API interactions.
* **Authentication:** Ensure you properly handle authentication and obtain the necessary access tokens to interact with the Facebook API. The examples above demonstrate the need to provide parameters.
* **Documentation:** Refer to the specific documentation for each module (`Facebook`, `FacebookFields`, `FacebookPromoter`) to understand their specific parameters, methods, and usage.
* **API Limits:** Be mindful of Facebook API limits to avoid issues like rate limiting.
* **Dependencies:**  This code likely relies on other libraries (e.g., for interacting with Facebook APIs, possibly the `facebook-ads-python` library). Ensure these are installed correctly.


This guide provides a starting point.  Detailed examples and further guidance will be available in the specific documentation for the `facebook`, `facebook_fields`, and `promoter` modules.  Thoroughly explore those files for complete understanding.
