```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks `os.getcwd()` and `Path` for testing.  Crucially, this isolates the test from the real file system, avoiding unexpected behavior and side effects.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:**  Test cases are better structured and clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

3. **Boundary/Edge Cases:** Included tests checking for a project name different than 'hypotez' and a scenario where 'hypotez' is not found in the path.

4. **Exception Handling:** Added a test (`test_root_path_exception_handling`) to verify that the code handles the case where the project root path cannot be calculated (no 'hypotez' directory). The test now asserts that no exception was raised, indicating graceful handling.


5. **Restored sys.path:**  The code now stores the original `sys.path` before modification, then restores it after each test.  This is **absolutely essential** to avoid side effects between tests.  If you don't do this, tests may fail unexpectedly due to previous tests altering the global state of `sys.path`.


6. **Import:** The import `import hypotez.src.webdriver.firefox._examples.header` is essential for correctly testing the appending to the sys.path; otherwise, the path is not appended when the function runs.  


This revised solution is robust and addresses the potential issues of the previous example, providing a reliable test suite. Remember to adapt the mock paths to match your specific testing environment.
