<h1>Module: QUESTIONS</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module contains questions and answers related to a system's configuration files.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3>Why are configuration files named after the module (e.g., suppliers.json)?  Is it not better to name them config.json?</h3>

<h2>Answers</h2>

<h3>Answer 1</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: This answer explains the reasoning behind using module-specific file names for configuration files.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:  The naming convention (e.g., suppliers.json) is chosen for clarity and maintainability.  It allows AI models to easily identify the specific configuration settings related to a particular module, such as supplier information in this example.  Using a generic name like config.json would make it harder to pinpoint the settings relevant to a particular module, leading to potential confusion and errors. This specific naming convention improves code maintainability and reduces the likelihood of misconfigurations by explicitly associating configuration data with the functionality it supports.</p>
