```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The `test_settings_not_found` and `test_settings_invalid_json` functions now correctly use `pytest.raises` to assert that the expected exceptions (`FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`) are caught.

2. **Cleanup:** Crucial `os.remove('../settings.json')` statements are added to clean up the temporary test file after each test that creates one. This prevents issues with subsequent tests. This is *essential* for automated testing.

3. **Comprehensive Tests:**  `test_default_values` and `test_settings_data` tests cover more scenarios, ensuring the correct retrieval and fallback behavior when `settings` are missing or invalid.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**  Comments are added to explain the logic behind each test case, making it easier to understand the purpose and expected outcome.

5. **Realistic Test Data:** The example `settings.json` used for testing includes all the relevant keys for complete verification of the extraction logic.


This revised solution addresses the potential issues identified and provides more robust test coverage for the code under test.  Remember to run `pytest` from the command line in the directory containing the test file and the `version.py` file to execute the tests. Remember to create the temporary `settings.json` files for testing.
