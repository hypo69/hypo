**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **HTML Content Simulation:** The tests now simulate fetching the HTML content. This is *critical* because the original test was missing this crucial step; you can't directly interact with the HTML elements without fetching the HTML first.  Replace the placeholder with your actual method of getting the HTML content (e.g., if you're using a FastAPI application, fetch it as part of a test request).


2. **Mocking AJAX:** The `test_form_submission_valid_input` example now demonStartes how to mock the AJAX call using `unittest.mock` (replace with the appropriate mocking library in your testing environment). This is essential to isolate the tests and prevent external network calls that would introduce instability.  You *must* mock the AJAX call to verify the form submission logic without actually interacting with the external API.  


3. **Specific Assertions:** The test cases now need *specific assertions* regarding the expected behavior. For example, if you're simulating a POST request, verify that the correct data was sent to the API endpoint and the mock response was handled correctly.


4. **Edge Cases:** The example test cases now include a basic empty input test.  Add more tests to cover other edge cases, such as very large inputs, special characters, and potential data validation issues.


5. **Error Handling:** The `test_ajax_error_handling` case shows how to test the error handling part of your JavaScript code. You'll need to simulate an error response and assert that the error handler (`error` function in your JavaScript) is called and handles the response correctly.

**Before running these tests:**

* **Install `pytest` and `unittest.mock`:**
```bash
pip install pytest unittest
```

* **Adapt the HTML Content and Mocking:** Modify the example simulations to match your specific implementation of fetching HTML and making AJAX calls.


* **Focus on JavaScript Logic:**  Tests should now be designed to validate the *JavaScript* code. The core functionality you're testing is the correct implementation of the AJAX call with the proper data and appropriate error handling.


Remember that this is a substantial rewrite to properly test the JavaScript code.  You need to mock (simulate) the external API call (using `unittest.mock` or similar) to prevent real network calls from interfering.
