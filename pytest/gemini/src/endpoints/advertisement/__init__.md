```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement import Facebook

# Tests for Facebook class (assuming Facebook has methods and attributes)
# Replace these placeholders with actual methods and attributes from your code.

def test_facebook_initialization():
    """Tests the initialization of the Facebook class."""
    fb = Facebook()
    assert isinstance(fb, Facebook)
    # Add assertions for other attributes if necessary
    # Example: assert fb.mode == 'dev'


def test_facebook_method_with_valid_input():
    """Tests a method of the Facebook class with valid input."""
    fb = Facebook()
    # Replace with a valid method call and expected output
    # Example:

    # Example with a mocked return value
    # from unittest.mock import MagicMock
    # fb.get_ad_data = MagicMock(return_value={'data': 'something'})
    # result = fb.get_ad_data(123)
    # assert result['data'] == 'something'
    pass  # Replace with your actual method call


def test_facebook_method_with_invalid_input():
    """Tests a method of the Facebook class with invalid input."""
    fb = Facebook()
    # Replace with an invalid method call and expected exception
    # Example:
    # with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
    #     fb.get_ad_data(-1)
    # assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid input"
    pass  # Replace with your actual method call and exception assertion


def test_facebook_method_with_edge_case():
    """Tests a method of the Facebook class with an edge case."""

    # Replace with an edge case method call and expected behavior
    # Example:
    # result = fb.get_ad_data(0)
    # assert result == expected_output
    pass # Replace with your actual method call and assertion


def test_facebook_method_with_none_input():
    """Tests a method of the Facebook class with None as input."""
    fb = Facebook()
    # Replace with method call with None input and expected output or exception
    # Example with exception:
    # with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
    #     fb.get_ad_data(None)
    # assert str(excinfo.value) == "Input cannot be None"
    pass # Replace with your actual method call and assertion



# Add more tests for other methods or scenarios as needed. Remember to:
# - Replace the placeholder methods with the actual ones from your code.
# - Provide realistic input and expected output for valid cases.
# - Define appropriate exceptions for invalid cases.
# - Use pytest.raises for exception handling.
# - Consider edge cases, boundary conditions, and unusual inputs.

```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the input and expected behavior.

2. **Placeholder Replacement:** The code includes placeholders (`# Replace with...`) for you to fill in the actual methods, attributes, and expected behavior from your `Facebook` class.  Crucially, you *must* replace these with the *actual* code from your `Facebook` class.

3. **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling and mocking with `unittest.mock.MagicMock`.  This is a much better way to test methods that interact with external services (which your `Facebook` class likely does).

4. **Complete Test Structure:** The provided structure now includes tests for initialization, valid input, invalid input, edge cases, and None input.  You should add more tests to cover the full range of functionality in your `Facebook` class.

5. **Important: Mocking for External Interactions:** If your `Facebook` class interacts with an external API (like Facebook's), use mocking (`unittest.mock`) to prevent actual API calls during testing.  This makes your tests independent of external factors.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the comments in the test functions with the actual methods, attributes, and expected behaviors from your `Facebook` class.

2. **Add More Tests:** Create tests for each function and scenario in your `Facebook` class.

3. **Run Tests:** Execute `pytest` from your terminal in the directory containing your test file (and the `hypotez` directory) to run the tests.

**Example for a `get_ad_data` method:**

```python
# In your hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook.py:

class Facebook:
    def get_ad_data(self, ad_id):
        if ad_id is None:
            raise TypeError("Input cannot be None")
        if ad_id < 0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid ad ID")
        # ... your actual Facebook API call
        return {"ad_id": ad_id, "status": "active"}
```

```python
# In your test file:
def test_facebook_get_ad_data_valid_input():
    fb = Facebook()
    result = fb.get_ad_data(123)
    assert result == {"ad_id": 123, "status": "active"}
```

Remember to adapt this to your specific code, including any necessary imports and exception types. Remember to replace placeholders with actual code and ensure the test file is in the same directory structure as the code under test.
