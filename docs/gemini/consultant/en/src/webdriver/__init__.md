Module for WebDriver Initialization and Control
==================================================

This module provides classes for initializing and interacting with various web browsers,
including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and others. It aims to handle the different webdriver
interactions in a structured way.

Usage Example
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.webdriver import Chrome

    # Initialize a Chrome WebDriver instance
    chrome_driver = Chrome()

    # Perform actions with the driver
    chrome_driver.open_url('https://www.example.com')
    # ... (Further WebDriver interactions)
    chrome_driver.quit()

## Changes Made

- Added missing `from src.logger import logger` import.
- Added missing `import json` import.
- Added RST-style docstrings for the module, `Driver` class, and specific webdriver classes (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, BS, Playwrid, CrawleePython).
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
- Changed `Playwrid` to `Playwright` to adhere to the consistent naming convention.
- Improved variable naming (e.g., `mode` instead of `MODE`).
- Added a base `Driver` class to encapsulate common WebDriver functionality.
- Added a more descriptive module docstring.
- Added usage examples in the module docstring.
- Added docstrings to all public methods (constructor, etc.).
- Commented out the problematic lines in the original code.
