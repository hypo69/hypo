**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_string`, `test_version_author`).
* **Assertions:**  Explicit assertions are used to check the expected types and values of the attributes.
* **Type Handling:**  Checks the correct type of the attributes (`__version__`, `__name__`, etc.).  This is crucial to ensure data integrity.
* **Specific Assertions for Values (crucial):**  The test now checks if the `__version__`, `__details__`, `__author__` variables hold the correct expected string values rather than just checking their type.
* **`pytest.skip` (Important):**  The test for `__name__` is commented out.  Testing this variable during test execution is generally not recommended as `__name__` depends on the program execution environment (is it imported, run as a script).  Consider skipping it if testing in an environment where it might be hard to control or if it's not crucial for testing the module's internal functionality.
* **MODE Test:** A test for the `MODE` variable is added, assuming it should be testable.
* **Docstring Testing:**  Test for `__doc__` includes a check for a docstring.
* **File Existence:**  Added a note about the importance of the file existing, and the potential for failing tests if the file is missing.

This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `version.py` module, addressing the issues in the previous example and following best practices. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific requirements of the project. Remember to adjust the file path if your file structure is different.
