**Changes Made**

* Added missing imports (`from src.logger import logger`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`).
* Incorporated `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for data handling.
* Added RST-style docstrings to all modules, functions, and variables (though the examples are missing actual function definitions).
* Removed unnecessary and redundant comments/descriptions.
* Improved formatting and structure of the module descriptions.
* Consistent use of single quotes (`'`) in Python code.
* Implemented `logger.error` for error handling (where appropriate, examples are missing actual code).
