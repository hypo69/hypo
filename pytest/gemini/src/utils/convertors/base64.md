```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly indicate the input type and expected outcome (e.g., `test_base64_to_tmpfile_valid_input`).
* **Explicit Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test exceptions for invalid Base64, empty content, and type errors.
* **Data Fixtures:** Fixtures (`base64_content`, `file_name`) are used to isolate test data, promoting code reusability and readability.
* **Resource Cleanup:** The code now removes the temporary file using `os.remove(tmp_file_path)` after each test to prevent file system pollution.  This is *crucial* for automated testing.
* **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Tests now include cases for empty content, invalid Base64, non-string input for `content` and `file_name`.  This significantly improves test coverage.
* **Example Usage:** The example usage in the docstring has been preserved and validated.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_base64.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_base64.py`

This revised solution provides a more robust and thorough test suite for the `base64_to_tmpfile` function. Remember to adapt the tests based on the specific requirements and expected behavior of your code. Remember to include a test for the case where the input Base64 is empty.
