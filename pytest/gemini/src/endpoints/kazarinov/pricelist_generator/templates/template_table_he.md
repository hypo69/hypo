**Explanation and Important Considerations**

The provided code is HTML, not Python.  You cannot directly test Python functions or classes with it.  To write meaningful tests, you need the Python code that renders this HTML template, handles the data, etc.

* **Missing Python Code:** The critical part for writing tests is missing: the Python code that actually uses this HTML template.  This code would interact with data, call functions, and create the `products`, `title`, etc. variables to populate the template.  Without that Python code, all tests would be placeholders.

* **Example Tests:** The provided example tests use placeholders (`assert True`, `assert False`). These need to be replaced with assertions that verify the actual behavior of the Python code using the HTML.  You need the Python code to test the *implementation* not the HTML structure itself.

* **Templating Engine:** If the HTML is rendered using a templating engine like Jinja2, you would need to have the relevant functions, and test interactions of those functions.


**Example with a (hypothetical) Python implementation (crucial for testing):**

```python
# Hypothetical Python code that uses the HTML template

from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

def generate_pricelist_html(products, title, description, currency, price):
    # ... (Code to load and render the template)
    env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('.'))  # Load the template
    template = env.get_template('template_table_he.html')
    html_output = template.render(products=products, title=title, description=description, currency=currency, price=price)
    return html_output


# (Example data, again hypothetical)
products = [{"product_title": "Product A", "image_local_saved_path": "image1.jpg"},
            {"product_title": "Product B", "image_local_saved_path": "image2.jpg"}]
title = "Price List"
description = "List of products"
currency = "NIS"
price = 100


html_content = generate_pricelist_html(products, title, description, currency, price)


# Example of a testable Python function using the template
def test_generate_pricelist_html():
    # ... assertions regarding the structure of the generated HTML using the string.
    # Example:
    assert 'Product A' in html_content # Check for specific string in the content.
    # more assertions to check all the expected data in the rendered output.
```

In this hypothetical example, the `generate_pricelist_html` function uses the HTML template. Now you can write tests to verify its behavior (e.g., ensuring correct data is populated in the HTML output).  **The tests need to focus on the *functionality* in the Python code, not just the structure of the HTML file.**
