```

**Changes Made**

- Added a comprehensive module-level docstring in reStructuredText format.
- Removed unused comments (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`, shebangs).  These were standard Python but not necessary in this context.
- Added import `from src.logger import logger` to enable logging.
- Removed unnecessary `# noqa` in all imports to improve code clarity (in future, these might become important for a larger project).
- Added `# noqa` to the `MODE` line for clarity, even though it is not part of the API or logic. This avoids a comment in the RST docs, though it's up for debate if `noqa` is needed in this context.
