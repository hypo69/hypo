How to Train and Use a Discord Bot for Model Training
=======================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to train a machine learning model using a Discord bot.  It covers preparing data, initiating training, monitoring progress, testing the model, and interacting with the trained model via a question-and-answer command.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Ensure the Bot is Running:** Verify that your bot is operational and logged in.  Check your console for a message confirming the bot's login status, like `Logged in as YourBotName#1234`.

2. **Invite the Bot to Your Server:** Add the bot to your Discord server and grant it necessary permissions, specifically the ability to read and send messages.

3. **Prepare Your Training Data:**  Gather the data required to train the model. This can be in two formats:
    a. **Text Data:** Prepare a text string containing the data for training.
    b. **File Data:** Prepare a file containing the training data.  Ensure the file is accessible from your local machine.


4. **Use the Training Command:**
    a. **Method 1: Using Text Data:** In a Discord channel where the bot is present, send the following command, including your training data and whether it's positive or negative:
       ```plaintext
       !train "Your training data here" positive=True
       ```
       Example:
       ```plaintext
       !train "Sample training data" positive=True
       ```
    b. **Method 2: Uploading a File:** Attach the training data file to a message in a Discord channel. Then send a command to trigger the training process, specifying whether the data is positive or negative:
       ```plaintext
       !train positive=True
       ```
       Example:
       ```plaintext
       !train positive=True
       ```

5. **Monitor Training:** After sending the training command, the bot will respond with a message acknowledging the start of the training job, including a unique job ID:
   ```plaintext
   Model training started. Job ID: <job_id>
   ```

6. **Verify Training Status (Optional):**  If needed, implement additional commands in your bot to check the status of the training job.  This typically involves querying the model object for the job status.

7. **Test the Model:** To evaluate the trained model, use the `!test` command with appropriate test data in a JSON format:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"test_key": "test_value"}
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"input": "Test input data"}
   ```
   The bot will respond with the model's predictions.

8. **Manage Data (Optional):** Utilize other commands like `!archive` to manage files and `!select_dataset` to choose training data sets for specific training tasks:
    - **Archiving Files:**
      ```plaintext
      !archive <directory_path>
      ```
      Example:
      ```plaintext
      !archive /path/to/directory
      ```
    - **Selecting Dataset:**
      ```plaintext
      !select_dataset <path_to_dir_positive> positive=True
      ```
      Example:
      ```plaintext
      !select_dataset /path/to/positive_data positive=True
      ```


9. **Add a Question-and-Answer Command (Important):** To interact with your trained model, add a command for users to ask questions:
    a. **Add `ask` Command:** Implement the `ask` command in your bot's script, including a method in your model class (`ask`) to query the model for responses.
    b. **Run the Bot:** Make sure your bot is running in your Discord server.
    c. **Ask Questions:**  Use the `!ask` command to interact with the trained model:
       ```plaintext
       !ask What is the capital of France?
       ```
       The bot should respond with the model's answer:
       ```plaintext
       Model response: The capital of France is Paris.
       ```


Usage example
-------------------------
```
```
```python
# Example of a simplified ask function
async def ask_question(question):
  # ... (Implementation to query the model)
  answer = "The answer is: " + model.answer(question)
  return answer
```
```
