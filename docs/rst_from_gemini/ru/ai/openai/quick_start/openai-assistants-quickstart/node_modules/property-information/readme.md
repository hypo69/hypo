## What is this?

This package provides information about web platform properties and attributes, including HTML, SVG, ARIA, XML, XMLNS, and XLink.  The property names follow the sensible naming scheme used by hast.  It details data types, such as whether attributes are booleans or contain space-separated values.


## When should I use this?

Use this package when working with hast (an HTML AST) or similar Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures.  It's helpful for determining valid properties, their data types, and their appropriate casing.


## Install

This package is ESM only.

**Node.js (14.14+ and 16.0+):**

```bash
npm install property-information
```

**Deno (using esm.sh):**

```javascript
import * as propertyInformation from 'https://esm.sh/property-information@6';
```

**Browsers (using esm.sh):**

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as propertyInformation from 'https://esm.sh/property-information@6?bundle';
</script>
```

## Use

```javascript
import { html, svg, find, normalize } from 'property-information';

console.log(find(html, 'className')); // or find(html, 'class')
console.log(find(svg, 'horiz-adv-x')); // or find(svg, 'horizAdvX')
console.log(find(html, 'aria-valuenow')); // or find(html, 'ariaValueNow')

// Example with data attributes:
console.log(find(html, 'data-date-of-birth')); // or find(html, 'dataDateOfBirth')
```

This will output information about the properties, including the attribute name, property name, and potential data type hints.


## API

### find(schema, name)

Retrieves information about a specific property.

*   **schema:**  Either the `html` or `svg` export.
*   **name:** The attribute or property name to look up.  Case-insensitive and normalized using `normalize()`.


#### Returns:

An `Info` object (see below).  Handles standard, legacy, and some non-standard properties.  Provides hints about the value type.


#### Examples:

```javascript
// Example with standard properties
console.log(find(html, 'class')); // outputs the 'class' property info
console.log(find(html, 'for')); // outputs the 'htmlFor' property info


// Example with data attributes
console.log(find(html, 'data-date-of-birth')); // Outputs data-attribute info.

// Example with unknown attribute
console.log(find(html, 'unknownAttribute'));  // Outputs attribute and property using the original name
```

### normalize(name)

Normalizes an attribute or property name, making it case-insensitive and appropriate for use with `html` or `svg` schemas.

#### Returns:

The normalized property name.


#### Examples

```javascript
console.log(normalize('for'));     // Outputs 'htmlFor'
console.log(normalize('VIEWBOX'));  // Outputs 'viewBox'
console.log(normalize('unknown'));  // Outputs undefined if not found
```


### html, svg

These exports represent schemas for HTML and SVG properties, respectively.  They contain information about the properties and attributes within each schema.


#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(html.property.htmlFor);
console.log(svg.property.viewBox);
```

#### Schema

An object containing:

*   `space`: The primary space ('html' or 'svg').
*   `normal`: A map of normalized attribute/property names to the properly cased property name.
*   `property`: A map of property names to `Info` objects.


#### Info

An object describing a specific property:

* `space`: Space where this property is defined (e.g., 'html').
* `attribute`: The attribute name (e.g., 'class').
* `property`: The camel-cased property name (e.g., 'className').
* Type hints for various data types (e.g., `boolean`, `number`, `spaceSeparated`).

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Clearer explanations:**  More concise and direct explanations of each function and concept.
* **Concise Examples:**  Illustrative examples focusing on key functionality without excess verbosity.
* **API Focus:**  Emphasizes the API structure and provides clearer examples of how to use the key functions like `find` and `normalize`.
* **Structure:**  Maintains the overall structure of the original markdown, but improves readability and organization.
* **Omission of Large Tables:**  Tables were very large.  While this is an improvement, the original README is critical for the *comprehensive* support information.  You'd need to preserve that.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Complete Support Table:**  The original README contains a very important table outlining the supported properties.  **Do not remove or modify this table!**  You need to carefully maintain this information if you are creating a condensed README.
* **External Links:** The original README included links to other related packages and documentation.  These should be preserved as well.
* **Context:**  This condensed README is helpful for a quick overview but is not a full replacement for the original.  The original document is essential for comprehensive understanding of the library and its capabilities.


To use this improved README effectively, include the complete support table and external links.  Make sure to replace placeholders like `URL_TO_CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE`, `URL_TO_LICENSE`, `URL_TO_AUTHOR` with the actual URLs.
