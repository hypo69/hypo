```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` for `mock_settings_json` to create a temporary `settings.json` file for testing purposes. This is crucial for isolating test cases and avoiding side effects.  Also a fixture for `mock_requirements_txt` was added.

* **Error Handling:** Includes tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, ensuring that the code handles potential issues gracefully.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, making the purpose of each test immediately apparent.

* **Edge Cases:** The tests now cover cases where the marker file is in a parent or grandparent directory, as well as cases where the marker file is missing or there is no `pyproject.toml` file.

* **Realistic Path Handling:** The code now correctly deals with the fact that `__file__` in a test environment will likely not be in the same directory as the code being tested.

* **sys.path Modifications:**  Crucially, the code now modifies `sys.path` *before* attempting to access `settings.json`. This ensures that Python can find the test setup directory.

* **Tests for README.MD:** A test (`test_read_readme`) has been added to confirm the correct retrieval of `doc_str` if the README.MD file is present.

* **Comprehensive Validation:** Tests for `settings.json` now include checking if the file is empty or if it has invalid JSON, making the tests more robust.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`.
3.  Run the tests: `pytest test_header.py`.


This improved solution provides a more thorough and realistic set of tests, covering various scenarios and potential issues. Remember to replace placeholders like `"mock_settings.json"` with actual file paths if you have a different test setup. Remember to import the functions you want to test!
