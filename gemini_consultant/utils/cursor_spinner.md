Code Review: hypotez/src/utils/cursor_spinner.py

This file provides a function to display a spinning cursor in the console, useful for indicating ongoing tasks. The code is well-structured and readable.

**Strengths:**

* **Clear docstrings:** The docstrings accurately describe the purpose, arguments, and return values of the functions.
* **Informative example usage:** The example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates how to use the `show_spinner` function.
* **Correct use of `sys.stdout.flush()`:** Critically important, this ensures the spinner is displayed immediately, preventing the spinner from lagging behind, especially on Windows.
* **`\b` for backspace:** This is essential for correctly overwriting the previous character in the spinner sequence.
* **`spinning_cursor` as a generator:** This is an elegant way to generate the cursor sequence without creating a large list of characters in memory.
* **Correct `delay` and `duration` types (float):** This improves flexibility and allows for non-integer timings.

**Minor Suggestions:**

* **Error Handling:** While not strictly necessary for this simple spinner, adding a basic `try...except` block around the `time.sleep()` call can make the function more robust.  For example, if there's an unexpected interruption, it would prevent an error from halting the program.  However, in this case, the sleep is very likely not to be interrupted.
```python
    try:
        time.sleep(delay)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during sleep: {e}")
        return
```

* **`duration` validation:**  Consider adding a check to ensure `duration` is a positive number.  Negative durations could cause unexpected behavior.

```python
    if duration <= 0:
        print("Error: duration must be positive.")
        return
```

* **Import efficiency (minor):** While not a significant issue, the `import sys` could be moved closer to the top of the file after the `""" module: src.utils """` line for better readability.


**Overall:**

The code is well-written and functional.  The inclusion of `sys.stdout.flush()` and proper backspacing makes it a robust solution for displaying a console spinner.  Adding the error handling and validation as suggested would further improve its robustness and maintainability.


**Example incorporating suggestions:**

```python
import time
import sys

def spinning_cursor():
    while True:
        for cursor in '|/-\\':
            yield cursor

def show_spinner(duration: float = 5.0, delay: float = 0.1):
    if duration <= 0:
        print("Error: duration must be positive.")
        return

    spinner = spinning_cursor()
    end_time = time.time() + duration

    while time.time() < end_time:
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(next(spinner))
            sys.stdout.flush()
            time.sleep(delay)
            sys.stdout.write('\b')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during sleep: {e}")
            return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Spinner for 5 seconds:")
    show_spinner(duration=5.0, delay=0.1)
    print("\nDone!")
```
