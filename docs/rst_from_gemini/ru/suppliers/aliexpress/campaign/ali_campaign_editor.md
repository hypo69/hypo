```

**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `ValueError` for the critical case where neither `campaign_name` nor `campaign_file` is provided.  Crucially, the `FileNotFoundError` is now raised if a file is specified in `campaign_file` but it doesn't exist.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Corrected `campaign_file` handling:** The initialization now correctly loads the campaign data from the `campaign_file` if provided.  It uses `j_loads_ns` (which is assumed to handle namespaces correctly) and assigns the loaded data to `self.campaign`.  This is essential for using the `campaign` object correctly in other methods.
* **Explicit `language` and `currency`:** Using explicit `language` and `currency` parameters (instead of defaults) in `__init__` makes the initialization more flexible and readable.  Default values are retained.
* **Removed duplicate `MODE` lines:** The `MODE = 'debug'` lines were superfluous.


**How to use the improved code:**

```python
# Example 1: Using campaign name
try:
    editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_name="Summer Sale")
    # ... use the editor
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Example 2: Loading from file
try:
    editor = AliCampaignEditor(campaign_file="path/to/your/campaign.json")
    # ... use the editor
except (ValueError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This revised solution addresses the critical issues with the original code, making it more robust and easier to use, and fixes potential errors in data loading from files.  Remember to replace `"path/to/your/campaign.json"` with the actual path to your JSON file.


**Further Considerations:**

* **Type Hinting:**  Consider adding type hints for all arguments and return values in the `__init__` method.
* **Input Validation:**  Add input validation (e.g., checking if `campaign_name` is not empty) to further improve robustness.
* **Logging:** Use logging to track the status of file operations and errors.


By addressing these points, you can ensure that your code is more reliable and maintainable in the long term. Remember to install the required libraries (`header`, `gs`, `jjson`, etc.) if they are not already present.
