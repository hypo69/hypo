```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Mocking `settings.json`:** The `create_settings_json` function now creates a temporary `settings.json` file for testing, which is critical for isolating tests and avoiding interference between runs. The `settings_file` fixture takes care of cleanup.

2.  **`pytest.raises` for Error Handling:**  The code now includes tests specifically for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` using `pytest.raises`. This demonstrates proper exception handling.

3.  **Parameterization (using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`)**: The `test_set_project_root_marker_types` function now uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for more concise and readable test cases, covering a variety of inputs. This is a cleaner and more efficient way to test different marker file types.

4.  **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

5.  **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The tests now use `tmp_path` fixture for temporary directory creation, which is essential for isolating tests and avoiding conflicts.  

6. **Edge Case Testing**: Added tests for cases like empty `marker_files` tuple,  a marker file that's a directory, and invalid data type for marker files.

7. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Now has more tests for different scenarios including valid input, cases where the file is already in `sys.path`, multiple marker files, and nested directories.

8. **Removed Unnecessary Code:** The code now removes the unnecessary `__root__` and `MODE` variables (from the original code) as these are not needed or used in testing or for verifying the function's core logic.  The `from src import gs` statement also is commented out as it's not needed for testing `set_project_root` directly.


This improved solution provides a more robust and comprehensive set of tests for the `set_project_root` function, ensuring that it handles various inputs and edge cases correctly. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.  Also, make sure you have the `hypotez` project structure in place for the `src` imports to work.
