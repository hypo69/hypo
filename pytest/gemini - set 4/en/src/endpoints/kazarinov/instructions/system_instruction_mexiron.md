```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `build_computer` function now includes checks for invalid input types (not a list or not a dictionary). It returns `None` if the input is malformed, allowing the calling code to handle these situations appropriately.  Crucially, it also verifies that all required keys ("product_id", "product_title", "product_description") exist in each component dictionary.

2. **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided test cases are expanded to include scenarios with valid input, and more importantly, with invalid and edge case input, reflecting the function's expected behavior with various kinds of input data.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive.

4. **pytest.raises (Not Needed):**   Since the function returns `None` for invalid input, you don't need `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions because the function itself already handles the validation logic.

5. **Fixtures (Not Needed Here):**  No fixtures are needed for this simple function.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_computer_builder.py`).
2.  Run the tests using pytest:
    ```bash
    pytest test_computer_builder.py
    ```

**Further Improvements:**

*   **Translation:**  The `build_computer` function currently just copies the input data; it needs to actually *translate* the `product_title` and `product_description` using a translation API (e.g., Google Translate).
*   **Build Type Logic:** The current `build_types` calculation is trivial; you should implement a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the specifications of the components to determine the build type more accurately.
*   **More Robust Tests:** Add more test cases for edge cases, like components with unusual types of data, empty strings for titles or descriptions, etc. Add tests for cases with a single component, an array of multiple components, etc.


Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
