How to use the PrestaWarehouse class
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a class `PrestaWarehouse` which inherits from the `PrestaShop` class.  It likely represents a class for interacting with a PrestaShop warehouse, providing methods for accessing and managing warehouse data within a PrestaShop store. The `...` indicates that there are likely additional methods within the class not shown in the snippet.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary libraries, including `os`, `sys`, `attr`, `pathlib`, custom modules like `header`, `gs`, `printer`, and `PrestaShop` from a specified location (`src`).  It also imports the `logger` from a `src` submodule. This sets up the environment for interacting with the PrestaShop API and potentially handling file system operations.
2. It defines a `PrestaWarehouse` class inheriting from a `PrestaShop` class. This inheritance suggests a structure where `PrestaShop` contains basic functionalities for interacting with the PrestaShop API, and `PrestaWarehouse` builds on top of these for warehouse-specific tasks.
3. The code initializes a `MODE` variable with the string 'dev', likely for development or testing purposes.
4. The class `PrestaWarehouse` is defined, but no methods are implemented in this snippet.  This means you would need to refer to the `PrestaShop` class and its methods for the actual functionality of interacting with the PrestaShop API.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example assumes PrestaShop and necessary modules are defined and imported
    # You would need to create an instance of PrestaShop and set the appropriate credentials

    # ... (Import statements and setting up PrestaShop instance) ...

    warehouse_instance = PrestaWarehouse() # Create an instance of PrestaWarehouse


    # ... (Example calls to methods in PrestaWarehouse for warehouse operations) ...


    # Example method call (assuming a method exists to retrieve warehouse data):
    warehouse_data = warehouse_instance.get_warehouse_data(warehouse_id=123)
    if warehouse_data:
        pprint(warehouse_data)  # Pretty print the fetched warehouse data


    #  Example usage (assuming a method exists to update warehouse information)
    updated_warehouse_data = { "name": "New Warehouse Name" } # Example data
    success = warehouse_instance.update_warehouse_data(warehouse_id=123, data=updated_warehouse_data)
    if success:
      print("Warehouse updated successfully")
    else:
      print("Warehouse update failed.")
