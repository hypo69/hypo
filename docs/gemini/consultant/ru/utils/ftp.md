.. module:: src.utils
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

#Connection configuration (assumed to be defined elsewhere)
_connection = {'server': 'ftp.example.com', 'user': 'username', 'password': 'password', 'port': 21}
```

**Changes Made**

- Replaced `source_file_path` with more descriptive names like `destination_directory` and `destination_filename` to be consistent with the FTP context.
- Replaced the `MODE` variable with the connection details within `_connection` for better organization.
- Removed unnecessary `pathlib` import as it wasn't used.
- Added `try...except` blocks for better error handling with specific error types and logging using `logger.error`.
- Added explicit `FileNotFoundError` handling in `write`.
- Improved docstrings using reStructuredText format (RST) to clearly document parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- Renamed `delete` function to `delete_file` for clarity.
