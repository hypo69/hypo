.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

**Changes Made**

- Added import statements for `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` (as instructed).
- Improved error handling.  Used `logger.error` for various exceptions and more descriptive error messages.  Removed unnecessary `...` placeholders.
- Added more informative docstrings (reStructuredText) following RST guidelines and added type hints.
- Added `raise_for_status()` to the `aiohttp.ClientSession` for checking HTTP response codes.
- Implemented proper file creation/existence checks, preventing potential errors.
- Added checks for empty files after saving.
- Replaced `logger.critical` with `logger.error` where appropriate; `logger.critical` should be reserved for truly critical errors.
- Made error messages more specific.
- Removed redundant comments and improved formatting for clarity.
