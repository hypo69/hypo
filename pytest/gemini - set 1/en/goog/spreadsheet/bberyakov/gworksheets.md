**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to mock the `Spreadsheet` and `GSRender` objects.  This is essential for testing the `GWorksheet` class without relying on external dependencies.  The `mock_spreadsheet` fixture sets up the necessary mocks.
* **Clearer Error Handling:** The `test_gworksheet_get_nonexistent_worksheet` now uses `pytest.raises` to assert that an `AttributeError` with a specific message is raised if the worksheet doesn't exist, providing better feedback.
* **Assertions for `GWorksheet` attributes:** Added `assert` statements in `test_gworksheet_init` and other tests to validate that the `sh`, `ws`, and `render` attributes are set correctly after instantiation.
* **Assertions for method calls on the mock objects:**  Crucially, tests like `test_gworksheet_get_new_worksheet` and `test_gworksheet_get_existing_worksheet` now use `assert_called_once_with` to verify that the expected methods on the mock `Spreadsheet` objects are called with the correct arguments.  This is critical for testing that the interactions with the mock are as expected.
* **Realistic `mock_gsh.worksheets` fixture**:
   * This now returns an empty list initially.
   * The test for an existing worksheet now properly simulates an existing worksheet (e.g., `test_gworksheet_get_existing_worksheet`) by adding a mock `Worksheet` to the list of worksheets.


This revised solution provides much more robust and accurate tests by isolating the `GWorksheet` class and verifying its interactions with the mocked dependencies. Remember to adapt the error messages and assertions to match the expected behavior of the real `Spreadsheet` and `GSRender` classes in your actual application.  Also, add more tests covering various scenarios of `GWorksheet.get` function to test handling of `rows`, `cols`, and other parameters.


Important Note: Replace `hypotez.src.goog.spreadsheet.bberyakov.gworksheets` with the actual path to your module if it's in a different location.
