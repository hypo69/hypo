**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **Realistic Placeholders:** The previous response had placeholders like `"This is a valid input"`.  This revised code now includes _example_ valid inputs and _example_ expected outputs.  Crucially,  you *must* replace these with the *actual* input and expected output values for your `small_talk_bot`, `code_assistant`, and `psychologist_bot` functions.

2. **Exception Handling:**  The `test_code_assistant_invalid_input` now demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions. This is vital for testing robustness.  `test_psychologist_bot_empty_input` also includes expected exception handling.

3. **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  The test function names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

4. **Edge Cases:**  The tests now include a test for empty input, a vital edge case for most functions.  

5. **Specific Error Messages:**  The error messages in exception tests are more informative (e.g., "Invalid code input" instead of a generic exception message).


**How to Use/Adapt These Tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Update the placeholder values (e.g., `user_input`, `expected_output`) with actual data from your `hypo69` module.  This includes sample user inputs, expected responses from the bots, and input that would cause errors.

2. **Import Correct Modules:**  Ensure that you have the correct import statements at the top of the file for your modules.  It's usually `from src.endpoints.hypo69 import function_name`.

3. **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests from your terminal: `pytest -v`

4. **Expand as Needed:**  Add more tests to cover different types of valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and special scenarios for each function in `hypo69`.


**Crucially**:  This code is only a _starting point_. You must know the exact behavior of your Python functions to write accurate and effective tests.  You need to understand what valid input produces what output, and which types of input are expected to cause errors or specific exceptions.
