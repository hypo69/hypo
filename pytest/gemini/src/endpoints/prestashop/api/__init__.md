# Replace the placeholders with the appropriate names and error messages from your actual code

```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Methods:** The example tests now include placeholders (`ps.get_products(limit=10)`) where you must insert the actual method calls and data handling from your `PrestaShop` class. This is a critical step; without specific methods, the tests are incomplete.

2. **`pytest.raises`:**  Used correctly to test exceptions, checking for the correct exception type and error message.

3. **`pytest.mark.parametrize`:** Added parameterization for testing different modes (e.g., "dev", "prod") to make the tests more comprehensive.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Added more specific assertions to verify the expected behavior of the methods.  You must adapt these assertions to match the actual output of your methods. For example, if `get_products` is supposed to return a list of dictionaries, check that.


5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Input:** Included tests for various edge cases and invalid limits to ensure the code handles such situations gracefully.  Test with boundary conditions, like the minimum/maximum allowed limits, or when a limit of 0 is expected.


6. **Realistic Data:** The tests now check for the correct type of data (e.g., `isinstance(products, list)`). If your methods return a list of dictionaries, adjust the assertions accordingly.

**How to use it:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Substitute the example method calls (`ps.get_products()`) with the actual method calls from your `PrestaShop` class.  Provide realistic data to test the function with.

2. **Adapt assertions:** Modify the assertions in each test to check for the expected return values and data types based on your actual API function implementations.

3. **Add more tests:**  Expand this testing suite with tests for other methods, error handling, invalid input scenarios, etc.


This significantly improved example provides a better template for building comprehensive `pytest` tests for your `PrestaShop` class. Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific behavior and expected output of your code. Remember that proper testing involves extensive consideration of various input possibilities, including unusual and unexpected ones.  This ensures your code handles a wider range of scenarios correctly. Always verify that your `PrestaShop` class actually returns the expected values and data types.
