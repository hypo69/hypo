How to use the src.endpoints.advertisement module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This module initializes the advertisement endpoint.  It currently defines a global constant `MODE` with a value of 'dev', and imports the Facebook advertisement class from the `facebook` submodule.  This implies it's likely part of a larger system for handling advertisements, probably via a Facebook API.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The module sets the global constant `MODE` to the string 'dev'.  This likely represents the operational mode (e.g., development, testing, production).
2. It imports the `Facebook` class from the `.facebook` submodule. This implies that the `Facebook` class is defined and contains the logic for interacting with Facebook's advertisement API.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement as advertisement

    # Access the mode
    print(advertisement.MODE)

    # Example usage (requires you to have a Facebook class implementation)
    # Assuming you have initialized a Facebook instance:
    # facebook_instance = advertisement.Facebook(...)

    # Now, you can use facebook_instance for interactions with the Facebook advertisement API
    # For example:
    # advertisement_response = facebook_instance.create_ad_campaign(...)
    # print(advertisement_response)
