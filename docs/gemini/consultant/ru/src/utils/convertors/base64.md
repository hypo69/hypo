```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Replaced `# ...` with appropriate error handling using `try...except` and `logger.error`.
- Added detailed docstrings in RST format for both functions, including type hints (`content: str`, `file_name: str`, `image_path: str`).
- Improved variable names for clarity.
- Modified return type of `base64_to_tmpfile` to `str | None` to explicitly handle possible errors.
- Added `ValueError` and `FileNotFoundError` to `base64encode`'s `raises` section to specify expected exceptions.
- Improved docstring to provide more informative messages, parameter types, return types, and error handling.
- Corrected RST formatting in the module docstring.
