**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Placeholder Tests:** The example tests are now *significantly* improved placeholders.  They demonStarte the structure you should use for different test scenarios (valid input, exception handling, empty input).
* **`pytest.raises`:**  The `test_function_that_raises_exception` example demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions.
* **Fixtures:** The `example_data` fixture shows how you would supply test data.  Crucially, you need to define fixtures for your functions. If your functions need arguments, the fixture should produce them.
* **Error Handling:**  The `test_empty_input_check` shows the appropriate way to handle potential errors. It now uses `try...except` to specifically catch `TypeError` and reports failure if an incorrect type of exception is raised.

**How to adapt these tests:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Identify the actual functions, methods, or classes in your `prestashop` code that need testing. Replace `some_function`, `example_data`, `expected_result`, and `some_function_that_raises_exception` with the correct names.
2. **Define inputs/expected outputs:** For each test, determine the valid inputs and expected outputs. This is crucial. If a function returns a value, make an assertion to verify it.  If it raises an error, you *must* use `pytest.raises`.
3. **Edge cases:** Consider scenarios that the code may not have been designed to handle, like very large numbers, empty input, boundary conditions, or invalid data types.


**Critical Note:** The provided code is almost entirely documentation, not code to run or test.  To write meaningful tests, you must have functions and classes, not just comments.  The placeholders given here show the structure; you need to replace the placeholder functions with your actual functions.
