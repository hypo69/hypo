This Python script interacts with the Google Apps Script API to create a new script project, upload code files, and display the project URL.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Google Cloud Platform Project:** You need a Google Cloud Platform project.
*   **Service Account Credentials:** Create a service account key with the `script.projects` scope.  Save the JSON file as `credentials.json` in the same directory as this script.
*   **Virtual Environment:** Ensure you have a virtual environment activated (`venv/Scripts/python.exe` or `venv/bin/python/python3.12`)


**How to use:**

1.  **Install Required Libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    ```

2.  **Place `credentials.json`:**  Make sure the `credentials.json` file, containing your service account credentials, is in the same directory as the `quickstart.py` file.

3.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python quickstart.py
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   **Authentication:** The script retrieves or generates credentials to authenticate with the Google Apps Script API. It checks for a pre-existing `token.json` file. If it exists, it uses those credentials; otherwise, it prompts you to authorize the application. The credentials are then saved to `token.json`. This avoids repeated authorization requests.

*   **`SCOPES` Variable:** This list defines the permissions the script needs from your Google account.

*   **`SAMPLE_CODE` and `SAMPLE_MANIFEST`:**  These variables hold example code and manifest data to be uploaded to the script project.

*   **`main()` Function:** This is the core logic:
    *   It builds the Google Apps Script API service.
    *   Creates a new script project using `service.projects().create()`.
    *   Updates the project content with the sample code and manifest using `service.projects().updateContent()`.  Crucially, it uses the `scriptId` from the creation step to target the correct project.
    *   Prints the generated script URL.
    *   Handles potential `HttpError` exceptions during API calls to gracefully catch and display any error messages.

*   **`gs` and `header` modules (Important):** The code uses `gs` and `header` modules. These are likely custom modules within your project. Ensure these modules are correctly defined and accessible.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block catches potential `HttpError` exceptions from the API. This helps you diagnose problems and avoids crashes.

**Example Output (successful execution):**


```
https://script.google.com/d/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/edit
```

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **`credentials.json` missing:**  Double-check that `credentials.json` exists in the correct location.
*   **Authentication Issues:** Verify the service account's permissions include `script.projects`. If the authorization flow fails, double-check your network connection and ensure your Google account has necessary permissions.
*   **Module Errors:** If you encounter errors related to `gs` or `header`, make sure these modules are correctly imported and defined within your project.  Provide the relevant code for those modules if you need help.
*   **Incorrect `SCOPES`:** Ensure the `SCOPES` list is accurate for the required permissions.
