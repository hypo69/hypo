How to file issues and get help
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This section details how to file bug reports and feature requests, and how to obtain assistance using the TinyTroupe project.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Search existing issues:** Before filing a new issue, thoroughly search the existing GitHub issues to ensure that your problem or request hasn't already been addressed.  This helps prevent redundant reports.
2. **File a new issue (bug/feature request):** If no matching issue is found, create a new GitHub issue describing the bug or requested feature in detail.
3. **Consult the Wiki:** For general help and questions regarding using the project, first consult the project's Wiki for answers.
4. **Post on the Discussion forum:** If the Wiki doesn't provide a solution, post your question on the project's Discussion forum.  Both resources are available directly on GitHub.
