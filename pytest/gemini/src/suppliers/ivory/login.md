**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code has no functions, so placeholder tests using `pytest.raises` and assertions demonstrate the correct structure and approach. **Crucially, these are *example* tests. You must replace them with tests that actually address functions in your `login.py` file.**

2. **Error Handling:** The example tests now demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) and their messages, a critical part of robust testing.

3. **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are used to verify expected behavior (e.g., `assert "Invalid credentials" in str(excinfo.value)`).

4. **Meaningful Test Names:** Test names like `test_login_valid_credentials`, `test_login_invalid_credentials` are descriptive and indicate the purpose of the test.

5. **Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs:** The examples include tests for missing/empty username/password, and example long usernames (max length).

6. **Robustness:**  The tests ensure that the function responds correctly to a variety of potential inputs.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Remove the example tests and replace them with tests that specifically address the functions/methods defined in your `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/login.py` file.

2. **Run Tests:**  Save the file (e.g., `test_login.py`) and run `pytest test_login.py` in your terminal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Specific Error Messages:**  Always check for precise error messages to ensure the test is catching the *correct* failure.
* **Input Validation:** If your `login` function has input validation checks, test them to ensure they function properly.
* **Fixtures:** If your `login` function needs external data (e.g., database connection, file paths), use pytest fixtures to provide that data in a controlled manner within your tests.

Remember to provide the actual code within your `login.py` file for accurate test creation.  This example demonstrates the structure and best practices for `pytest` testing; adapt it to your specific code.
