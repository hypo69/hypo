**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** The `tmp_project_root` fixture is crucial for creating a controlled environment for testing. It ensures that the files needed by `set_project_root` are present in the correct location.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests cover valid input, when no marker files are found, and scenarios where files are in parent directories.  Crucially, I've added tests for error cases.
* **Error Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used correctly to test `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions, verifying that the code handles missing or malformed files.
* **Clear Test Names:** Descriptive test names make it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Isolation:** Each test function is independent, ensuring that failures in one test don't affect others.
* **Edge Cases:** The code now tests for edge cases (e.g., no marker files, files in parent directories).


**Before Running the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Adjust the test directory:** Make sure the tests are in the same directory as `header.py`.

3.  **Update imports:** If `gs` is not already imported, add necessary imports for your `gs` module.


This improved solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage, handling various scenarios and potential errors that may occur during runtime.  Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the tests that concern `gs`, `settings`, and `doc_str` with the actual calls to those parts of your code.
