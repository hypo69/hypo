# Important:  Remember to replace the placeholder locators and error messages
# in the mocks with your actual locator strings and error handling logic.
# Also, replace the placeholder 'Exception' if necessary with the
# specific exception the function should raise when a locator is not found.

# Remember to mock the selenium webdriver methods, like get_url and execute_locator.
#  This is critical for isolating tests and ensuring they don't rely on actual interactions with a browser.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The crucial improvement is mocking the `selenium.webdriver` methods (`get_url`, `execute_locator`).  This prevents your tests from actually interacting with a browser, which makes them much faster, more reliable, and avoids flakiness due to external factors.  The code now uses a `Supplier` class mock and mocks the locators to trigger the expected exception.

2. **Specific Exceptions:** The `pytest.raises` context now catches more specific exceptions. You *must* replace the `Exception` with the actual exception the `login` function should raise when a locator is not found.

3. **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages in the tests now check for specific error strings that should be raised when a locator isn't found. This makes debugging easier.


4. **Valid Input Test:** Added a test for valid input (with the mock supplier).  This checks if the `login` function at least returns the expected value (True in this case). This is vital to demonstrate that the function *executes* successfully.

5. **Fixture for Supplier:** Created a `supplier` fixture to provide the `Supplier` instance. This makes the tests more organized and reusable.

6. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests cover missing email/password/login button locators, providing comprehensive exception handling.

7. **Adaptability:**  The test setup now is highly adaptable, requiring only updates to the `locators` within the `Supplier` class (and any `execute_locator` logic) to target different elements.

**How to Use with Selenium (and adapt to your real code):**


```python
# Example of how to connect to a real browser (not part of the test)

# Install the necessary Selenium driver for your browser
# e.g.,  `pip install selenium webdriver-manager`
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# ... (rest of your code)

def test_login_real_browser(supplier):  # Use the supplier fixture
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions() # Add options for your browser here if necessary
    service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
    supplier.driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)
    # ... (The rest of your login function test code)
```

Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `selenium`, `webdriver-manager` (for managing the browser driver).


**Before running the tests:**

-  Replace placeholders like `"missing_locator"` with the actual locator values or strings you are using to find the elements.
-  Ensure you are correctly mocking the `execute_locator` method in the test cases to return `False` for the relevant elements.  Replace the `Exception` in `pytest.raises` with the actual exception type raised in your code.  If your code doesn't raise exceptions for these situations, this is a fundamental error you need to address first.
