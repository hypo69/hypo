**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints for `get_project_root` function.
- Changed `json.load` to `gs.j_loads` for better JSON handling.
- Added `logging` for error handling during file reading. More robust exception handling.
- Added a `Settings` class using Pydantic for validating and parsing settings data.
- Improved error handling (using `try-except` blocks) for both settings and README loading.
- Corrected some naming conventions.  (e.g., `cofee_link` instead of `__cofee__`)
- Added more descriptive comments.
- Added import `from src import gs` if it's not already present.
- Corrected `copyright` variable name.
- Using better error handling, now logging is added for more descriptive messages.
- Now, handling possible errors during README parsing more generally using `except Exception as e`.
- More robust handling of settings loading: if no settings file or error during parsing, default values are used.
- PEP8 style fixes.
