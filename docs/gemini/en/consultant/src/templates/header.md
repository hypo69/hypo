# Changes Made

*   Added type hints to the `set_project_root` function.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.  Import added to handle json loading.
*   Added missing import `from pathlib import Path`
*   Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` to correctly use external libraries
*   Added RST-style docstrings for the `set_project_root` function and module-level docstring.
*   Improved variable names (e.g., `__root__` to `project_root`).
*   Fixed the use of f-strings, and made sure that all variables are clearly named and type-hinted.
*   Improved clarity and conciseness of comments and docstrings.
