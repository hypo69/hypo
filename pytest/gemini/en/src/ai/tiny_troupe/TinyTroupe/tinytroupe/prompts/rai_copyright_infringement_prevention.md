**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock Function:**  The code now includes a `handle_request` function to simulate the actual function that would process the user's input.  This is crucial because you likely don't want to call out to external services (like accessing a specific web page) in your tests.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Tests now have clear expected responses, which makes debugging easier.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Tests cover various types of copyrighted material (books, lyrics, recipes, news articles, and WebMD).

4. **Edge Cases:** The tests now include more scenarios, including requests where the copyrighted material is explicitly mentioned.

5. **`pytest.raises` (Not Needed):**  The provided code doesn't have any error handling to test.  If there was a way to cause an error in the function, you could use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.

6. **Fixtures (Not Needed):** Since there is no data to be provided to the function, fixtures are not needed.

7. **Realistic Responses:** The expected responses now reflect a more helpful and polite way of refusing copyrighted material, explaining the reason.


**How to Use:**

1. Replace the placeholder `handle_request` function with your actual implementation.
2. Run `pytest` from your terminal in the same directory as your test file.

This revised solution provides a more complete and robust set of test cases that will help you verify the functionality and behavior of your copyright infringement prevention code in a more controlled manner. Remember to adjust the tests according to the specific logic and structure of your actual function. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
