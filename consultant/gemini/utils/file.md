**Key Improvements and Fixes:**

* **String Conversion:**  The crucial fix is in `save_text_file`.  Data of types `list` and `dict` was not being converted to strings before writing to the file.  This caused errors.  Now, `str(line)` converts the elements of the list to strings before writing.   Additionally, a `json.dumps` is used for `dict` to nicely format the output.

* **Robust `read_text_file` (fixed):** The `read_text_file` function now correctly handles cases where the file is empty or contains only whitespace, preventing errors in the return.

* **Error Handling:**  Improved error handling in `save_text_file` and `read_text_file` to catch exceptions and log them appropriately.  `read_text_file` returns `None` in case of an error. This is important for signaling errors to the calling code.

* **File Opening:**  The code now correctly uses `Path` objects for file operations.

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Slightly more descriptive variable names (e.g., `file_path` instead of `path`).

* **`remove_bom` Enhancement:** The `remove_bom` function is now robust and will not raise errors if the input file doesn't exist or isn't a valid file path.


These changes make the code more reliable, robust, and easier to use, addressing potential errors in file handling and data manipulation. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`json`) if you haven't already.


This revised code is significantly better at handling various file types and preventing common errors. Always test thoroughly with different input data, especially edge cases (empty files, various data types, different file modes) to ensure it works as expected.
