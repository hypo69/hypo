How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block defines a module `src.endpoints.prestashop.domains` in a Python file.  It sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'. This module likely serves as a configuration or initialization point for other parts of the codebase, specifically related to PrestaShop endpoints and domains. The presence of multiple docstrings suggests that the module, and likely some of the content it contains, is designed for documentation purposes (using Sphinx).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The module defines a variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value `'dev'` to it.  This variable likely controls the operational mode (e.g., development, staging, production) for the PrestaShop endpoints.
2. The code contains several multiline strings (docstrings) that serve as documentation for the module and likely for functions or classes that will be within this module. These docstrings explain the purpose and platform compatibility of the module and its parts.
3. The module likely imports and utilizes other modules which are not present in the given code snippet.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a placeholder for example usage, as the code snippet itself does not contain usage code.
    # Assuming there are functions and classes within src.endpoints.prestashop.domains that can use the 'MODE' variable.
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains import MODE

    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
    else:
        print("Running in another mode.")
