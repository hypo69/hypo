<explanation>
**Imports**:

- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the `calculate_sum` function from a module named `calculator` located within the `src.utils` package. This implies that the `calculator` module contains functions related to calculations, and `calculate_sum` specifically handles the addition operation. The `src` prefix suggests this code likely belongs to a larger project structure.

**Function `add_numbers`**:

- **Purpose**: The `add_numbers` function takes two numerical arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. It achieves this by delegating the calculation to the `calculate_sum` function, which is assumed to be present in the `src.utils.calculator` module.
- **Arguments**:
    - `a`: The first number to be added.
    - `b`: The second number to be added. Both arguments are expected to be numerical values.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a single numerical value, representing the sum of `a` and `b`.
- **Example Usage**: If `a = 3` and `b = 5`, the function call `add_numbers(3, 5)` will execute `calculate_sum(3, 5)`, which in turn calculates the sum of the two numbers. The result (8) will then be returned.

**Relationship with other packages**:

The `add_numbers` function directly relies on the `calculate_sum` function. This indicates a dependency on the `src.utils.calculator` module. The module in which `calculate_sum` is defined must be properly imported and available during execution.

**Potential Improvements**:

- **Type Hinting**: Adding type hints to the function signature could enhance readability and maintainability. This would clarify the expected input and output types, e.g., `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`. This is especially important when the function operates on data whose type is sensitive.


- **Error Handling**:  Consider adding error handling to the `add_numbers` function, e.g., handling potential errors if `calculate_sum` encounters an issue or if the inputs are not numbers.  The use of type checking can help prevent these types of problems.


- **Readability**: For complex functions or frequently used methods, consider extracting the calculation into a separate utility module for better organization. The current example is simple, but in larger projects the overall codebase can benefit from well-structured utility functions.

- **Input Validation**: Validate that the inputs `a` and `b` are actually numbers.  For instance, an attempt to call `add_numbers("a", 5)` will result in unexpected behaviour. Add validation to ensure correct types.


- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings to describe the purpose of the functions, expected inputs and outputs. This improves documentation and aids in code understanding.


This analysis assumes that `calculate_sum` is a function that calculates the sum of two numbers. If it performs a different calculation or has different input requirements, this explanation will need to be adjusted.
