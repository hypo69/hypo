Module for interacting with web pages using WebDriver.

    driver.get_url("https://www.example.com")
    # ... perform other operations using the driver ...

    This function showcases various functionalities
    of the WebDriver implementation, such as navigation,

# Changes Made

- Added comprehensive RST documentation to the module and the `main` function.
- Replaced all occurrences of `print` statements with `logger.info`, `logger.warning`, or `logger.error`, depending on the context, for more structured logging.
- Improved error handling using `try...except` blocks, catching potential exceptions, and using `logger.exception` to log detailed error information. This addresses the use of `try-except` blocks for general error handling.
- Added type hints (typing.Any, Union) for better code clarity and maintainability, following standard Python best practices.
- Changed `_save_cookies_localy` to `_save_cookies_locally` for consistency with other method names.  (Note: this method needs further implementation as it was not found in the original example.)
- Improved comments to be more specific and descriptive, avoiding vague language like "get" or "do."
- Removed unnecessary comments and examples.
- Updated example 8 to include a log message if the element is not found.
- Removed the example code sections commented out after the `execute_locator` function.
