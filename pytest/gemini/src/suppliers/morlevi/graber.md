```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver`, `Context`, `save_png`, and `logger` objects. This isolates the tests from the external dependencies, ensuring they run reliably and quickly.

2. **`@pytest.mark.asyncio`:**  Crucially, tests involving asynchronous functions (like `local_saved_image`) are now decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`. This tells pytest to run these tests using `asyncio.run` to properly execute the asynchronous operations.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:** Test names are more descriptive, and the tests now explicitly verify expected outcomes for both success and failure cases.

4. **Error Handling:** The `test_local_saved_image_failure` test now demonstrates how to properly use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions that might be raised during the `local_saved_image` function.

5. **Edge Case:** `test_local_saved_image_missing_id` covers the case where `id_product` is not set.

6. **No Image Data:** The `test_local_saved_image_no_image_data` checks how the function behaves when there's no image data to save.

7. **Import fixes:**  Correct imports (gs and other modules) are crucial for making the tests work correctly.

8. **Field Mocking**: The `mock_fields` fixture provides a mock for the `fields` attribute, allowing you to easily control its properties.

Remember to replace `"test_image.png"` with the actual path if it's different. Also, ensure that your `save_png` function correctly handles potential errors and returns appropriate values.  If `save_png` returns `None` on failure, you might need to adjust the assertions in the tests accordingly.


This significantly improved solution provides more comprehensive and robust test cases, addressing potential issues and edge cases, and uses mocks effectively to eliminate external dependencies and ensure test isolation. Remember to adapt these tests further based on the specific expected behavior and error handling of the `save_png` function and other external calls.
