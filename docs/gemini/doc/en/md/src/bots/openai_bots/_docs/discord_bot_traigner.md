# Discord Bot Trainer Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to train and interact with a language model through a Discord bot.  It outlines the commands and procedures for preparing training data, initiating training jobs, monitoring progress, testing the model, and using additional commands for managing data.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Ensure Bot is Running

Make sure your bot is running. You should see a message in your console indicating the bot is logged in.

```plaintext
Logged in as YourBotName#1234
```

### Step 2: Invite the Bot to Your Server

Ensure the bot is invited to your server with the necessary permissions to read messages and send messages.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Training Data

You can train the model using text data or files containing the training data.

1. **Training with Text Data:**
   Prepare a string of text data that you want to use for training.

2. **Training with a File:**
   Prepare a file containing the training data. Ensure the file is accessible on your local machine.


### Step 4: Use the Training Command

#### Method 1: Using Text Data Directly

1. In a Discord channel where the bot has access, type the following command:
   ```plaintext
   !train "Your training data here" positive=True
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !train "Sample training data" positive=True
   ```

#### Method 2: Uploading a File

1. Attach the file containing the training data in a message.
2. In the same message, type the following command and send:
   ```plaintext
   !train positive=True
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !train positive=True
   ```

The bot will save the file and start training the model with the provided data.

### Step 5: Monitor Training

After you send the training command, the bot should respond with a message indicating the status of the training job:

```plaintext
Model training started. Job ID: <job_id>
```

### Step 6: Verify Training Status

You can add additional commands to your bot to check the status of the training job if needed. This would typically involve querying the model object for job status.

### Step 7: Testing the Model

Once the model is trained, you can test it with the test command.

1. Prepare a JSON string of test data.
2. In a Discord channel where the bot has access, type the following command:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"test_key": "test_value"}
   ```
   Example:
   ```plaintext
   !test {"input": "Test input data"}
   ```

The bot will respond with the model's predictions.


### Step 8: Using Additional Commands

#### Archiving Files

```plaintext
!archive <directory_path>
```
Example:
```plaintext
!archive /path/to/directory
```

#### Selecting Dataset

```plaintext
!select_dataset <path_to_dir_positive> positive=True
```
Example:
```plaintext
!select_dataset /path/to/positive_data positive=True
```


## Summary

1. **Start Bot**: Ensure your bot is running.
2. **Invite Bot**: Make sure the bot is in your Discord server.
3. **Prepare Data**: Have your training data ready as text or in a file.
4. **Train Model**: Use the `!train` command with either text data or file attachment.
5. **Monitor Training**: Look for the bot's response about the training job status.
6. **Test Model**: Use the `!test` command with test data to verify model performance.
7. **Manage Data**: Use `!archive` and `!select_dataset` commands as needed.
