**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to mock the `Driver` class and the `execute_locator` method. This is crucial because the original code interacts with external resources (a web driver). Mocking isolates the tests and avoids the need for an actual web browser.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now accurately reflect the scenarios being tested (e.g., `test_post_title_success`, `test_post_title_failure`).
* **Edge Case Testing:**  A `test_post_event_title_failure` example demonstrates how to test for failures during individual steps within `post_event`. More comprehensive edge case testing is necessary depending on the expected behavior of the functions for different types of invalid or missing input.
* **`pytest.raises` (not needed in this example):**  Since the functions don't directly raise exceptions, `pytest.raises` is not applicable and is removed.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** Added more test cases that cover various scenarios (success, failure).  The tests now verify that the correct method is called on the mocked driver object.
* **Fixtures for Dependencies:** `mock_driver` and `mock_locator` fixtures create mock objects for testing.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each test function.
* **`mock_event` fixture:** Created a fixture to provide a `SimpleNamespace` object for `post_event` tests.  This is important as it allows you to test the different sections of the code.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **More Robust Mocking:**  For more complex functions involving multiple calls to external systems, more sophisticated mocking techniques may be required.
* **Error Handling:**  Test for different error scenarios the functions may encounter, such as network issues, timeouts, etc.
* **Data-Driven Tests:**  Consider using data-driven tests if you have a lot of different input scenarios to cover.
* **Integration Tests:**  For testing how the functions interact with each other, you might write integration tests that test the entire workflow of a system operation.
* **External Dependencies:** For the `post_event` function, you likely need to mock `gs`, `src.webdriver`, `src.utils`, `src.logger`, and the locator file. Mocking these is important for testing the function without external resources.



To run these tests:

1.  Install `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the test code and the code under test (`post_event.py`, etc.).
3.  Run `pytest` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.


Remember to replace placeholders like `'path/to/image.jpg'` with appropriate data in your tests.  Consider using test data factories (e.g., with `factory_boy`) to generate test data efficiently. Also, add necessary `import` statements if required.
