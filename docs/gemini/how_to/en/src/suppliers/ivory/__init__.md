## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/__init__.py`, is likely a module initialization file for a Python project.  It sets up the `ivory` supplier module within the `hypotez` project.

**Functionality:**

The `ivory` supplier module likely contains classes and functions for interacting with a particular data source or service (e.g., an API, database, or file system).  The `Graber` class, imported from `src.suppliers.ivory.graber`, is the central part of the supplier. It will probably contain the logic for retrieving and processing data.

**Key Elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This defines a global variable named `MODE` and assigns the string 'dev' to it.  This is likely used for configuration purposes, potentially distinguishing between development, testing, and production environments.  Different values for this variable might trigger different behaviors in the code.

* **`from .graber import Graber`:** This line imports the `Graber` class from the `graber.py` file within the `ivory` subdirectory. This makes the `Graber` class accessible within the `ivory` module.

**How to use:**

1. **Import the `Graber` class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory import Graber
```

2. **Instantiate a `Graber` object:**

```python
graber_instance = Graber()
```

3. **Call methods on the `Graber` object:**

   This is where the specific functionality of the `ivory` supplier will be utilized.  The `Graber` class is crucial for retrieving and manipulating the data.  The exact methods available will depend on the implementation in `graber.py`. Examples:

   ```python
   # Example 1 (assuming a method to fetch data):
   data = graber_instance.fetchData()

   # Example 2 (assuming a method to process data):
   processed_data = graber_instance.process_data(some_input)
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`graber.py`:** The actual implementation details of data retrieval, processing, and handling are contained in `graber.py`.  Refer to the documentation for that file for a complete understanding of how to use the `Graber` class effectively.

* **Error Handling:**  Adding robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) in the usage code is crucial to manage potential issues when interacting with external resources (e.g., network errors, database connection problems).

* **Environment Variables (Potential):** Depending on the implementation, environmental variables may need to be configured (e.g., database credentials, API keys) for proper operation.

* **Documentation:**  The `ivory` module and `graber.py` should have well-documented code using docstrings to explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions for each function and method.  This will significantly improve usability.


**Example `graber.py` (Illustrative):**

```python
# hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/graber.py

class Graber:
    def fetchData(self):
        # ... logic to fetch data from the source (e.g., API call) ...
        return fetched_data

    def process_data(self, some_input):
        # ... logic to process the data ...
        return processed_data
```

This guide provides a high-level overview.  Detailed information about specific methods and their parameters is available in the documentation for `graber.py`.
