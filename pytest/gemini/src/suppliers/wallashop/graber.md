**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` object and `logger`.  This is crucial for testing functions that interact with external dependencies (like webdrivers or databases) in isolation, preventing unexpected behavior or external calls.

2. **Fixtures:** `driver_fixture` and `graber_instance` fixtures are provided to create and manage the objects needed for your tests.

3. **Comprehensive Tests:**  The example tests are basic; you must replace the placeholders with your actual methods and their expected outputs and error conditions.  Include tests for the `Graber` class methods like `get_price()`, `get_name()`, etc., with valid and invalid data.  Crucially, you need test cases for the exception handling that is part of the decorator implementation if you have one (the original code had this commented out).

4. **Error Handling:** The example now shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.

5. **Parameterization (Optional):** Add `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to test multiple input scenarios for methods if necessary.

6. **Decorator Tests:** The commented-out decorator tests provide a template for testing this functionality once the implementation is uncommented.

7. **`logger` Mock:**  The mock `logger` is important for isolating your tests from the `logger`'s output.

**How to Use and Extend:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**  Change the example test functions to test your actual methods and their logic.
2. **Add tests:** Include tests for all important methods and edge cases.
3. **Add fixtures:**  Define fixtures for any other objects or dependencies used by your methods.
4. **Handle exceptions:** Use `pytest.raises` to verify how your methods handle errors or invalid inputs.


This revised solution provides a robust starting point for writing comprehensive `pytest` tests for your `Graber` class and is ready for expanding on those example tests. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functions and error handling in your `Graber` class. Remember to adjust the imports if necessary. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functions and error handling in your `Graber` class. Remember to un-comment out parts of the code related to the decorator if you intend to test that part of the code. Remember to replace the example `some_method` and expected results with your actual code and assertions. Remember to verify your logger statements when using the logger in your code.
