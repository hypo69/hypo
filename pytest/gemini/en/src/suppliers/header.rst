**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input` instead of just `test_set_project_root`.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover various scenarios, including no marker files, files in the parent directory, and the case where files are not found.
* **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The tests are designed to account for situations where the marker files might not exist or be in different directories.
* **Error Handling (Exception Testing):** The tests now use `pytest.raises` to specifically check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` as specified in the original code.
* **Mocking (`mock_settings_file` Fixture):** A `mock_settings_file` fixture is introduced to create and manage a temporary `settings.json` file for testing. This avoids creating or modifying files in the real project directory.
* **Cleanup:** The `teardown_module` function is added to remove the dummy files created for testing to prevent accidental interference with the test suite.  `missing_ok` is used to prevent errors if files aren't present.
* **Import Statements:** Added `from hypotez.src.suppliers.header import set_project_root`
* **More Robust `assert` Statements:** The `assert` statements now verify the expected types and values more comprehensively, improving test reliability.
* **File Existence Checks:** Explicitly checks if files exist within the tests.  Important to validate files were created/modified before assertions.


This revised solution is more robust, covers a wider range of scenarios, and is better structured for maintaining testability and preventing unintended side effects in subsequent tests. Remember to install the necessary packages: `pytest` and `packaging`.  Also, ensure the `gs` module is accessible in your test environment, as the original code uses it. Finally, adjust the paths in the tests (e.g., `__file__`) if you run the tests from a different location than the code under test.
