try_xpath_content.js
=======================

This JavaScript file implements the Try XPath extension's core logic for interacting with the browser and handling XPath queries.  It manages the display and manipulation of elements, frame navigation, and style updates.  The script listens for messages from the browser extension popup, executes XPath queries, and updates the browser's display accordingly.
