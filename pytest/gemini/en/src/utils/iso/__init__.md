**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided tests are placeholders because the input code doesn't contain any functions, methods, or classes.  Replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) and the placeholder `test_mode_not_defined` and `test_mode_not_string` with tests based on the *actual* functions you want to test in `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py`.

2. **Import from Correct Path:** The tests now correctly import from the specified path `hypotez.src.utils.iso`.  This is essential for proper testing.

3. **Clearer Test Function Names:** The test function names are more descriptive (`test_mode_is_set`, `test_mode_value`).

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:** The `test_invalid_mode_value` example demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions. Replace the example with relevant exception checks based on the code you're testing.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The added tests cover the existence and type of the `MODE` variable, and test the value itself.  You should expand these tests to thoroughly cover the functions within the module that `__init__.py` may be importing or invoking.  

6. **Error Handling:**  Crucially, the example tests now include `test_mode_not_defined` and `test_mode_not_string` which demonstrate correct error handling (raising `pytest.fail` rather than just a `ValueError` when testing if the variable should not have a certain type).

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_iso.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_iso.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file and the `hypotez/` directory.


**Key Next Steps:**

- **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder code (`# ...`) with actual tests for the functions and classes in your `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py` file.  
- **Add Fixtures:** If your functions require data or setup, create fixtures (using `@pytest.fixture`) to provide that data or perform setup tasks.
- **Thorough Testing:** Create more tests covering various cases for the functions (valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, error handling).  Don't forget exceptions!


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual test cases. Provide the code from `hypotez/src/utils/iso/__init__.py` to get more targeted and accurate test examples.
