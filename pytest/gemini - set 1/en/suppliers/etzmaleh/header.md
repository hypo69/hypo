```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `pytest.fixture` and `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `get_project_root`, `settings.json`, and `README.MD`. This is vital for testing functions that interact with files without relying on the actual file system, preventing unintended side effects and making the tests more reliable.
2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, reflecting the specific scenario being tested.
3. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** The tests now cover cases where marker files exist, cases where they don't, the `__root__` variable being added to `sys.path` , and cases where file not found exceptions are caught.
4. **Exception Handling:** The tests correctly handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.
5. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories and files, ensuring that tests don't interfere with each other.
6. **`mock_sys_path`:** The `mock_sys_path` fixture is used to control the value of `sys.path`.
7. **`MockGs` class:** Created a mock `gs` class to mock the `gs.path.root` attribute.  Crucially, the actual `import gs` is now included.
8. **Import statements:** Crucial imports are added to resolve the `gs` issue.
9. **`load_settings` and `load_docstring`:** The code defines functions to load settings and docstrings to allow for more controlled testing of the loading process.

**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure that the `hypotez.src.common.gs` and `hypotez.src.suppliers.etzmaleh.header` modules are in the correct paths.  Otherwise, your imports won't work. 
3. Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and realistic set of tests for the given code.  Remember to replace `"fake_project_root"` with the actual root path of your project if you want to test against a real project setup.   This will now test the logic within the functions, not just the file system.
