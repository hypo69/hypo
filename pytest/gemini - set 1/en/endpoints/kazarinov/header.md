**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Data Creation:** Added `mock_settings_file` and `mock_readme_file` fixtures. These create dummy `settings.json` and `README.MD` files within a temporary directory, making the tests more robust and avoiding relying on external files.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, like `test_get_project_root_valid_input`.
* **Edge Case Testing:**  The tests now explicitly check scenarios where the file isn't found or is in a parent directory.
* **Exception Handling:** While the original code handled exceptions, the tests now verify this behavior using `pytest.raises` which is the preferred method.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name).
3.  Ensure that the `hypotez` project is in a proper folder structure with the required files.

4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage and better demonStartes the expected behavior in various scenarios. Remember to adapt the fixture and test cases to reflect the actual file structure and expected behavior of your application. Remember to replace placeholders like `settings.json` and other file names with the actual file names in your project.  The example tests assume the folder structure matches the provided `kazarinov` header.py file. Also, replace  the `tmp_path` in the examples for using the fixture for the correct file structure.
