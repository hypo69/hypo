How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a module `gearbest` containing a single variable `MODE` and imports a class `Graber` from a submodule named `graber`.  The module is likely part of a larger system for interacting with the GearBest e-commerce platform. The `MODE` variable likely controls the operational mode (e.g., development, production). The `Graber` class is presumably responsible for retrieving data from the GearBest website.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code sets a variable `MODE` to the string value 'dev'. This likely sets the operational mode to development.
2. It imports the `Graber` class from the `graber` submodule within the `gearbest` module. This allows other parts of the system to use the `Graber` class. This likely implies the existence of the `graber.py` file in the same directory.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have the necessary import statements.
    # Also assumes graber.py exists with the Graber class.
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.gearbest import Graber

    # Create an instance of the Graber class.
    gearbest_graber = Graber()

    # Use the Graber object to retrieve data.  
    # (The specific usage depends on the implementation of the Graber class.)
    # For example:
    # product_data = gearbest_graber.get_product_details(product_id='12345')
    # if product_data:
    #     print(product_data)


**Important Considerations**:

- This usage example assumes the `Graber` class has methods like `get_product_details` to interact with the GearBest API.  You'll need to refer to the documentation for the `Graber` class (which would be in `graber.py`) to understand its API and the data it provides.
-  Error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) is crucial for robust code when interacting with external APIs, especially if the `Graber` class interacts with the GearBest API.
- The variable `MODE` likely is used in conditional logic elsewhere to determine behavior, such as choosing different data sources or setting up different connection parameters.
