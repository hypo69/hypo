**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Temporary Directory:** The crucial addition of a temporary directory (`TEMP_DIR`) and a `temp_file_setup` fixture. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other and that files are properly cleaned up after each test run.  This is essential for testing file-system-related functions.
* **Fixture for Setup:**  A `temp_file_setup` fixture is added to control the creation and removal of temporary files and directories.  This keeps test setup and teardown clean.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** More thorough testing of various scenarios, including cases where marker files aren't found, are in subdirectories, or are directories themselves.
* **Error Handling:**  While the original code has `try...except` blocks for file operations, the tests now ensure that the expected behavior is tested.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  The assertions are more specific and meaningful, making it easier to understand what the test is checking.
* **`pytest.raises` (NOT NEEDED):** The code doesn't raise exceptions under normal operation and does not require `pytest.raises`.  This has been removed to improve efficiency.
* **Cleanup:** Added `shutil.rmtree` in the `temp_file_setup` fixture to ensure the temporary directory and its contents are removed after each test run.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above test code in a file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
3.  Place `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` in the same directory as `test_logger.py`.
4.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_logger.py`


This significantly improves the quality and reliability of your tests, as they no longer rely on a potentially shared, non-temporary environment. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/logger/header.py"` with the actual file path if it's different. Also, remove the test code related to loading settings, as it was not part of the original function under test.
