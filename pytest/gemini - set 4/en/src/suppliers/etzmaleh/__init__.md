**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:** The code now correctly imports the `pytest` library.

2. **`Graber` Class Assumption:**  The tests now assume you have a `Graber` class within the `etzmaleh` module, which needs to be tested.   Crucially, the tests are now *generic* - they don't rely on specific methods or arguments.  You must adapt the examples to the methods your actual `Graber` class has.

3. **`test_graber_initialization`:**  A test for the initialization is included.  You'll need to add more assertions if the `Graber` class has attributes that should be initialized to a certain state.

4. **Example Tests for Methods (`get_data`):**  Example tests are included for `get_data`, but they are *placeholders* and **must be adapted**.  Replace the comments within the `test_graber_get_data_*` with the actual assertions relevant to your `get_data` method, like checking the type of returned data, its structure, or handling of errors.

5. **Exception Handling (`pytest.raises`):**  An example of how to use `pytest.raises` for testing exceptions has been added.  Again, this needs to be adapted to the specific error your `get_data` method throws.

6. **Edge Case and Empty Input:** Example tests for edge cases and empty input are given. Update them with the appropriate logic.

7. **`MODE` attribute Test:**  A test for the `MODE` attribute is provided, reflecting the provided code.


**How to use these tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the example comments and placeholders with your actual tests based on the methods and attributes of your `Graber` class.

2. **Define Fixtures (if needed):** If your methods require data as input, define appropriate fixtures to provide this data in a testable manner.

3. **Run Tests:** Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest`: `pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/etzmaleh/` (or the appropriate path to your test file).

4. **Adapt Errors:** Replace the example error messages with the actual error messages that your code raises.

5. **Adapt Assertions:** Replace the example assertions with the specific assertions required to validate the results of your `Graber` class methods.

Remember to provide the actual code for your `Graber` class, so that these tests can be fully adapted for your specific needs.
