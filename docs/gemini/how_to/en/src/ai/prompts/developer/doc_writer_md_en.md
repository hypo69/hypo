```python
# This module provides a class for interacting with AI models for code processing.
# It allows for processing code files, analyzing them, and potentially generating documentation.

# Example Usage (assuming a CodeAssistant class exists):
# ```python
# assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='en', model=['gemini'])
# assistant.process_files(files=['file1.py', 'file2.js'])
# ```

# Platforms:  Cross-platform (assumes compatibility with AI models on the target platform)
# Synopsis:  Provides an interface to process code files using AI models.

    The CodeAssistant class interacts with AI models (e.g., Google Gemini)
