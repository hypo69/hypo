How to use the `hypotez/src/suppliers/header.py` file

This file sets up the project environment, loads configuration, and defines important project metadata.  It's crucial for initializing your project and ensuring consistent access to resources.

**Key Functions and Variables:**

* **`set_project_root(marker_files=...)`:**  This function is the heart of project initialization. It searches up the directory tree from the current file (`__file__`) until it finds a directory containing any of the specified `marker_files`. These markers (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`) help identify the project's root.  Crucially, it adds the project root to `sys.path` to enable import of modules in subdirectories.
    * **`marker_files`:** A tuple of file/directory names to search for.  You should typically leave this as the default value.

* **`__root__`:** A `Path` object representing the absolute path to the project root directory.  This variable is *calculated* by calling `set_project_root()`.


* **`settings`:** A dictionary containing project settings loaded from `src/settings.json`.
    * **Error Handling:**  The code includes `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle cases where `settings.json` is missing or contains invalid JSON.


* **`doc_str`:**  Contains the text of the `README.MD` file in the `src` directory.
    * **Error Handling:**  Similar error handling to `settings` is present for the `README.MD` file.

* **`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`:** These variables hold metadata about the project.  They are populated using values from the `settings` dictionary. They provide a structured way to access these crucial values throughout your application, if needed. They default to specific values if `settings.json` is missing or invalid.



**How to use:**

1.  **Import the necessary parts:**
    ```python
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.header import __root__, __project_name__, __version__
    ```
2.  **Access the project root:**
    ```python
    # Example, accessing a file in the project root
    file_path = __root__ / "data" / "my_file.txt"
    ```
3.  **Access project metadata:**
    ```python
    project_name = __project_name__
    print(f"Project name: {project_name}")
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`settings.json`:** This file is crucial. Ensure it exists and contains a valid JSON structure with the expected keys (e.g., `project_name`, `version`).
* **`README.MD`:** The `README.MD` file is used for documentation. If this is not present it won't create an error, but you will not have a doc_str.

This `header.py` provides a robust way to locate the project root, handle potential errors, and access critical project information without relying on `os.path.abspath` or similar.  This is vital for maintaining consistent paths and reducing errors throughout your project.
