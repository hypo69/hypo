How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`).  It then adds this root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`). The code also loads settings from a `settings.json` file and project documentation from `README.MD` within the project root, if they exist. Finally, it extracts various project metadata (name, version, author, etc.) from the loaded settings or defaults to fallback values if the settings file is not found or the data is missing.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, and `packaging.version` modules.  This is essential for interacting with the file system, working with JSON data, and handling file paths.

2. **Define the `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names as input.

3. **Locate the project root:** It starts from the directory of the current file and iterates upwards, checking if any of the specified marker files exist in each parent directory.  The function keeps track of the current directory and the project root.

4. **Update `sys.path`:** If the project root is found, it adds the root directory to the `sys.path` list, making modules in the project directory accessible.

5. **Return the project root:** The function returns the `Path` object representing the project root directory.

6. **Get the project root:** The `__root__ = set_project_root()` line calls the function to get the project root and stores it in the `__root__` variable. This is crucial for properly accessing project-level resources.

7. **Load settings (settings.json):** It tries to load settings from `settings.json` located within the project's root directory. If the file is not found or there's an error in loading JSON, it proceeds without settings.

8. **Load documentation (README.MD):**  It attempts to load documentation from `README.MD` file in the project root. If the file is not found or the data cannot be loaded, it defaults to an empty string.

9. **Extract project metadata:** It retrieves project-specific details (name, version, author, etc.) from the loaded `settings` dictionary, with fallback values if the corresponding key doesn't exist or the settings dictionary is not available.

10. **Set variables:** It assigns the loaded values (or defaults) to variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.  These variables are likely used for later use in other parts of the application.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    # Create a dummy settings.json for demonstration
    settings_data = {
        "project_name": "MyProject",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "author": "John Doe"
    }
    with open("settings.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(settings_data, f, indent=4)


    # Create a dummy README.MD for demonstration
    readme_data = "This is my project's README"
    with open("README.MD", "w") as f:
        f.write(readme_data)


    #Ensure pyproject.toml exists
    with open("pyproject.toml", "w") as f:
      f.write("")


    # Example usage of the code
    from hypotez.src.ai.myai.header import set_project_root
    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")  # Accessing the metadata
    print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")


    # Clean up dummy files (optional)
    os.remove("settings.json")
    os.remove("README.MD")
    os.remove("pyproject.toml")
