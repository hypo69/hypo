**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now mocks `TinyWorld` and `Agent` classes. This isolates the tests from the actual implementation, making them independent and faster.  This is *essential* for unit testing.
* **Clearer Tests:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_run_empty_world`).
* **Specific Assertions:** Assertions are more specific, checking for expected values in the mock data.  This provides much better feedback if the test fails.
* **Edge Case Handling:** The `test_run_empty_world` now handles the case where the world has no agents.
* **Thorough Broadcast Test:** The `test_broadcast_message` now verifies that the correct part of the message was received.
* **Complete State Encoding/Decoding Test:** The test correctly checks for the important parts of the encoded state.
* **Robustness:** The `test_decode_complete_state` now correctly handles the case where the state has been modified.


**To Run These Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the above code as `test_tinyworld.py`.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_tinyworld.py
    ```

This revised solution demonstrates a more robust and comprehensive approach to testing using `pytest` fixtures, mocking, and specific assertions.  It adheres to the requirements and anticipates potential issues within the provided code. Remember that the tests would need to be adjusted if the internals of TinyWorld, or the mocking are different in the actual implementation.
