# hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py

## Overview

This module, `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py`, serves as an initialization file for the example scripts within the `openai` sub-module.  It currently defines a global variable `MODE` set to 'dev' and imports versioning information.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A global variable that controls the execution mode. Currently set to 'dev'.

**Type**: `str`

**Value**: `'dev'`



## Imports

### `packaging.version.Version`

**Description**: Imports the `Version` class from the `packaging.version` module, likely for version checking.

**Module**: `packaging.version`


### `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`

**Description**: Imports versioning information, likely from a dedicated `version.py` file within this same directory. The exact format and contents are not apparent in the provided code snippet.

**Module**: `.version`


## Module Docstrings

The module has several multiline docstrings, each starting with `"""..."""` and documented with `:platform`, `:synopsis` etc. tags. These are largely empty but serve to provide metadata about the module and sub-modules.  They are currently not directly reflected in the code body.  This is expected practice for Python documentation to allow for more detailed documentation without having to maintain the comments in the code itself.


This documentation does not show the content of the multiline docstrings because their contents are empty.



## Note

The presence of `` and similar lines at the top of the file suggest this might be a script or module intended for execution, and likely part of a larger project structure.  The imports and comments are common practice for software development.
