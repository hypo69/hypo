**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `shutil`:** Added `import shutil` for safely removing the temporary directories.  This was crucial for preventing issues in test runs.

2. **Robust Temporary Directory Setup:** The code now creates a proper temporary directory structure to test different scenarios. The original method created a file in the current working directory, which can interfere with other tests.

3. **`os.chdir()` for Testing:** The code changes the current working directory to the temporary directory to accurately simulate running the code from a project location.  Critically important for testing the `Path` operations.

4. **Error Handling:** This version includes a test specifically for the case where the marker files aren't found. It asserts that the current directory is returned in this situation.

5. **`shutil.rmtree`:** Using `shutil.rmtree` for cleaning up temporary directories is much safer than `os.remove` for a directory.


6. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive, like `test_set_project_root_valid_input()`.

7. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now cover a missing marker file in `test_set_project_root_missing_marker_files`, ensuring more thorough validation.  Also added a test case for the marker file located in a parent directory, as requested.

8. **Improved Cleanup:** Added `os.chdir(initial_dir)` and `shutil.rmtree` statements to restore the original working directory and remove the temporary directory after each test. This crucial step prevents test conflicts.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution is much more robust and ensures the tests accurately reflect the intended behavior of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/_examples/header.py"` with the actual path if it's different.


Remember to install the necessary packages (like `packaging`) if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install packaging pytest
```
