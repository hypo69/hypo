**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test names clearly indicate the input and expected behavior, making it easy to understand the purpose of each test.

2. **Specific Assertions:**  Instead of just checking for `None` or `True`, the tests now have more specific assertions based on the expected output.  Crucially, these examples need to be replaced with the *actual* expected behavior of the `Graber` class methods.

3. **Exception Handling with `pytest.raises`:** The `test_graber_method_invalid_input` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.  This is *essential* for robustness.

4. **Edge Case Handling:** The `test_graber_method_edge_case` example demonstrates how to test edge cases.  Adapt this to test actual edge cases for your data.

5. **Complete Test Structure:** The example structure includes initialization, valid input, invalid input, and edge case tests.  Adapt this to your specific code and needs.

6. **Missing Code:** The provided code `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/__init__.py` is incomplete.  It imports `Graber` but doesn't define any methods or functions.  You need to add the relevant parts of the `Graber` class and its methods for these tests to work.

**How to use this example:**

1. **Replace placeholders:** Replace `"valid_url"`, `"invalid_url"`, `"edge_case_url"`, and the comments with the actual method names, input data, expected outputs, and error messages from your code.

2. **Import correct modules:** Ensure you've correctly imported `pytest` and the `Graber` class from the correct path.

3. **Run tests:** Use `pytest` to run the test file: `pytest test_hb_supplier.py` (or the name of your test file).

This revised example provides a much stronger foundation for comprehensive and effective testing. Remember to adapt it to the specific structure and functionality of your `Graber` class. Also, please provide the complete `Graber` class definition for even more accurate testing suggestions. Remember that your assertion should relate to the method or functions' expected behaviour.
