```python
import pytest

# Tests for the __init__.py file
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks if the MODE constant is correctly set."""
    from hypotez.src.fast_api import MODE
    assert MODE == 'dev'

def test_mode_type():
    """Checks if the MODE constant is of the correct type."""
    from hypotez.src.fast_api import MODE
    assert isinstance(MODE, str)

# Additional tests (if other variables or functions exist in the file)
# Example (assuming a function exists named 'my_function')
# def test_my_function_valid_input(example_data):
#     """Checks correct behavior of my_function with valid input."""
#     result = my_function(example_data)
#     assert result == expected_output # Replace with actual expected output


# Example of a fixture (if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def example_data():
#     """Provides test data for the function."""
#     return {"key": "value"}


# Example of a test that checks for exceptions (if applicable)
# def test_function_raises_exception_on_invalid_input():
#     """Checks correct exception handling."""
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         my_function(invalid_input)
#     assert str(excinfo.value) == "Invalid input"


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test names (`test_mode_value`, `test_mode_type`) clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Direct Assertion:**  The tests directly assert the expected value of `MODE`.

3. **Type Checking:** The `test_mode_type` function now checks the type of `MODE` using `isinstance()`, which is more robust than just assuming the type.

4. **Structure:** The code is now organized into functions for each test case, improving readability and maintainability.

5. **Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each test function.

6. **Example with `pytest.raises`:** The example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the test code (e.g., `test_fast_api.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/fast_api/__init__.py` file.

2. **Run:** Open a terminal in that directory and run `pytest test_fast_api.py`.  Pytest will automatically discover and execute the test functions.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Code:** The provided `__init__.py` file is extremely simple.  If there were other functions or variables in the file, you'd need more tests to cover those parts.
* **Completeness:** The provided tests are minimal but address the provided code's specific functionality.  Thorough testing would require a more complete understanding of the `fast_api` module's behavior and the expected inputs/outputs for any other functions or variables it contains.
* **Fixtures:**  If your code needs to use fixtures (e.g., to prepare data or create objects), add them using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator as shown in the example.

This improved answer now provides a complete and correct example, and also includes comprehensive instructions on how to run the tests.  Remember to replace the example comments with the actual tests required for the code you want to test. Remember to update the import statements accordingly if the code changes or is in a different location.
