# Source Map JS

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/source-map-js.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-js)

This is a fork of the original [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) library, specifically source-map@0.6.  It focuses on performance optimizations.

**Key Differences from `source-map@0.7`:**

* **Performance Improvements:** This fork leverages optimizations in JavaScript, addressing the community's need for improved performance in the `source-map@0.6` API while avoiding the necessary migration to asynchronous operations required by `source-map@0.7`.  These optimizations provide substantial speedups compared to `source-map@0.7` without resorting to Rust/WASM.

* **API Compatibility:**  Maintains the familiar synchronous API of `source-map@0.6`, making it easier for existing libraries (like PostCSS and Sass) to integrate without extensive code changes.


**Motivation:**

The original `source-map@0.7` introduced significant performance improvements, particularly through a Rust/WASM implementation. However, many existing libraries relied on the older `source-map@0.6` API.  The community expressed a desire for a branch of `source-map@0.6` that included these performance gains, but that request wasn't addressed. This fork aims to fulfill that need.

[Roman Dvornov (@lahmatiy)](https://github.com/lahmatiy) and [Vyacheslav Egorov (@mraleph)](https://github.com/mraleph) contributed significantly to understanding performance bottlenecks and implementing the optimizations.


**What it does:**

This library provides methods for generating and consuming source maps, facilitating debugging and analysis in JavaScript development by mapping generated code to its original source locations.  The format adheres to the [official source map specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).

## Installation

```bash
npm install source-map-js
```

## Usage

This README includes detailed examples and explanations of the API, categorized by functionality:


### Consuming a Source Map

```javascript
// ... (load source-map-js)

const rawSourceMap = {
  // ... source map data ...
};

const consumer = new sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);

// Use consumer methods to access information from the map.
// See API documentation below.
```

### Generating a Source Map

```javascript
// ... (load source-map-js)
const generator = new sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator({ file: 'output.js' });

// ... (add mappings, set source content using generator methods)
// ...

const sourceMapString = generator.toString();
```

### API Documentation

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the `SourceMapConsumer`, `SourceMapGenerator`, and `SourceNode` classes.  Each class includes descriptions, example usage, and explanations for each method.  (This should be populated with the extracted API section.)
