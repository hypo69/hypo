# Changes Made

*   Added missing `import` statements for `Path`, `Version`, `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`, and `logger` from `src.logger`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for file reading.
*   Added detailed docstrings in RST format to functions, variables, and the module itself, adhering to Sphinx standards.
*   Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of standard `try-except` blocks.
*   Removed unnecessary comments, corrected variable names, and added explicit type hints where applicable.
*   Improved comment clarity and replaced vague terms like 'get' with specific actions.
*   Created a dedicated `get_project_settings` function for better organization and readability.
*   Added a new `get_readme_content` function to handle README retrieval.
*   Improved variable naming for better clarity (e.g., `project_root` instead of `__root__`).
*   Added `:raises` sections to docstrings for clarity on potential exceptions.
*   Added `project_root` as a parameter to `get_project_settings` and `get_readme_content` to handle the root directory appropriately.
*   Modified `__root__` usage.
