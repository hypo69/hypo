**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Files:** The tests now use temporary dummy files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) to simulate the conditions where the files are present or absent for the `set_project_root` function.  Crucially, files are removed after the tests.

2. **`test_set_project_root_valid_input`:** Added assertions to check if the result is a `Path` object and that it's a directory.


3. **`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`:** Checks the case when no marker files are found.


4. **`test_set_project_root_marker_files_not_found`:** Tests the case when the specified marker files don't exist.

5. **`mock_settings_file` Fixture:**  A fixture to create and delete temporary `settings.json` file, greatly improving testing modularity and cleanliness.

6. **`test_settings_file_not_found`:** Crucial test added for exception handling in case the `settings.json` file is not found. This uses `monkeypatch` to mock the file system behavior.

7. **`test_set_project_root_path_in_sys_path`:** Added a test to verify the critical behaviour that the project root is added to `sys.path`.

8. **`test_settings_file_exists`:**  Simulates a case where the file exists but is empty or valid.

9. **Error Handling:** Explicitly tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the main code.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Place the test code in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution is more robust, comprehensive, and addresses the specific requirements of the prompt.  The use of temporary files in tests, and the fixture, makes the tests isolated from each other and the file system. Remember to replace `hypotez` with your actual project path if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks in the original code are insufficient for robust error handling in production. This needs careful consideration in the real application.
*   **Pathlib:** Use of `Path` objects throughout the test code, and in the `header.py` file, is crucial for platform-independent code.


Remember to adapt these tests further as you add more features to your `header.py` file.  Adding more edge cases, especially around file content and file locations, would improve the test suite further.
