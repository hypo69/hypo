**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The code now correctly imports `SpreadSheet` from the specified module.  Crucially, **replace `"data_file.csv"`, `"invalid_file.csv"`, `"empty_file.csv"`, `"output_file.csv"`** with actual file paths that exist or can be easily created for testing purposes in your environment.

2. **`TestSpreadsheet` Class:**  We use a `TestSpreadsheet` class to organize the tests.  This is good practice and makes the tests more readable and maintainable.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the type of input and expected behavior.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError`.

5. **Realistic Examples:** The test examples (`test_read_data_valid_input`, `test_read_data_invalid_file`) now use example data structures to verify that your code returns the expected result. **Critically:** Replace the placeholder data ("data_file.csv", etc) with paths to real or dummy files to make the test run.

6. **Edge Cases:**  The `test_read_data_empty_file` example demonStartes handling empty file input, which is an important edge case.  Add more as needed for your `Spreadsheet` class.

7. **Invalid Input:** `test_write_data_invalid_data` shows how to check for invalid input types (e.g., passing a string as data).  Always check for different invalid data types or unexpected situations.


**Before Running:**

- **Create dummy test files:**  Make sure `data_file.csv`, `invalid_file.csv`, and `empty_file.csv` exist or create them for the tests.
- **Install pytest:** If you haven't already, install the `pytest` library:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

- **Run the tests:** Navigate to the directory containing your test file in the terminal and run:
```bash
pytest
```


This improved solution provides a more robust and complete test suite that should now accurately assess the functionality of your `SpreadSheet` class. Remember to adapt the test cases to accurately reflect the methods and expected behaviors of your `SpreadSheet` class. Remember to adapt the assertions within the test functions (e.g., `assert data == []`, `assert isinstance(data, list)` to match the actual expected outputs of your methods.
