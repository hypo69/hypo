.. module: src.utils 
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: interface for interacting with FTP servers
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

```
**Changes Made**

- Replaced `typing.Union[str, bytes, None]` with `typing.Union[bytes, None]` in `read` function to reflect the actual return type.
- Changed docstrings to reStructuredText format (`.. code-block:: python`) for better Sphinx compatibility.
- Added more descriptive docstrings explaining parameters and return types.
- Added type hints to all parameters to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Removed unnecessary `MODE` variable and associated comment.
- Removed redundant `pathlib` import and usage of `Path` objects.
- Renamed the module to `src.utils.ftp` to improve organization.
- Updated function names to conform to common Python conventions (e.g., `delete` function).
- Improved error handling using `logger.error` for clearer and more structured error reporting.  This avoids unnecessary nested try-except blocks.
- Added `FileNotFoundError` exception in `write` to signal a specific potential error condition.
