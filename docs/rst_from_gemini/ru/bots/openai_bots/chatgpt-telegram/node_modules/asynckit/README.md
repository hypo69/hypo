# asynckit

A minimal async jobs utility library, with streams support.  It provides tools for running tasks in parallel or series, handling potential errors, and managing order.

**Features:**

* Parallel and serial iteration over arrays and objects.
* Support for aborting tasks in case of error.
* Built-in orderings (ascending, descending) and custom sorting.
* Protects against `Maximum call stack size exceeded` errors by ensuring asynchronous operations.


**Installation:**

```bash
npm install asynckit
```

**Usage Examples:**

### Parallel Execution

Runs multiple tasks concurrently, returning results in the same order as inputs.  Handles errors gracefully.

```javascript
const parallel = require('asynckit').parallel;
const assert = require('assert');

const source = [1, 1, 4, 16, 64, 32, 8, 2];
const expectedResult = [2, 2, 8, 32, 128, 64, 16, 4];
const target = [];

parallel(source, asyncJob, (err, result) => {
  assert.deepEqual(result, expectedResult);
  // Verify that the target array is filled with the input in a potentially out of order manner
  console.log(target); // output will vary since operations are run concurrently
});

function asyncJob(item, cb) {
  const delay = item * 25;
  setTimeout(() => {
    target.push(item); // Demonstrating potential order variation
    cb(null, item * 2);
  }, delay);
  // Optionally return a function to abort if needed
  return null; // No need to abort here
}
```

This example demonstrates parallel execution with potentially asynchronous tasks. The `target` array shows how the input values are processed (potentially out-of-order) by the concurrent tasks.


### Serial Execution

Executes tasks sequentially, one after the other.  Stops immediately if an error occurs in any task.

```javascript
const serial = require('asynckit').serial;
const assert = require('assert');

const source = [1, 1, 4, 16, 64, 32, 8, 2];
const expectedResult = [2, 2, 8, 32, 128, 64, 16, 4];
const target = [];

serial(source, asyncJob, (err, result) => {
  assert.deepEqual(result, expectedResult);
  console.log(target); // output will reflect the input order.
});

function asyncJob(item, cb) {
  target.push(item);
  cb(null, item * 2);
}
```

This example shows sequential execution. The `target` array will reflect the input order.


### Object Input

`asynckit` supports object input, treating keys as identifiers.

```javascript
const parallel = require('asynckit').parallel;
const source = {
  first: 1,
  one: 1,
  four: 4,
  sixteen: 16,
};

parallel(source, asyncJob, (err, result) => {
  // ...
});

function asyncJob(item, key, cb) {
  // ...
}
```


**Additional Notes:**

* Error Handling: The callback functions passed to `parallel` and `serial` should handle errors.  `asynckit` will propagate any errors encountered during execution.
* Abort Mechanisms: You can potentially return an abort function from `asyncJob` to cancel individual tasks if there's an error or other condition requiring cancellation.
* Detailed Examples: The provided examples are highly simplified.  Refer to the original documentation for comprehensive usage patterns, including error handling and aborting tasks.
