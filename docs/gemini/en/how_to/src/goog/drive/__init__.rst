How to use the `hypotez/src/goog/drive/__init__.py` module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python module (`hypotez/src/goog/drive/__init__.py`) initializes the Google Drive API interaction. It primarily sets a `MODE` variable (likely for development or production environments) and imports the `GoogleDrive` class from a submodule (`drive`).  The module's purpose is to establish a starting point for further calls to the Google Drive API.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The module initializes a variable `MODE` with the string value 'dev'. This likely represents the current environment (development).  The comments suggest this setting might influence subsequent parts of the project.
2. The module imports the `GoogleDrive` class from a submodule named `drive`. This implies a more comprehensive Google Drive API handling exists within the `drive` submodule.  Further code within that module will be responsible for actual interaction with the Google Drive service.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming the necessary imports and setup for authentication are performed elsewhere
    from hypotez.src.goog.drive import GoogleDrive

    # Create a GoogleDrive object. (Details for authentication are not included in this module)
    drive_service = GoogleDrive()

    # Call methods of the GoogleDrive object to interact with Google Drive.
    # Example (Illustrative, needs actual implementation from the 'drive' module):
    # files_list = drive_service.list_files()
    # print(files_list)
