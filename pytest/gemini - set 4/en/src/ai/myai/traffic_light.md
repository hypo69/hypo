**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

The provided code snippet `traffic_light.py` is almost entirely empty and contains no functions or classes for which to write tests.  There are no inputs to process, no logic to verify, and thus no meaningful test cases can be generated.

The placeholder tests above demonstrate how to structure tests using `pytest` when the function or class exists in the code.  Crucially, you **must** modify and tailor these placeholder examples to accurately match the actual functions, methods, or classes of your `traffic_light.py` file.

**How to proceed if you have a functioning `traffic_light.py` file:**

1. **Analyze the code:** Carefully review the Python file (`traffic_light.py`) for the functions, methods, and classes it defines. What operations do these units perform?  What inputs do they accept?  What outputs do they produce?

2. **Identify test cases:**  Based on your analysis, formulate test cases that cover:
   - **Valid inputs:**  Provide various sets of appropriate inputs to ensure the functions operate correctly.
   - **Invalid/Unexpected inputs:** If the functions handle invalid or unexpected inputs (e.g., a non-numeric value as input), test those conditions using `pytest.raises`.
   - **Edge cases/Boundary conditions:** Test values at the limits of what the functions are designed to handle (e.g., maximum or minimum values).

3. **Structure your tests:** Use descriptive function names, making the purpose of each test clear.  Use `@pytest.fixture` to define data preparation or helper functions if needed.

4. **Example for a hypothetical function:**

   ```python
   import pytest
   from hypotez.src.ai.myai.traffic_light import my_function  # Replace with your function's name

   def test_my_function_valid_input():
       result = my_function(5, 10)
       assert result == 15

   def test_my_function_invalid_input():
       with pytest.raises(TypeError):
           my_function("a", 10)  # Example of incorrect input type
   ```

By following these steps, you can write appropriate and effective `pytest` tests for your traffic light code. Remember that the tests must mirror the logic and intended behavior of the functions in `traffic_light.py`.  The empty input given was insufficient to provide a meaningful test suite.
