**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Asynchronous Tests:** The code now correctly uses `pytest.mark.asyncio` and `asyncio.run` to run asynchronous functions within `pytest`.


2. **Error Handling:** The tests now cover cases where the file doesn't exist, is locked, or a generic exception occurs during removal.  Crucially, we use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `OSError`) as appropriate.  Error messages are now checked.


3. **Mocking:**  We use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `unlink` function, simulating different scenarios, particularly important for the error cases.


4. **Cleanup:**  The tests now clean up the temporary test files (`test_file.txt`, etc.) to prevent accumulating files and potential conflicts.


5. **Clearer Assertions:** The assertions are made more specific and descriptive to validate the expected outcomes.


6. **Robust Error Simulation:** The `side_effect` parameter of `patch` is used to simulate different error conditions. The  use of `side_effect` for  simulating exceptions is the most reliable approach.


7. **Output Capture:**  The `capture_output` function now correctly captures and returns the output from `removeFile`, enabling us to verify the logged error messages.


8. **Import:**  The `import` statement for `removeFile` is updated to correctly reflect the assumed location of the file.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_utils.py`) in the same directory as your `utils.js` file or adjust the import path as necessary.
3.  Run `pytest test_utils.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides much more comprehensive and robust testing for your `removeFile` function. Remember to adapt the paths and file names to your specific test environment if needed.  Critically, the tests for error conditions (file not found, file locked, and generic exception) are now thoroughly covered. Also, the expected error messages are captured and used for testing.
