How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet defines a few variables, sets up paths, and imports various modules from a project structure. It appears to be initializing environment variables and necessary modules for data processing, likely related to e-commerce data (PrestaShop) based on the file path and module names.  Crucially, it modifies the Python path to include the project's root directory.  This is a common practice for Python projects that have their modules organized in a structured directory hierarchy.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Sets the `MODE` variable:** Initializes a variable named `MODE` to the string value 'dev'. This likely controls the environment for the application.


2. **Defines the root directory:** Creates a `Path` object (`dir_root`) that points to the root directory of the project. It constructs this path based on the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`). This step is critical for managing the project's files and modules.


3. **Appends the root directory to sys.path:**  Adds the path of the project's root directory to the Python module search path (`sys.path`).  This allows Python to find modules located within the project's directory structure.


4. **Defines src directory:** Creates a `Path` object (`dir_src`) for the 'src' directory within the project root, likely containing source code.


5. **Import Statements:** Imports numerous modules from within the project's `src` folder.  These modules likely deal with different aspects of processing data, such as handling Google Sheets, suppliers, products, categories, utilities for string manipulation, and logging.


6. **Prints the root directory:** Prints the computed `dir_root` path to the console.  This confirms the correct directory structure is recognized.


7. **Further imports:**  Additional imports are made to use specific functions, classes and functionality from the imported modules. These imports are used for different parts of the code, from manipulating strings to working with JSON data (j_dumps, j_loads, etc).

8. **Placeholder Comments:** The code contains numerous multiline strings (docstrings). These docstrings are used for documentation and are crucial for developers understanding the functionality of the modules.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a minimal example demonstrating how the module might be used.
    # Replace with specific calls to functions from the imported modules.

    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    # ... (imports from the original code)

    # Set the current working directory (important for correct path determination)
    os.chdir("/path/to/your/project/root")
    # ... (initialize other variables, such as MODE as needed)


    dir_root = Path (os.getcwd()[:os.getcwd().rfind(\'hypotez\')+11])

    print(dir_root)

    # Example usage (Replace with actual calls):
    # from src.product import Product  # Assuming Product exists
    # product = Product("product_id")  # Replace with the actual data
    # ... (Further operations with the data)
