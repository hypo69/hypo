**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:**  The `focus_group_world` fixture is crucial.  It sets up a `TinyWorld` instance with sample data (people).  The provided `setup` fixture is also included, although its use is minimal at present, you might need it to add more complex setup actions.

* **Assertions:** Tests now include `isinstance()` checks to verify the return type of `start_story` and `continue_story` to ensure they return strings as expected.

* **Edge Case (Empty World):** Added `test_story_start_empty_world` to check for an empty world. It uses `pytest.raises` to verify that a `Exception` is raised with the correct message.


* **Invalid Input (Example):** Added `test_story_start_invalid_requirements` to check for a non-string input to the `requirements` argument.


* **Clearer Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each test and the scenarios covered.

* **Robustness:** The tests now include assertions to validate that the output is indeed a string.

* **Placeholder:** The `focus_group_world` fixture is a placeholder. Replace the placeholder code with the actual implementation to load your sample world data.  


**How to Use:**

1.  Replace the placeholder implementation of the `focus_group_world` fixture with your actual world setup.
2.  Ensure that `testing_utils` is correctly imported in your tests and that the `proposition_holds` function is implemented or replaced correctly.  
3.  Run the tests with `pytest`.


This revised solution addresses the missing fixture, edge cases, and provides more robust and comprehensive test cases. Remember to adapt the fixture and world data to match your actual code structure. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.
