# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/bots/discord/header.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/bots/discord/header.py`, is a crucial initial module for your Discord bot project. It handles important tasks like finding the project root directory, loading settings, and defining project metadata.

## Key Functions and Variables

* **`set_project_root(marker_files=...) -> Path`:**
    * **Purpose:** Locates the project root directory.  This is critical for properly importing modules from various subdirectories.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `marker_files`: A tuple of filenames or directory names to search for.  The function searches upwards from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing one of these markers. Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.  This is best practice.
    * **Return Value:** A `Path` object representing the project root directory.  If no root directory is found, returns the directory containing the `header.py` file itself.
    * **Usage Example:**
      ```python
      root_path = set_project_root()
      print(root_path)
      ```
    * **Why This Is Important:**  This function ensures that Python can import modules from the correct location, even if the project is structured in a non-standard way or if the current working directory changes.

* **`__root__` (Path):**
    * **Purpose:** Holds the result of calling `set_project_root()`.  A reference to the root directory.
    * **Usage:** Used throughout the script to locate other project files, such as `settings.json` and `README.MD`.


* **`settings` (dict):**
    * **Purpose:** Holds the project settings loaded from `src/settings.json`.
    * **Usage:** Accesses configuration values such as project name, version, author, etc. via `settings['key']`.
* **`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__coffee__` (strings):**
    * **Purpose:**  These variables hold information about the project (project name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a coffee link).
    * **Usage:**  Used for displaying project information or generating documentation.  They are populated from the settings loaded earlier.


## Error Handling

The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during file reading.  This is good practice to prevent the script from crashing if the expected files aren't found or if the `settings.json` file has an invalid format.


## File Structure Assumptions

This code expects a directory structure similar to this:

```
project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── bots/
│   │   └── discord/
│   │       └── header.py
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── README.MD
└── ...other files/directories...
```

## How to Use

1.  **Place `header.py`** in the `src/bots/discord/` directory within your project structure.
2.  **Create `settings.json`** in the `src/` directory. This file should contain your project settings in JSON format. An example is:
```json
{
  "project_name": "My Discord Bot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/cofee"
}
```
3.  **Ensure `README.MD`** (or any other `marker_files`) is in the correct directory (i.e., `src`).
4.  **Import `header.py`** into other files where you need access to the project settings or root directory. The functions and variables defined in `header.py` can be accessed from any file in the project once imported.


This comprehensive usage guide provides a detailed understanding of the `header.py` file's purpose, functions, error handling, and the necessary project structure for its proper operation. Remember to adapt the example `settings.json` to your specific project needs.
