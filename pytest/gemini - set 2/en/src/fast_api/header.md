**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now precisely describe the scenario being tested.
* **Temporary Directories:** The code now creates and deletes temporary directories for testing to avoid conflicts and ensure tests run in isolation. Crucial for avoiding issues with files left behind from previous test runs.
* **Exception Handling:**  A `FileNotFoundError` is correctly handled in case the target file doesn't exist.
* **Edge Cases:** Added a test `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` which checks for the case where no marker files are found. This is a vital edge case.
* **Invalid Input Handling:** Added `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file` to verify behavior when an invalid file is specified as a marker.
* **Fixture for Cleanup:** A `@pytest.fixture` is used for cleaning up temporary directories. This ensures the test environment is reset after each test module run, preventing conflicts.
* **Robustness:** The tests now account for more diverse situations and are more likely to catch subtle errors.
* **`__file__` Simulation:** The code now constructs a dummy `__file__` path to run the tests correctly. This was missing in the previous example.
* **Import `shutil`:**  Import `shutil` for robust directory removal.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from the command line:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```


This improved solution addresses the previous shortcomings and provides a more complete and robust set of tests. Remember to replace placeholders like `test_dir` with your actual file paths during testing, if appropriate. Remember to include the `hypotez/src/fast_api/header.py` file in your test directory as well.
