**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `unittest.mock`:** Added for mocking `os.getcwd` and `Path` object in the tests.  Crucial for testing code that depends on external factors like the current working directory.


2. **Mocking `os.getcwd`:** The `test_dir_root_calculation` and  `test_sys_path_appending` now correctly mock `os.getcwd` to control the input path. This avoids errors due to the current working directory changing or unexpected inputs.


3. **Mocking `Path`:** The most important change!  The `Path` object creation is now mocked in  `test_sys_path_appending` . This prevents the tests from creating actual `Path` objects and interacting with the filesystem. This is absolutely necessary because we're testing internal logic, not external file system operations.

4. **Mocking `sys.path`:**  Added a mock for `sys.path` to prevent the tests from modifying the real Python path. This ensures isolation.

5. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test cases are more focused on verifying specific aspects of the code.  For instance `test_dir_root_calculation` now handles edge cases in calculating the path.

6. **Edge Case Handling:** Added a test for an edge case where the `hypotez` directory is not present in the path to demonStarte how to handle this.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** The original code didn't include error handling.  Adding tests for potential `FileNotFoundError` or other exceptions that might arise during file operations would be crucial.  The existing test doesn't cover these because it doesn't invoke the functionality that might cause errors.

- **Realistic Data:** Replace the mock data with actual or realistic inputs in your test data for better test coverage.  Use specific examples from the file system if available to test scenarios that could fail.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests need to cover various scenarios related to file paths and exceptions. The example given doesn't have significant logic, so the tests provided are rudimentary examples of how to use mocking and avoid side effects from external dependencies.
