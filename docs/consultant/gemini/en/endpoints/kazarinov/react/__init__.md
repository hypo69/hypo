**Changes Made**

*   Added a `main` function with error handling.  This is a good practice to prevent errors from crashing the whole program.
*   Imported `logger` from `src.logger` to handle errors properly, using logging to replace bare `try-except`.
*   Added docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format to the module and the `main` function to better explain what this code does. Added missing imports.  It is better to import all the modules at the top for better code organization.
*   Added a placeholder for initialization code with `...`.
*   Improved logging messages.  Instead of just stating an error, include the error message in the log to help in debugging.
