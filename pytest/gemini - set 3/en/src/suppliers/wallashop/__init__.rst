**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The provided code only defined `MODE` which is a constant. To test the `Graber` class, I've created a `MockGraber` class that mimics its behavior.  Crucially, this allows you to control the output of `fetch`, crucial for unit testing.

2. **Comprehensive `Graber` Tests:**
   - `test_graber_valid_response`: Checks that `fetch` returns the expected data when a response is provided.
   - `test_graber_empty_response`: Tests the case where the response is empty, demonStarting that `None` is returned.
   - `test_graber_no_response_data`: Covers the case where no data is prepared for the response.
   - `test_graber_fetch_raises_exception`:  This is *extremely* important!  It tests for exceptions during the `fetch` process.  This is how you demonStarte that your code correctly handles potential errors, rather than ignoring them.  Importantly, we use `pytest.raises` to assert that the specific exception type is raised.

3. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.

4. **Isolation:** Each test function operates independently, ensuring that one test doesn't affect the results of others.

5. **Edge Cases:** The tests now cover scenarios where the response might be empty or not provided.

6. **Exception Handling:** The example demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to verify that the code handles exceptions gracefully.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_wallashop.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_wallashop.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Tests:**

*   **Replace `MockGraber`:**  In a real test, you'll replace `MockGraber` with a test harness (likely using `unittest.mock` or a similar library) that can interact with any external services your `Graber` class might use (such as an HTTP client) while preventing unintended side effects.

*   **Realistic Data:**  The sample data (e.g., `mock_data`) should reflect the real data structure your function expects, including potential errors or edge cases.

*   **More `Graber` Tests:**   The current tests are quite limited. Consider tests for various URL types, error codes, and potential connection problems.

* **Replace `MockException` with the actual exception:**  In your actual `Graber` class, determine the specific exception you're anticipating and use that instead of `MockException`.



By following these improvements, you create more robust and reliable tests that cover a wider range of possible scenarios, and are critical to the integrity of your codebase. Remember to adapt the tests based on the actual implementation of the `Graber` class and its dependencies.
