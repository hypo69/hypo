**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`get_project_root` Refactoring:** The duplicate `get_project_root` function is removed.  This is much cleaner. The logic is simplified and made more Pythonic.


* **Error Handling (Crucial):**  Checks if the binary directories actually exist.  If a directory doesn't exist, it won't cause an error, but the code won't be able to use the associated tools.

* **`sys.path` Enhancement:**  The `sys.path` updates are now done in a more robust way.  It checks if a path already exists in `sys.path` to avoid redundant entries.  This is much more efficient and reliable.


* **Docstring Cleanup:** Minor improvements to docstrings for readability.


* **Import Organization:** Imports are grouped logically.


* **Comments:**  Removed unnecessary comments.


* **`__root__` Handling:** The `__root__` variable is correctly initialized and used consistently throughout.


* **Import `gs` Fix:** Removed extra imports and moved `from src import gs` higher so it's available when needed.


* **Warnings:**  `warnings.filterwarnings` is applied *correctly* to the `gtk` module now, which is much more specific and avoids potentially suppressing other warnings from different modules.



This revised code is more robust, efficient, and follows best practices.  It's also easier to maintain and understand.  Always remember to thoroughly test your code after any significant changes. Remember to install the `packaging` library if it's not already installed. `pip install packaging`
