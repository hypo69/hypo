**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically, the code now mocks the `Kazarinov` class and the `webbrowser.open` function.  This isolates the FastAPI application's logic from external dependencies (like the actual Kazarinov API call or browser opening) allowing us to test specific aspects.

2. **`app_with_mock` Fixture:** Creates a test app. This makes testing the endpoint much cleaner and more manageable.

3. **`test_open_browser`:**  This test directly checks if `webbrowser.open` was called.  It's important to test this, as a failure to open the browser would be a major issue.

4. **`test_ask_question_valid`:** DemonStartes a test for a valid input.

5. **`test_ask_question_empty_question`:**  Added a test for an empty question, which is a crucial edge case.

6. **`test_ask_question_next`:** DemonStartes a test case for the "--next" input to verify that the logic of choosing a random question is working as intended. This checks that a response is returned if the user enters `--next`.

7. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more specific, e.g., checking for the presence of the mock response within the returned text.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Create a `templates` directory** and `static`  directory at the root of your test folder or adjust the path used in the fixtures accordingly.
3. Create a `chat.html` template file inside the templates directory.
4. Create a `static` directory at the root of your test folder and copy the relevant Bootstrap CSS files in.
5.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```


**Important Considerations:**

*   **`src` and `gs`:** The provided code relies on modules and paths (`gs.path`, etc.). You'll need to ensure that these are correctly configured in your testing environment.   Adjust `Path` instances in the fixtures if necessary. 
*   **`questions_list`:** The code assumes `questions_list` is populated. You'll need a way to create that list in your test cases, or mock its existence if it's not critical to your current test coverage.
*   **Error Handling:** The provided tests currently assume the Kazarinov method will return something.  It would be prudent to add error handling in the `ask_question` function (and tests) for potential Kazarinov errors.
