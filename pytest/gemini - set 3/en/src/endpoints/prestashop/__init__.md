# Import the module under test
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop import (
    PrestaShop,
    PrestaProduct,
    PrestaSupplier,

)


# No specific functions are provided for testing, only imports.
# To write meaningful tests, we need the actual implementation of the classes.
# This example demonStartes how to test with dummy implementations.

# Dummy implementations for testing purposes.
class DummyPrestaShop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mode = "dev"  # Example attribute

    # Example method
    def get_mode(self):
        return self.mode

class DummyPrestaProduct:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

class DummyPrestaCustomer:
    def __init__(self, id, email):
        self.id = id
        self.email = email



# Example Tests (using the dummy classes)

def test_prestashop_mode():
    """Tests if the PrestaShop class correctly retrieves its mode."""
    prestashop = DummyPrestaShop()
    assert prestashop.get_mode() == "dev"


def test_presta_customer_creation():
    """Tests if the PrestaCustomer class initializes with correct parameters."""
    customer = DummyPrestaCustomer(123, "test@example.com")
    assert customer.id == 123
    assert customer.email == "test@example.com"


# This is crucial. Replace the dummy classes with the actual ones from your code
# before running the tests. 
# Otherwise, these tests will fail or not run because the classes aren't defined.


#  Add more tests for PrestaProduct, PrestaSupplier, etc.
#  Focus on the methods and functionalities defined in the imported classes.
#  Example for PrestaProduct (assuming a get_product_by_id method exists):

# def test_presta_product_get_by_id_valid():
#     """Tests getting a product by ID."""
#     product_id = 123
#     product = DummyPrestaProduct(product_id) #Replace with correct object from your code
#     result = PrestaProduct.get_product_by_id(product_id)
#     assert result.id == product_id #Assert based on the actual implementation of get_product_by_id


#  Additional test cases for PriceListRequester, exception handling (using pytest.raises),
#  and boundary conditions should be added as needed based on the actual code.


# If there were methods in the imported classes, add tests for each of them:
#  e.g. test methods like get_products(), get_suppliers() etc.


```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Classes:**  The code now includes dummy classes (`DummyPrestaShop`, `DummyPrestaProduct`, `DummyPrestaCustomer`).  This is absolutely necessary for testing the *imports* themselves.  Crucially, replace these with the actual implementations of these classes from your `prestashop` module when you have them.

2. **Example Tests:**  Example tests demonStarte how to test the `PrestaShop` class and the `PrestaCustomer` class (added).

3. **Missing Code:** The crucial part is the absence of code *inside* the imported classes.   You need to provide the code from `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/__init__.py` and `*.py` files. These tests will only work when there's a class structure to test.


4. **Thorough Testing:**  Actual testing will require careful examination of the methods within each class (`PrestaProduct`, `PrestaSupplier`, etc.) and testing valid/invalid inputs, edge cases, and exceptions raised by them. The current example is a basic framework; add tests according to the actual code structure and functionality of your classes.

5. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):** Add tests using `pytest.raises` to verify that exceptions are raised when appropriate (e.g., invalid input).


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Replace the Dummy Classes:**  Copy and paste the actual class definitions from your `prestashop` module into the appropriate places in the test file (replace the dummy classes).

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


Remember to adapt the test functions based on the methods and attributes in the actual `PrestaShop` and related classes. Provide the actual code for more tailored and comprehensive test cases.
