# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.

# Example of how tests would be written if there was Python code:
# Assuming a file named 'popup.py' contained functions to be tested.

# Example 'popup.py' (replace with your actual code)
# import selenium.webdriver as webdriver
# def get_page_title(driver):
#     """Returns the title of the current page."""
#     return driver.title


# Example test file (test_popup.py)
# import pytest
# from selenium import webdriver
# from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
# from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
# import time

# @pytest.fixture
# def driver():
#     """Creates a webdriver instance."""
#     driver = webdriver.Edge()
#     yield driver
#     driver.quit()


# def test_get_page_title_valid_input(driver):
#     """Tests getting the page title with a valid page."""
#     driver.get("https://www.example.com")  # Replace with a valid URL
#     title = get_page_title(driver)
#     assert title is not None, "Title should not be None"
#     assert len(title) > 0, "Title should not be empty"

# def test_get_page_title_invalid_url(driver):
#     """Tests getting the page title with an invalid URL."""
#     with pytest.raises(Exception):
#         driver.get("invalid_url")

# def test_get_page_title_no_driver(driver):
#    """Checks getting page title with invalid driver object."""
#    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
#        get_page_title(None)

#     """Checks getting page title with empty driver."""
#     driver.get("about:blank")

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) contains no Python code.  Therefore, there's nothing to test.  The example code demonstrates how tests would be constructed if a `popup.py` file existed with functions to be tested.  Crucially, it includes:

* **Fixtures:** The `@pytest.fixture` for the `driver` is essential for setting up and tearing down the WebDriver instance. This prevents resource leaks and ensures each test runs in an isolated environment.
* **Error Handling:** The `pytest.raises` context manager is used effectively to test exceptions for invalid URLs and empty/invalid driver objects. This is critical for robustness.
* **Valid/Invalid Input:** The examples cover scenarios with valid URLs and also with cases where you might expect errors, like an invalid URL.
* **Edge Cases:** The example includes a test for a blank page (`about:blank`) which might exhibit different behavior than a fully rendered page.
* **Clear Test Names:** The test function names clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

**To Write Actual Tests:**

1.  **Add Python Code:** If you have Python code (e.g., in a file named `popup.py`) that interacts with the HTML file (e.g., using Selenium to perform actions on the page), provide that code.
2.  **Adapt the Example:** Modify the example test file to test the specific functions and classes within your Python code.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have `pytest` and the Selenium WebDriver for your browser (e.g., `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`).


```bash
pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
```


Replace the example `popup.py` with your actual code, and you'll have a complete and functional test suite. Remember to adjust the URLs and selectors in the example test functions according to your specific application. Remember to install the `selenium` library too: `pip install selenium`
