How to use the `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py` file

This file, located at `hypotez/src/templates/_examples/__init__.py`, appears to be part of a larger project's template structure. It's likely used as a starting point for creating example code.  It's not a standalone executable or importable module in the typical sense.

**Key Points and Potential Usage:**

* **Documentation Strings (`"""Docstrings"""`)**: The file is heavily commented with docstrings, which are very important for understanding its purpose.  Each block of multiline strings (triple quotes) likely describes aspects of the example.  However, the current docstrings are incomplete and unhelpful without context.  The `:platform` and `:synopsis` tags are Sphinx/ReadTheDocs directives, implying you're using documentation generation tools like Sphinx.

* **`MODE = 'dev'`**:  This variable likely defines a mode (e.g., development, production).  This mode might affect how the examples behave.

* **`from packaging.version import Version`**: This imports the `Version` class from the `packaging` library, which is used for working with Python versions. This suggests that versioning is important for the examples or the project as a whole.

* **`from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__`**: This imports version information.  This likely pulls in versioning data from a separate file, `version.py` (which is not present in the snippet).

* **Shebang Lines (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`)**: These lines specify the interpreter to use when running the script.  This suggests that the `hypotez` project uses a virtual environment, and the script might be runnable. However, the code snippet is missing the actual script body needed to execute the code.

**How to use this in context:**

1. **Understand the Project Structure:** The `_examples` folder suggests that this is a template for creating examples.  You will need the other files (and likely directories) to see the full project structure and how these examples are meant to be used.
2. **Completing the Examples:** The file is essentially a shell (it is missing its body).  You need to populate the example code blocks (the code after `...`) within this `__init__.py` file to create examples.
3. **Generate Documentation:** You should use a tool like Sphinx to generate documentation from the docstrings. This will create a usable and informative guide for how to use the examples.
4. **Run the Examples:** If the examples are executable, you'll likely need to run them from a terminal in the environment specified by the shebang lines.

**Example of how to fill in (imaginary) code:**

```python
# ... (previous content)
import os
import sys

def my_example_function(arg1, arg2):
    """This example function demonstrates..."""
    result = arg1 + arg2
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = my_example_function(5, 3)
    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

**Crucial missing information:** The provided code snippet is highly incomplete.  Context, the rest of the project files, and the intended purpose of the `_examples` directory are needed to properly use and understand the code.
