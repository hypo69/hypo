Module for file operations.
=========================================================================================

This module provides functions for saving, reading, and manipulating files.  It includes support
for reading files in a directory and handling various data types (strings, lists, dictionaries).
Error handling is implemented using the logger.  File paths are handled using the Pathlib library
for better cross-platform compatibility.

# Changes Made

*   Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Added type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   Improved error handling using `logger.error` for better logging.
*   Added more specific error messages.
*   Removed redundant `...` placeholders.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific actions (e.g., "validation" instead of "do").
*   Added comprehensive RST documentation to functions, methods, and the module itself.
*   Fixed issues with incorrect data handling in the `save_text_file` function.
*   Added checks to handle different types of input data in `save_text_file` for robustness.
*   Corrected `elif path.is_dir()` block in `read_text_file` for proper handling of directories.
*   Corrected `get_filenames` function to handle both string and list extensions.  Added checks and error handling.
*  Consistently used single quotes (`'`) for strings in Python code.
* Removed unnecessary imports.
* Removed `#!` directives as they are not needed.
