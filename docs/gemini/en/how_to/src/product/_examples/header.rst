How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code snippet defines some paths, adds directories to the Python module search path, imports various modules, and then prints the root directory.  It is part of a larger project, likely related to product management or data processing, given the imports related to products, categories, and utilities.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries**:  The code imports modules like `sys`, `os`, `pathlib`, `json`, `re`, and various modules within the project's `src` directory, including those related to product handling, category management, utility functions, and logging.

2. **Define the root directory**: It calculates the absolute path to the root directory containing the `hypotez` project using `os.getcwd()`. This is critical for handling file paths within the project.

3. **Add root directory to sys.path**: It appends the root directory's path to the `sys.path` list. This allows Python to find and import modules from the `src` directory and any subdirectories within the project.

4. **Set up additional paths**:  The code defines the path to the `src` directory relative to the root directory. This is likely for organizing imports of modules within the project.


5. **Print the root directory**: The `print(dir_root)` statement displays the calculated root directory path to the console, confirming the successful path resolution and location of the project directory.

6. **Further imports:** The code continues importing modules specific to the task at hand.

7. **Initialization and setup:** The file contains substantial imports, suggesting further initialization or setup procedures (e.g., database connection, configuration loading) that are not fully displayed in this snippet.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (Assumes you have a project structure with hypotez as the root directory)
    import os
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    # Replace with the actual path if different
    dir_root = Path(os.getcwd()[:os.getcwd().rfind('hypotez') + 7])
    sys.path.append(str(dir_root))

    # Ensure the src directory exists (and other directories if needed)
    # ...

    from hypotez.src.product._examples.header import dir_root

    print(dir_root)
