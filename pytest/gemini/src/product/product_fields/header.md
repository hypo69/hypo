**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `__file__`:** The previous solution had a significant issue with handling the `__file__` path when the marker file is in a parent directory. The test incorrectly assumed that the test setup would correctly affect the path.  Instead, a `unittest.mock` patch is used to directly set the `__file__` variable to a known path *inside* a temporary directory that allows the tests to properly handle marker files in a parent directory.  This prevents problems with the `Path` calculations and makes the tests more robust.

2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better reflect the scenario being tested.

3. **Robust Temporary Directory Handling:** The tests now create and clean up temporary directories and files, ensuring that they don't interfere with other tests or leave files behind. This is *crucial* for pytest and testing in general.

4. **Comprehensive Scenarios:** The tests now cover valid paths, cases where no marker files are found, and the critical edge case where the marker file is in a parent directory.

5. **Error Handling:** The test now uses `pytest.raises` to check if `FileNotFoundError` is raised when a marker file does not exist, as required by the prompt.

6. **Import `sys`:** The `sys` module is imported so that `sys.path` can be tested.


**To Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as `hypotez/src/product/product_fields/header.py`.
3.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved solution is more complete, addresses the critical issue with parent directories, and ensures that the tests are reliable and effective. Remember to adapt the file paths in the tests if your project structure changes.  Also, you would want to add a more comprehensive test that uses a JSON file to check loading the settings.
