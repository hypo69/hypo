How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines functions to manage a custom context menu item ('hypo AI assistant') in Windows Explorer. It allows users to add or remove this item from the context menu displayed when right-clicking on empty spaces within folders and on the desktop. The code interacts with the Windows Registry to achieve this functionality.  It uses `winreg` for registry operations, `os` for file system checks, and `tkinter` for a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to easily add or remove the context menu item.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code begins by importing modules for interacting with the Windows Registry (`winreg`), the operating system (`os`), the graphical user interface toolkit (`tkinter`), and potentially other custom modules (`header`, `gs`).

2. **Define `add_context_menu_item()`:** This function is responsible for adding the custom context menu item.
   - It constructs the registry path (`key_path`) for the context menu item in the Windows Registry.
   - It creates a new registry key at the specified path.
   - It sets the display name for the context menu item.
   - It defines the `command_key` to specify the action to perform when the context menu item is selected.
   - It constructs the path to the Python script (`command_path`) that should be executed when the context menu item is clicked.
   - It verifies the existence of the script file using `os.path.exists`. If the script is not found, it displays an error message and returns without proceeding.
   - It sets the `command` for the context menu item, including the Python interpreter path and the script file path to execute.
   - It displays a success message upon successful registry updates.
   - Includes error handling for potential exceptions during registry operations.

3. **Define `remove_context_menu_item()`:** This function handles removing the custom context menu item.
   - It constructs the registry path (`key_path`) for the context menu item to be removed.
   - It attempts to delete the specified registry key using `reg.DeleteKey`.
   - Displays success or warning messages based on whether the removal was successful or if the item was not found.
   - Includes error handling for potential exceptions during registry deletion.

4. **Define `create_gui()`:** This function creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the context menu management.
   - Initializes a `tkinter` window (`root`).
   - Creates buttons for adding, removing, and exiting the application.
   - Associates the buttons' `command` attributes with the `add_context_menu_item()`, `remove_context_menu_item()`, and `root.quit()` functions, respectively.
   - Enters the `tkinter` main loop, making the GUI interactive.

5. **Main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: Calls the `create_gui()` function to start the GUI application when the script is run directly.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming necessary imports and gs.path are defined):
    # This is not directly executable code in the example, but would be how the functions are used:

    add_context_menu_item()  # Adds the context menu item.
    remove_context_menu_item()  # Removes the context menu item.
