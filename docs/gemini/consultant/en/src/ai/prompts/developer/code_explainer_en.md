#Example Request:  
#
#```python
#from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum
#
#def add_numbers(a, b):
#    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
#    return result
#```
#
#Expected Response:  
#
#```
#<input code>
#from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum
#
#def add_numbers(a, b):
#    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
#    return result
#
#<algorithm>
#1. The function `calculate_sum` is imported from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
#2. A function `add_numbers` is defined, taking two arguments, `a` and `b`.
#3. The `calculate_sum(a, b)` function is called to compute the sum of `a` and `b`.
#4. The result of the function is returned to the caller.
#
#Example:  
#- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 5`.  
#- Algorithm: `calculate_sum(3, 5)`.  
#- Result: `8`.  
#
#<explanation>
#**Imports**:  
#- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: Imports the `calculate_sum` function, which is used to perform the addition. This module is located in the `src.utils` package.
#
#**Function `add_numbers`**:  
#- Purpose: Simplifies the addition of two numbers by utilizing the `calculate_sum` function.  
#- Arguments:  
#  - `a` (number): The first operand.  
#  - `b` (number): The second operand.  
#- Return Value: The result of adding `a` and `b`.  
#
#**Relationship with Other Packages**:  
#- The `src.utils.calculator` module is likely part of a library for mathematical operations.  
#- If `calculate_sum` relies on additional modules, this can be clarified in its documentation.
#
#**Possible Improvements**:  
#- Add type checks for the `a` and `b` arguments to prevent errors.  
#- Localize the `calculate_sum` call within the module if it is not reused elsewhere.
#
#This instruction is designed to ensure the model analyzes the code in detail and provides a comprehensive description of each element's functionality.

Module for analyzing and explaining code functionality.
========================================================================================

This module defines functions for analyzing provided code and generating explanations.

Usage Example
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    code_analysis_result = analyze_code(code_to_analyze)
    print(code_analysis_result)
"""
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads
from src.logger import logger


def analyze_code(input_code):
    """
    Analyzes the provided code and explains its functionality.

    :param input_code: The code to analyze.
    :type input_code: str
    :return: A dictionary containing the analysis results.
    :rtype: dict
    """
    try:

        # ... (stopping point if parsing yields data structure)
        algorithm = ""  # Initialize algorithm description.
        explanation = ""  # Initialize explanation.

        return analysis_results
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error analyzing code: {e}")
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

Changes Made
- Added a docstring to the `analyze_code` function, following RST style.
- Added a module docstring to the module, following RST style.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added error handling using `logger.error` for potential exceptions.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
- Included placeholder comments (`# ...`) for potential stopping points and further development.
- Reformatted comments for better readability and RST compliance.
