How to use the AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest class
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest` that inherits from the `RestApi` class. This class is likely part of a larger system for interacting with the AliExpress Affiliate API. It prepares the necessary parameters to retrieve affiliate order information.  The class initializes parameters such as the API domain, port, application signature, specific fields to retrieve, and order IDs.  The crucial function `getapiname` returns the specific API endpoint name for order retrieval.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The class constructor (`__init__`) sets up the connection details (domain, port) inherited from the `RestApi` class, and initializes empty variables for the application signature, desired fields, and a list of order IDs.

2. **API Endpoint Definition:** The `getapiname` method returns the string 'aliexpress.affiliate.order.get'.  This string is the specific API endpoint used for order retrieval.

3. **Data Preparation (Not Shown):**  Crucially, the `__init__` method *initializes* parameters, but the code *doesn't* contain logic to actually *fetch* data from the API. The code is incomplete without additional methods to call the API endpoint and handle the response.  Likely, you would populate the `self.order_ids` and `self.fields` properties with specific values for the desired order data.

4. **API Call (Outside this class):** To make the actual API call, you would need to call a method of the `RestApi` class, inherited by this class, to send the request.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest.AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest import AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest
    
    # Initialize the request object. Replace with your actual values.
    request = AliexpressAffiliateOrderGetRequest()
    request.order_ids = ['12345', '67890']
    request.fields = ['order_id', 'product_name']  # Specify fields to retrieve

    # This is a placeholder for how you would interact with the actual REST API.  
    # The actual call to the API would happen using code inherited from RestApi.
    # For example:
    # try:
    #     response = request.execute() # Assuming execute() exists from RestApi class.
    #     # Process the response
    #     print(response)
    # except Exception as e:
    #    print(f"Error: {e}")
