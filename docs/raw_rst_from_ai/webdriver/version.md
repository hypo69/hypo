**Explanation of Changes and Best Practices:**

* **Removed unnecessary multi-line strings:**  The `""" """` blocks around the docstrings and copyright were unnecessary and made the code harder to read.  The `=` sign followed by a single quote string is the correct way to assign variables like `__version__`.


**How to use this file (example):**

```python
import hypotez.src.webdriver.version as version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__author__)
print(version.__copyright__)
```

This will output the version, author, and copyright information stored in the `version.py` file.  This is a common way to access versioning information in a Python project.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`venv` Path:** The `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` shebang is a *potential* problem. If this is a *module* file, the shebang should *not* be included in the file. The shebang is used in scripts to specify the Python interpreter used to execute that script. It does **not** affect how the Python modules are imported or used in another Python file (which is what `version.py` is doing).  If this were a script, it would indicate which Python interpreter to use to run it.
* **Documentation:** The `__doc__` and `__details__` variables are currently empty strings.  You should populate these with more informative documentation about the `webdriver` module or component.  This helps other developers understand the purpose and functionality of the module.
* **`__version__` format:** While `'v1.1'` is understandable, consider using a more standardized versioning scheme (e.g., `'1.1.0'`).  This will be helpful when you start using version control systems like Git.

By following these best practices, your `version.py` file will be more usable, readable, and maintainable within a larger Python project. Remember to adjust the shebang if you are using a different virtual environment.
