```
Changes Made
```
- Added missing `import` statement for `jjson` from `src.utils`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `jjson.j_loads` for consistent data loading.
- Added `logger.error` for handling potential errors during file loading, preventing crashes.
- Improved variable names to be more descriptive (e.g., `project_root`).
- Added detailed docstrings (reStructuredText) for `get_project_root` function and other functions/variables.
- Removed redundant `__root__` variable.
- Modified variable assignments to use proper Pythonic style (e.g., `__version__` instead of `__version__: str`).
- Included error handling and logging for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD` files using `try-except` blocks and `logger.error` for more informative errors.
- Added more detailed documentation and explanations in the RST format.
