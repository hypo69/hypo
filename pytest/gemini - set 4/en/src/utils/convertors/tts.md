**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `requests`:** The crucial improvement is using the `responses` library to mock the `requests` library. This allows us to test `speech_recognizer` without needing an actual network connection or an external audio file.  This makes the tests much more reliable.  The `@responses.activate` decorator is essential.

2. **Mocking File Operations:**   The `mock_audio_file` fixture now creates a temporary file containing sample data, which is crucial for testing `speech_recognizer`'s file handling.

3. **Error Handling Tests:** Added tests to check for `requests.exceptions.RequestException` (for invalid URLs) and `FileNotFoundError` (when the audio file doesn't exist).

4. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` for the exception handling tests, following the prompt's instructions.

5. **Clearer Assertions:** Instead of just checking for output, I've added more specific assertions (e.g., checking for the existence of the downloaded file).  The example uses a placeholder `some_text_recognized`, because the original code doesn't define what it *should* return.

6. **Correct Error Output Handling:** The test now checks if the expected error message is returned when Google Speech Recognition or other parts of the code fail.

7. **Asyncio Test:** `test_text2speech_valid_input` now correctly uses `asyncio.run` to run the asynchronous function, allowing proper testing.
8. **Invalid Language:** Added `test_text2speech_invalid_input` to check the expected exception when an invalid language code is provided.


**How to run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_tts.py`) in the same directory as your `tts.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_tts.py`.


Remember to replace `"some_text_recognized"` with the actual expected output based on your `speech_recognizer` function's implementation for valid inputs.  This will produce better, more informative test output.  Also add more specific cases based on the function's requirements.  For example, test with various language codes and different audio file types. Remember to add appropriate error handling in your tests.
