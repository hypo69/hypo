**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Dummy Logger:** A `DummyLogger` class is created to replace the actual logger. This is crucial for testing, as it prevents the tests from interacting with a real logging system.
* **Error Handling:** Tests are added to check for `RequestException`, `UnknownValueError`, and general exceptions during speech recognition, improving robustness.
* **Mocking:** The `mocker` is used to simulate exceptions from the `requests` and `speech_recognition` libraries, which is essential for isolating the test and verifying that exception handling in the code is working as expected.
* **Valid URL:** Use `pytest.fixture` for the `audio_file_path` to properly generate a valid temporary file and avoid failing tests due to missing data.
* **Error Checking:** Assertions are added to verify that the functions return expected error messages in cases of invalid input or exceptions.
* **File Existence Check:**  Checks if the generated audio file actually exists after the `text2speech` function completes. This verifies that the conversion process is successful.
* **Import Fix:** Changed `from src.utils.convertors import tts` to make sure you're actually importing the `tts` module.
* **asyncio Usage:**  Correctly uses `asyncio.run` to execute the `text2speech` function, which is an async function.


**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_tts.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_tts.py`


Remember to replace `"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Example.ogg"` with a valid audio URL for testing purposes. This improved solution provides much more comprehensive and robust test coverage. Also, consider adding more tests for different languages, file formats, and edge cases specific to your use case.
