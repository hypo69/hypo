# This is an important part!  Without specific method implementations,
#  you'll get errors regarding missing attributes. These examples are placeholders.
# Ensure that the `PrestaCustomer` class includes the methods you intend to test 
# before running these tests.  They may need their own fixtures if they
#  have complex inputs or interactions.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better describe the scenario being tested.
* **ValueError Handling:** Added tests specifically for cases where `api_domain` or `api_key` are missing, ensuring the correct `ValueError` is raised.
* **Fixture for Credentials:** A `credentials` fixture is introduced to make tests using credentials more organized and reusable.
* **Example Tests (Placeholder):** Added placeholder examples for testing the `add_customer_PrestaShop` method and exception handling.  Crucially, these are *placeholders* – you must replace the `# ...` with actual calls to the methods and assertions on the return values or exceptions raised.
* **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to the test functions explaining their purpose.  This improves readability and maintainability.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover different scenarios, including valid and invalid input conditions.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Implement PrestaCustomer Methods:**  The placeholder `test_add_customer_valid` and similar tests are useless without actual implementations of the methods (`add_customer_PrestaShop`, etc.) within the `PrestaCustomer` class.  Replace the placeholders with the appropriate testing code and assertions.

2. **Actual Test Cases:** Based on the functionality of your methods, devise more specific test cases, particularly for error handling, edge cases (e.g., invalid data formats), and boundary conditions.

3. **Use Mocks (If Necessary):** If the `PrestaCustomer` class interacts with external services (e.g., an API), consider using `pytest.mock` to simulate external calls and isolate your tests.

4. **Realistic Data:**  Use meaningful data (not just placeholders) when testing your methods.


By following these steps, you'll create a much more effective and comprehensive test suite for your `PrestaCustomer` class. Remember to thoroughly test the methods in various ways.
