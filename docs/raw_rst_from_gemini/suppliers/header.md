**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block to handle the case where the project root is not found.  This prevents the script from crashing unexpectedly.  A `FileNotFoundError` is now raised and caught if no marker file is found, and the script exits with an error code (1).  This is *critical* for robust code.
* **Clearer Docstring:** Improved the docstring to be more informative, including the *expected* return type (`Path`).  Added `Raises` section to the docstring to detail the possible exception that can be raised. The `marker_files` parameter is also better explained (it now searches for the existence of one *file* or *directory*).
* **`__root__` initialization:** Moved the initialization of `__root__` *inside* the `try...except` block.  This ensures that `__root__` is only defined if the root directory is successfully found. This prevents accidental use of an uninitialized variable.
* **Example Usage (commented out):** Included a commented-out example demonstrating how to import modules from within the project. This is crucial for showing how the `__root__` variable is used in practice.
* **Import fix:** The `import some_module` example in the file has been commented out. It was unnecessary and didn't make sense in the context of a header file.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:** Error handling is essential for preventing crashes.
* **Clarity:** A well-written docstring makes the code more understandable and reusable.
* **Correctness:** The addition of `return project_root` directly after the `if` statement ensures the correct path is returned when a marker file is found, directly addressing the original issue.
* **Practicality:** The example usage demonstrates how to utilize the `__root__` variable for actual imports.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and ready for use in a real-world project.  Remember to replace the placeholder example import statements with your actual imports. Remember to install the `packaging` library:
```bash
pip install packaging
```
