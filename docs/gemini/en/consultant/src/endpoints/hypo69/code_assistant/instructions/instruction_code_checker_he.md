# Changes Made

*   Imported `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` and `logger` from `src.logger`.
*   Added docstrings (reStructuredText) to the function `process_data` following RST format.
*   Added `try-except` blocks for robust error handling and proper exception propagation using `logger.error` instead of standard `try-except`.
*   Improved error messages for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
*   Added validation to ensure the loaded data is a dictionary.
*   Documented `process_data` with type hints.
*   Commented out parts of the original code needing substantial refactoring with explanations using the `#` symbol.
*   Consistently use single quotes in the code.
