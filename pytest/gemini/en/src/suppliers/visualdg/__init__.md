**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Added a `mock_graber_data` fixture to provide data for the `Graber` tests.  Crucially, **replace this placeholder with an actual fixture** if the `Graber` constructor needs real data (e.g., from a file or a database). This will allow your test to utilize a predictable, controlled dataset.

2. **Error Handling:** Included a `test_graber_invalid_input` to demonstrate how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`. This is crucial for robust testing, showing how your code handles invalid inputs.  The example uses `KeyError`, but you should replace this with the exception raised by the actual code.

3. **No Input Test:** Added a `test_graber_no_input` to check that the code handles the case of no input gracefully (e.g., an empty dictionary passed to the constructor).  This type of test is particularly important for production code.

4. **MODE test:** Added a test to verify the MODE constant.

5. **Example for Other Functionality:** Added a comment and example structure for testing other functions or methods of the `Graber` class (e.g., `process_data`) if they exist.  **You must add actual tests for these methods.**

6. **Clear Assertions:** The example now includes placeholder assertions. **Replace these placeholders** with assertions that validate the *actual* behavior of `Graber` with the test data.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Actual Graber Functionality:**  The tests are very basic now; they need to be expanded significantly to cover the actual functionality of the `Graber` class. Add assertions to validate the object's state, return values from its methods (if any), and handling of invalid input (e.g., incorrect data types, missing values).  
* **Realistic Data:** Replace the mock data with meaningful test data, simulating real-world scenarios.
* **Test Coverage:**  Write tests that cover all possible paths through the code.  Branch coverage is particularly important.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_visualdg.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_visualdg.py`.


This revised answer provides a much more comprehensive and practical starting point for testing your `Graber` class. Remember to tailor the tests to reflect the actual structure and behavior of your code.
