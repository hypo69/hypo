"""
This module provides an interface for interacting with FTP servers. It includes functions to send, receive, and delete files from an FTP server.

** Purpose **:
Allows for sending media files (images, videos), spreadsheets, and other files to and from an FTP server. 

** Modules **:
- helpers (local): Local helper utilities for FTP operations.
- typing: Type hints for function parameters and return values.
- ftplib: Provides FTP protocol client capabilities.
- pathlib: For handling file system paths.

Functions:
    - `write`: Sends a file to an FTP server.
    - `read`: Retrieves a file from an FTP server.
    - `delete`: Deletes a file from an FTP server.

```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Uses `ftplib.all_errors` to catch a wider range of FTP-related errors (connection, transfer, etc.).  Crucially, this replaces the generic `Exception` catch, preventing accidental swallowing of crucial FTP errors.
* **`FileNotFoundError` Catch:** Added a `try...except FileNotFoundError` block in the `write` function to handle the case where the source file doesn't exist. This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly.
* **Clearer Error Logging:** More descriptive error messages are logged, making debugging significantly easier.
* **Robust `finally` block:**  The `finally` block ensures the FTP session is closed even if errors occur during file operations.  This is critical for resource management.
* **Return Values:** All functions now return `False` if any error occurs *during* the FTP operation.  This allows calling functions to properly handle failure cases.
* **`finally` block improvements:**  The `finally` block now returns `False` in case there's a problem during session closing, further enhancing error handling and preventing potential crashes.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Input Validation:**  Consider adding input validation (e.g., checking if file paths are valid, if directory names are acceptable on FTP).
* **Connection Pooling (Advanced):** For high-throughput applications, consider using a connection pool to manage FTP connections efficiently.
* **Timeout Handling:** Add timeouts to the connection attempts to prevent indefinite blocking if the FTP server is unavailable.


This revised code is significantly more robust and reliable due to the improved error handling and resource management.  Remember to install the `ftplib` library if you haven't already: `pip install ftplib`.  Also, ensure `src.logger` is properly defined and working.
