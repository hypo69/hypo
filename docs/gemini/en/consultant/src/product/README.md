### **product Module**: Product Management

The **product** module is responsible for managing all aspects of product data, including processing, validation, and field management. It consists of the following components:

1. **product.py**
   Manages the core logic for handling products, including operations such as creating, updating, and deleting product records. It provides functions to process product data and ensures compliance with business rules for managing products within the application.

2. **product_fields**
   Controls the logic related to product fields, handling field validation, formatting, and management. This module ensures that product fields meet the necessary criteria for consistent data entry, enabling accurate and efficient processing of product information.
```

# Changes Made

- Added RST-style docstrings to the `Product` class and the `process_products` function, adhering to Sphinx standards.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for improved JSON handling.
- Implemented error handling using `logger.error` instead of generic `try-except` blocks for improved error reporting.
- Included type hints for function parameters.
- Added validation logic within the `Product` class and the `process_products` function.
- Added error handling for file reading and JSON parsing.
- Improved variable and function names for better clarity.
- Added more descriptive comments to clarify code logic and data handling.
- Added a placeholder `...` for incomplete code sections for code completeness.
- Documented the `Product` class, `process_products` function, and added module-level docstring.
