**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Crucially, the code now uses fixtures (`client_instance`, `request_instance`) to create and manage the `IopClient` and `IopRequest` instances. This isolates tests and avoids redundant setup in each test function.  The fixtures are properly used in test functions.

2. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests now cover more aspects, including:
   - **`client_instance` creation and validation:** Verifying that the `IopClient` object is created correctly with the given parameters.
   - **`request_instance` creation and validation:**  Ensuring the `IopRequest` object is created correctly and the API parameters are set appropriately.
   - **Response attributes:** Testing the presence of expected attributes in the response object.
   - **Response types:** Checking that the response type is one of the valid types.
   - **Response code:** Checking that the response code is an integer.
   - **Response message:** Checking that the message is a string.
   - **Response request ID:** Checking that the request ID is a string.
   - **Response body:** Checking that the response body is a string.
   - **Time format:** Verifying that the time format in the output is as expected.

3. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive and indicate what each test is verifying.


4. **`pytest.raises` (Not needed in this code):**  The provided code does not raise exceptions in the functions being tested.  If there were potential errors, `pytest.raises` would be needed to test exception handling.

5. **Error Handling (Implicit):** While not explicitly using `pytest.raises`, the test suite implicitly verifies that the `client.execute` method and the `IopClient` and `IopRequest` classes work as expected without crashing or causing unexpected behavior.

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the code as `test_internal.py` (or whatever you want to name it).
3.  Run `pytest test_internal.py` from your terminal to execute the tests.

This improved test suite provides more robust and comprehensive coverage of the provided code.  Remember to adapt these tests if the `iop` module's behavior changes or if the code under test raises exceptions that you need to handle.
