```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.gapi.campaign_editor as campaign_editor
from unittest.mock import patch


def test_mode_default_value():
    """Tests that MODE has the default value 'dev'."""
    assert campaign_editor.MODE == 'dev'


@patch('hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.gapi.campaign_editor.SpreadSheet')
def test_import_header(mock_spreadsheet):
    """Tests import header module."""
    # We're not testing the implementation details of header.py,
    # just checking for successful import
    campaign_editor.header  # This should not raise an exception
    assert True
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Minimal Testing:** The provided code in the prompt doesn't contain any functions or methods to test.  The supplied code only contains import statements and constant definitions.  Therefore, the test cases are reduced to only testing the `MODE` variable and the import of the `header` module.  This is the *best* that can be done with the code given.

2. **`@patch` for Mocking:** The `test_import_header` function now uses `@patch` from the `unittest.mock` module. This is crucial for testing the import of `SpreadSheet` without requiring an actual `SpreadSheet` object. This way, the test doesn't depend on an external dependency being available.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are descriptive, indicating the aspect being tested.

4. **Comprehensive Testing (Where Possible):** The tests now cover the basic aspects of the code, focusing on the variables and the successful import of the necessary modules.

5. **Error Handling (where applicable):**  The original code has no functions to raise or handle errors. Thus no error handling is necessary in the tests.

6. **Fixtures (Where Needed):** Fixtures aren't needed for these simple tests.

**How to Run These Tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_campaign_editor.py`).

2. **Install pytest:** If you don't have it, run `pip install pytest` in your terminal.

3. **Run:** Execute the tests using `pytest test_campaign_editor.py` in your terminal.  This will execute the tests and report on their results.

**Important Considerations for Real Testing:**

If the `campaign_editor.py` file were to have functions involving file handling, database interaction, or external API calls, the testing should be more comprehensive and use appropriate mocks to isolate the tests from those external dependencies.  The supplied code doesn't have that functionality, so this simpler test coverage is sufficient for the given context.
