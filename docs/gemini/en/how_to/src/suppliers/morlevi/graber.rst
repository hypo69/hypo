How to use the `graber.py` code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `Graber` for extracting product data from the `morlevi.co.il` website.  It inherits from a base `Graber` class and provides methods to fetch various product attributes.  Crucially, it allows for custom data extraction logic via method overrides.  The code includes asynchronous operations, error handling, and image saving functionality. It uses a webdriver (`Driver`) for interacting with the website.  It also defines an optional decorator for closing pop-up windows before data extraction.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports various Python libraries like `asyncio`, `pathlib`, `dataclass`, `pydantic`, `functools`, and custom modules (`gs`, `header`, `product_fields`, `driver`, `jjson`, `image`, `logger`) for handling asynchronous tasks, file paths, data structures, data validation, decorators, JSON parsing, image handling, logging, and webdriver interaction.

2. **Define the `Graber` class:** This class inherits from the `Grbr` base class, providing a standardized structure for product data gathering. The `__init__` method initializes the class and sets up the supplier prefix (`morlevi`).

3. **Implement `grab_page` method:** This asynchronous method is responsible for the core data extraction logic. It fetches the product page, refreshes the page, and then calls other functions (`fetch_all_data`) to handle various data extraction tasks.  Several functions are available to extract data (eg. `id_product`, `description`, `name`), making it easy to add more specific attribute functions.


4. **Define data extraction methods:** The `grab_page` method calls various functions to extract specific product attributes. Examples include, but are not limited to: `id_product`, `description`, `name`.  These methods use the webdriver to interact with the website and extract data. Each extraction method is designed to be overridden (if necessary) by the specific supplier in an inheriting class.

5. **Implement `close_pop_up` decorator (optional):** The code includes a function `close_pop_up` that creates a decorator for closing pop-up windows. This is an optional part; if you don't need to close pop-ups, you don't have to use this decorator. It leverages `Context.driver.execute_locator` to carry out the closing actions and handles potential exceptions. This decorator would need to be used as `@close_pop_up()` before a function if pop-up handling is needed.


6. **Implement `local_saved_image` method:** This method fetches the product's default image using `execute_locator`, saves it to a temporary file in the `tmp` directory, and stores the local path in the `ProductFields` object.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.morlevi.graber import Graber
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver

    # ... (Assume you have a way to create a Driver instance)
    async def example_usage():
        driver = Driver()  # Initialize the webdriver
        await driver.start()
        try:
            graber = Graber(driver=driver)
            product_fields = await graber.grab_page(driver=driver, id_product="12345")
            print(product_fields.local_saved_image)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

        finally:
            await driver.close()

    asyncio.run(example_usage())

**Important Notes:**

* The provided example demonstrates a basic usage case.  You'll need to replace `"12345"` with the actual product ID.
* Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (e.g., `pydantic`, `selenium`, etc.) installed.
*  Make sure the `Driver` and `Context` objects are correctly initialized and used.
* The `...` sections in the code indicate parts that are not shown and require further implementation to fetch specific attributes.  The `fetch_all_data` function should call the appropriate methods.
