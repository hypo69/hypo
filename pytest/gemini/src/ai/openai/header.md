**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock `Path` objects and `gs.path.root` to simulate different scenarios. This is crucial for testing functions that rely on external resources.

* **Error Handling:** Added tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` within the setting load block.  These are essential because you cannot predict if `settings.json` will always exist or be well-formed, making robustness a necessity.

* **Edge Cases and Parameterization:** The `test_set_project_root_` tests now have more robust edge cases, including invalid file types (`int`) in the `marker_files` parameter. Parameterization with `pytest.mark.parametrize` clarifies different input possibilities.

* **Cleanup:** Added file cleanup (`temp_pyproject.unlink()`) to avoid leaving temporary test files behind.

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Improved variable names to enhance readability (e.g., `temp_pyproject` instead of just `tmp`).

* **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes various scenarios (valid input, missing files, files in parent directory, invalid input types).


**To run these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Save the test code** in a file named, for example, `test_logger_header.py` (in the same directory as the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_logger_header.py
    ```


**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs` module:** The tests now assume the `gs` module exists and has the necessary functionality (specifically, the `path` attribute).  If this is not the case, you'll need to modify or mock the parts of the `gs` module as well.
* **`__main__` block:**  If your `logger` module runs the `set_project_root` function when imported in the main script, you'll need to exclude this part from the test run to prevent unintended side effects.

This improved test suite provides a more comprehensive and robust check of the `set_project_root` function, accounting for potential errors and edge cases. Remember to adjust the paths in the tests to match your project structure. Remember to replace any placeholders like `./` with the actual path to your project. Remember to ensure the `gs` module is correctly setup if used in your function, either via import or as a fixture.
