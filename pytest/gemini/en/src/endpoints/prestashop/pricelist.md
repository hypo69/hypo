```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The crucial part is mocking the `PrestaShop` class and its `request_prices` method.  This is essential because the actual API call is not executed in unit tests and allows you to control the return values.  A mock helps isolate the `PriceListRequester` from external dependencies.
* **`@patch` Decorator:** Uses `@patch` to mock the `PrestaShop` class and its methods.
* **Clear Assertions:** Added assertions to check that the mocked `request_prices` method was called with the expected `products` and that the correct return values were received.
* **Edge Case:** Added a test `test_request_prices_invalid_input` to demonstrate handling an empty list of products as input (this might raise a TypeError).
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings to clarify the purpose of each test.
* **Stub for `modify_product_price`:** The `modify_product_price` test is a stub for now.  A complete test would mock the internal data modification.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_pricelist.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_pricelist.py`

This improved solution now demonstrates a more robust approach to testing `PriceListRequester` with minimal impact from external dependencies by using mocking. Remember to adapt the mocked return values of the calls and expectations to your specific implementation logic. Remember to also ensure that the `PrestaShop` class exists in your project and has the `request_prices` method for this code to work.
