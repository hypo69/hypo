```python
import pytest

# No functions or classes are defined in the provided code.  
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  Returning an empty test file.

# Example of how to write tests if functions were present:
# import hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains.sergey_mymaster_co_il

# def test_example_function():
#     """Example test function."""
#     assert True  # Replace with an assertion based on the function
