```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes comprehensive `try...except` blocks to catch and log exceptions during login and product data retrieval. This is crucial for robustness.  Instead of just printing an error, it now logs the details for debugging and returns `None` to indicate a serious error from `login`.  This helps prevent the script from crashing.

* **Clearer Logging:** Uses `logging` module for structured error logging.  The `logger` is taken from `settings`, which is a better practice for managing logs.

* **Docstrings:** Added informative docstrings to functions and modules, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors.  This makes the code much more readable.

* **Type Hinting (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider adding type hints to enhance readability and maintainability, especially for complex functions.  This would improve your code readability and maintainability, especially as the functions become more complex.


* **`_login` Helper Function:** Extracted the login logic into a helper function.

* **Robustness with Lists/Single Elements:** Fixed the logic for handling multiple close popup elements.

* **Logging Levels:**  Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `logger.error`, `logger.warning`, `logger.debug`) for different error types. This will help you prioritize your debugging efforts.


* **Revised `grab_product_page`:**  Improved the structure and added error handling to the `grab_product_page` function, making it more resilient to potential issues.



**Important Considerations:**

* **`wait()` calls:**  You should either use a proper `WebDriverWait` or a dedicated waiting mechanism to avoid spurious errors from missing elements.
* **`execute_locator`:**  Make sure `execute_locator` returns something meaningful if the locator fails to find an element.  For example, `None` or `False`.
* **Selenium waits:** Consider using `WebDriverWait` from Selenium for more robust element waiting.  Example:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


...
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "some_id")))
...
```


By addressing these issues, you'll create significantly more robust and reliable Python code for web scraping. Remember to install the necessary packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`.  Remember to adjust the `settings` imports to match your actual project setup. Remember to install the `selenium` library. Also, remember to configure logging appropriately in your `settings.py` file.
