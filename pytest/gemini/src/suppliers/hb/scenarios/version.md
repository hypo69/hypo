**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive, indicating the specific aspect being tested.
2. **String Type Checks:** The tests now explicitly check that `__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, and `__author__` variables are of the expected string type.  Crucially, this addresses the inherent difficulty in validating the *value* of `__name__` outside of the direct execution environment.
3. **Edge Cases:** Added a basic length check for the version string to test for possible edge cases in data format.
4. **Missing Functionality:**  The original code lacked any actual functions, making tests of the module's functionality impossible.  I added tests that cover the string checks for module attributes.
5. **Exception Handling:** The `test_function_raises_exception` example is a template.  If your original code had functions that raised exceptions, you would add tests to verify that exceptions are raised as expected with invalid inputs.
6. **MODE Test:** Includes a test for the `MODE` variable.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Modules:**

- **Actual Functionality:**  If the `version.py` file contained functions or methods, you would add test cases to verify their behavior with valid, invalid, and edge cases.
- **Fixtures:** If the test cases require data or setup, use `pytest.fixture` to create reusable test data and context.
- **Error Handling:** If your code raises exceptions, use `pytest.raises` to test exception handling.
- **Dependencies:** If `version.py` relies on external libraries, consider testing interactions with those libraries in a separate way.

Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with the appropriate test cases based on the functions and methods defined in the `version.py` file.  This improved example now addresses the practical concerns of testing module attributes. Remember to run pytest with `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.
