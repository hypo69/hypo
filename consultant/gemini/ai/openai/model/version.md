**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` and prints a more informative warning message.  Crucially, it doesn't crash the script if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted.  It also assigns an empty dictionary to `settings` in case of failure, preventing future errors.

* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` call.  This is vital for correctly handling files that might contain characters outside the ASCII range.  This is very common with settings files, so this is a must.

* **Typo correction:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"`.

* **Clearer variable names:** Using `__version__` (all caps) as a constant is conventional.

* **None Checks (Crucial):** The code now checks if `__author__`, `__copyright__`, etc., are `None` before accessing attributes. This prevents `AttributeError` exceptions if a key isn't found in the settings file.   This is a *major* improvement for robustness.

* **Improved Error Handling:** The `except` block is more robust now, and the code handles an empty dictionary in the `settings` variable.


**Why these changes matter:**

* **Robustness:** The improved error handling makes the script more resilient to unexpected file issues.
* **Readability:** The `try...except` block is better formatted and more informative.
* **Correctness:** The fix for `__copyright__` ensures the script runs correctly with a properly-named setting.
* **Security:** Checking for `None` values before accessing attributes is a basic but crucial security measure to prevent unexpected errors that could be exploited.

These changes create a more reliable and user-friendly script. Always handle potential errors gracefully in production-level code. Remember to add logging if you need more detailed error reporting. Remember that the best way to catch issues is to test your code with various invalid inputs.
