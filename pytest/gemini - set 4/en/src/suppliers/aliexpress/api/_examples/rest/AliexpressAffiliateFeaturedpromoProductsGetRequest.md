# Note: Further testing could be added to check the behavior
# of methods if there were any other methods in the class,
# particularly the RestApi inherited methods related to making API calls.

# Example of testing RestApi inherited methods, if applicable:
#  If AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest uses methods from RestApi
# to make API requests, you'd test the setup, requests made,
# and responses returned.


# Example of testing exception handling (if any). This section is empty as there is no exception handling in this class
# def test_invalid_input_raises_exception():
#     """Checks if the class raises an exception for invalid input."""
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         api_instance = AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest(domain=123)  # Example of invalid domain
#     assert "Invalid domain type" in str(excinfo.value)


# Further Testing:
# - Modify the example testing to reflect the functions
#   from the RestApi class inherited by the current class.
# - Add tests with valid and different kinds of inputs
#   for the parameters of the class.
# - Thoroughly test the usage of parameters and their impact
#   on the API calls that the class might execute.


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names now clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `test_getapiname_valid_input`).

2. **`@pytest.fixture` (Example):** A commented-out example shows how to define a fixture for test data if needed.

3. **Comprehensive Attribute Tests:** `test_init_sets_attributes_to_none` ensures that all attributes are properly initialized to `None` on object creation, a crucial aspect of the class's behavior.


4. **Domain and Port Tests:** `test_init_sets_domain_and_port` checks if the `__init__` correctly handles custom domain and port values.

5. **No Exception Handling Test (Placeholder):**  A placeholder is included for exception handling, demonstrating how to use `pytest.raises` if the class would raise exceptions for invalid parameters.


**Crucial Missing Context:**

This class inherits from `RestApi`.  To write truly effective tests, you **must** know the methods within the `RestApi` class (or access its source code).  These methods are likely how this class makes API calls to retrieve data.  Testing would need to include:

* **Mocking:** To mock the API calls and responses. You need to mock the `RestApi` methods or any other external interactions to isolate the class under test. `pytest-mock` would be invaluable for this.
* **Valid/Invalid Responses:** Test cases should cover scenarios where the API returns valid data, error codes, or different status codes.
* **Data Validation:** Testing if the received data is properly formatted and parsed.
* **Error Handling:** What if the API call fails? You'd need tests to make sure the class handles errors gracefully.


**Example with a very basic mock (using `pytest-mock`):**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
# ... other imports ...


def test_api_call_success(mock_rest_api_get):
    mock_response = {"data": "success"}
    mock_rest_api_get.return_value = mock_response
    api_instance = AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest()
    result = api_instance.api_call_method() # Replace with the actual method
    assert result == mock_response['data']


@pytest.fixture
def mock_rest_api_get(mocker):
    """Creates a mock for RestApi.get."""
    mock_object = mocker.patch('hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest.RestApi.get')
    return mock_object
```

This example shows a minimal setup for a mock. You'd replace `api_instance.api_call_method()` with the actual method of the `AliexpressAffiliateFeaturedpromoProductsGetRequest` that makes the API call.  The critical part is mocking the `RestApi.get` method (or whatever the method is). Without knowledge of the internals, extensive tests for the functionality that depends on making API calls are impossible.
