# This code snippet assumes that the modules imported above have functions
# that can be tested and that you've defined appropriate functions for testing
# the logic (such as `test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input`).

# Example test functions (replace with your actual tests):
def test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input():
    # Replace with your actual valid input (e.g., a category ID)
    category_id = 123
    # Replace with expected output if known
    expected_output = []  # Example: An empty list if no product found

    # Call the function and assert the result
    try:
        products = get_list_products_in_category(category_id)
        assert products == expected_output # or another assertion based on your logic
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")  # Handle exceptions

def test_get_list_products_in_category_invalid_input():
    # Test with invalid input (e.g., non-numeric category ID)
    category_id = "invalid"  
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
        get_list_products_in_category(category_id)
    assert "Invalid category ID" in str(excinfo.value) # Check for the specific error message

def test_get_list_categories_from_site():
    # Replace with your actual valid input and expected output
    expected_output = [] # Replace with expected output
    try:
        categories = get_list_categories_from_site()
        assert categories == expected_output # or another assertion based on your logic
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")  # Handle exceptions

def test_grab_product_page_valid_input():
    # Replace with valid URL for a product
    url = "https://example.com/product/123"
    # Replace with an expected output or an assertion
    expected_output = {} # Example: an empty dictionary for empty response

    try:
        product_page_data = grab_product_page(url)
        assert product_page_data == expected_output # or assertion based on your function's logic
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")  # Handle exceptions

def test_grab_product_page_invalid_url():
    # Test with invalid URL
    invalid_url = "invalid_url"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        grab_product_page(invalid_url)
    assert "Invalid URL" in str(excinfo.value) # Check for a specific error message

def test_login_valid_credentials():
    # Replace with valid username and password
    username = "testuser"
    password = "testpassword"
    # Replace with a way to check if login was successful
    expected_result = True # Or some other indication
    try:
        result = login(username, password)
        assert result == expected_result
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


# Example for a fixture (if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def category_data():
#     return {"id": 123, "name": "Example Category"}


# Remember to replace the placeholder comments and example data with
# your actual test logic, including handling potential exceptions.
# Include asserts based on what your functions are *supposed* to return
# and how they should behave with various inputs
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names now more accurately describe the purpose of each test (e.g., `test_get_list_products_in_category_valid_input`).

2. **Example Assertions:** Placeholder assertions (`assert products == expected_output`) are included. Replace these placeholders with your function's actual expected behavior.

3. **Exception Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used for exception testing, and assertions are added to check for the expected error messages.  Crucially, the `try...except` block catches unexpected exceptions and uses `pytest.fail` to report them.

4. **Specific Error Messages:** The tests now check for expected error messages when providing invalid data.


**How to Use with Your Code:**

1. **Import necessary functions:**  Ensure you import the functions from your `hb/scenarios` modules.

2. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the example `category_id`, `url`, `username`, `password`, and `expected_output` values with actual data relevant to your functions' inputs and expected outputs.  Be sure to test both valid and invalid input/data scenarios.


This significantly improved example demonStartes a proper approach to writing `pytest` tests. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual functions, expected outputs, and error messages, and tailor the tests to the specific logic and expected behaviors of your code. Remember to install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
