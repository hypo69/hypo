```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to effectively mock the `gs` module.  Critically, it creates and deletes the needed `.json` and `.MD` files to properly test the exception handling. This prevents the tests from depending on real files, making them more reliable and repeatable.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, emphasizing the specific scenario being tested.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover valid and invalid inputs for `set_project_root`, as well as cases where marker files are not found.

4. **Exception Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used to test the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions that the original code handles.

5. **Fixtures:** `pytest.fixture` is used to mock the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files for cleaner and more organized tests.

6. **Edge Cases:** Tests are added to cover cases where the marker file is not in the current directory, but in a parent directory, and when multiple marker files are provided.

7. **File System Interactions:** Tests involving file access (`Path`, opening files) are handled more safely and robustly using `tmp_path` from `pytest`.

8. **Correct Import:** The `import sys` line is moved into the test file, ensuring it only impacts the tests and doesn't interfere with the application's import order.

9. **Mock Gs:** The `MockGs` class is created to provide a dummy `gs` module for testing, which is crucial.

10. **Cleanup:** The `mock_settings_file` fixture now correctly deletes the file after the test.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

Remember to replace `'gs'` with the actual import of your `gs` module if it's not mocked out.  This revised solution focuses on creating a much more robust and testable suite. If you have any additional setup steps needed, please provide them so I can integrate the changes into the test suite.
