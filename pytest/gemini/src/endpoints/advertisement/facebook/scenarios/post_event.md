```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `Driver`:**  A `MockDriver` class is crucial for testing the functions without relying on an actual web driver.  The `execute_locator` method now has conditional logic to simulate success or failure.  This is a critical improvement for testability.


2. **Mock Locator:** The `mock_locator` is now set correctly (using a constant).  This means the tests no longer rely on the actual JSON file, which makes them fast, reproducible, and prevents accidental file system dependencies in your CI/CD pipeline.


3. **Clearer Assertions:**  The tests now use `assert result is True` and `assert result is None` for clear verification of expected return values.


4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The example tests now cover the potential for success and failure. It's essential to add more test cases for scenarios like:
   -  Different, but valid, input data for title, description, date, and time.
   -  Handling of invalid dates, times, or titles (edge cases).
   -  `post_event` tests covering failures at different stages.


5. **Error Handling Simulation:** The mock now simulates the `logger.error` call.  In a real test, you'd ideally capture the logged errors to verify they were raised correctly.


6. **`@pytest.fixture` for `mock_driver`:** This allows you to use the `mock_driver` easily across multiple tests without needing to create a new driver instance each time.


7. **Example test cases (Crucial):** The `test_post_title_success` and `test_post_title_failure` are essential.  Add more of these based on the scenarios in your actual code.


**How to Use (with example imports):**

```python
import pytest
import time
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.scenarios.post_event import post_title, post_date, post_event, post_description, post_time  # Adjust import path as needed.
```

Now you can run these tests with `pytest`.  Remember to replace the placeholder `some_locator` in the `MockDriver` with your actual locators.  Importantly, adapt the tests to fully cover the expected behavior of your functions based on the requirements and scenarios.
