```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive and follow a consistent naming pattern.

2. **Isolate Tests:** Each test function is independent and doesn't rely on the state of previous tests.

3. **Edge Cases:** Tests now cover cases with no marker files, marker files in the current directory, and multiple parent directories.

4. **Exception Handling (partially):** The original code had `try...except` blocks. The tests for those blocks are present, but you'll need to create dummy files to test for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` for the cases in the original file.

5. **Fixtures (not needed):** The code doesn't require fixtures as the test cases can be self-contained, so these were removed.

6. **Error Handling and File Cleanup:** Added `shutil.rmtree()` to properly clean up the dummy directories created for testing.  Crucially, this addresses potential test failures if files are not removed correctly.

**How to Run Tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
3. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_header.py
   ```

**Important Considerations for `try...except` blocks in the original code:**

To comprehensively test the `try...except` blocks, you must:

- Create a `settings.json` file in the `src` directory in your project. Example `settings.json` content:

  ```json
  {
    "project_name": "MyProject",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Test User"
  }
  ```

- Create a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory for testing `doc_str` (or any other files to test with exceptions.


- **Crucially:** You'll need to add `test_header.py` to your project's directory structure so that relative paths work when calling `get_project_root()`. The tests will work if the correct directory structure is in place.


**Remember to replace placeholders with actual file paths and data for your project.** This revised answer provides a more robust and realistic testing approach. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` in tests to match your project structure if different.
