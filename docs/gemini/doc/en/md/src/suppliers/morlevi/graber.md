# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/morlevi/graber.py

## Overview

This module defines the `Graber` class for acquiring product data from the Morlevi supplier's webpage. It utilizes asynchronous operations and integrates with various helper functions for data extraction, image saving, and exception handling.


## Classes

### `Graber`

**Description**:  This class handles the process of grabbing product fields from the Morlevi supplier's website.  It inherits from the `Grbr` class (presumably a base class for supplier grabbers).


**Attributes**:

- `supplier_prefix` (str): A string prefix identifying the supplier ('morlevi' in this case).


**Methods**:

#### `__init__(self, driver: Driver)`

**Description**: Initializes the `Graber` instance with a driver object. Sets the `supplier_prefix` and calls the parent class's `__init__` method. Initializes `Context.locator` with the `close_pop_up` locator.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The WebDriver instance used for interacting with the browser.


#### `grab_page(self, driver: Driver) -> ProductFields`

**Description**: An asynchronous function to fetch and assemble product fields.

**Parameters**:

- `driver` (Driver): The driver instance to use for grabbing.

**Returns**:

- `ProductFields`: An object containing the extracted product fields.


#### `local_saved_image(self, value: Any = None)`

**Description**: Fetches the product's default image URL from the page, saves it locally, and stores the saved image path in the `ProductFields.local_saved_image` field.  If `value` is already provided (potentially through keyword arguments in `grab_page`), it will use that value instead of fetching from the page.

**Parameters**:

- `value` (Any, optional): An optional value to use instead of fetching the image. If provided, the image is not fetched, but the value is set as `ProductFields.local_saved_image` instead. Defaults to `None`.

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: Any error during the image fetching or saving process.

## Functions

(No functions found in the file that do not belong to the `Graber` class.)


## Notes

- The code includes placeholder comments for various data fields that could be extracted.  The `fetch_all_data` function is a placeholder for the actual data retrieval logic.
- The `@close_pop_up` decorator is commented out.  If used, the decorator would attempt to close any pop-up windows before executing the decorated function.
- Extensive error handling and logging are implemented using `logger` for proper debugging and exception handling.
