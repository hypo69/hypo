Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files,
as well as retrieving video data.  It includes error handling and logging for
robust operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.
        Handles potential network issues and file saving errors.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.
        Handles file not found and read errors.


Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://example.com/video.mp4", "local_video.mp4"))
    PosixPath('local_video.mp4')  # or None if failed

    >>> data = get_video_data("local_video.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check
    b'\x00\x00\x00...'

**Changes Made:**

- Added comprehensive docstrings to the functions using the reStructuredText format, including type hints, parameter descriptions, return values, and potential exceptions.
- Improved error handling by checking for file existence and size after the download.  If a file download is empty, or the file fails to save it, None is returned.  Also, added `exc_info=True` in the `except` blocks to help with debugging.
- Replaced `json.load` with `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` (as per the instructions) - this was not possible since the provided code had no `jjson` module.
- Corrected the docstring examples to reflect the function's actual type signature.
- Improved variable names for better readability.


**Explanation of Improvements:**

The previous code lacked clear documentation and robust error handling. The updated code is now much more readable and maintainable due to the explicit docstrings in RST format.  Critically, the code now validates if the downloaded file is empty, and properly handles file-saving issues. This will prevent unexpected behavior and errors in the larger application.
