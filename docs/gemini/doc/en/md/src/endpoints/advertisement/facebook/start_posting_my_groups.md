# hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/start_posting_my_groups.py

## Overview

This module contains the logic for posting advertisements to Facebook groups (my groups). It utilizes the FacebookPromoter class to manage the advertisement campaigns across specified groups.

## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable that defines the operating mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').

### `filenames`

**Description**: A list of filenames containing the list of Facebook groups to target.

### `campaigns`

**Description**: A list of advertisement campaign names to run.


## Functions

No functions are explicitly defined in this file, but the module utilizes the `FacebookPromoter` class.

## Classes


### `FacebookPromoter`

**Description**:  This class is responsible for handling the advertisement posting process.  It is not defined within this file but utilized, likely contained within another file in the src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook directory.


## Usage Example


```python
# Example usage (assuming FacebookPromoter is defined elsewhere)
d = Driver(Chrome)
d.get_url(r"https://facebook.com")

filenames: list = ['my_managed_groups.json', ]
campaigns: list = ['brands', 'mom_and_baby', ...] # example campaigns

promoter = FacebookPromoter(d, group_file_paths=filenames, no_video=True)

try:
    while True:
        promoter.run_campaigns(campaigns=copy.copy(campaigns), group_file_paths=filenames)
        # ... additional actions
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    logger.info("Campaign promotion interrupted.")
```

**Note**:  This example assumes the `Driver`, `Chrome`, `copy`, and `logger` are defined in the appropriate modules (e.g. `src.webdriver`, `src`, `copy`, `src.logger` respectively) and that `FacebookPromoter`'s `run_campaigns` method is defined and takes appropriate parameters. The exact parameters and return values of the `run_campaigns` method would need to be referenced in the documentation for the `FacebookPromoter` class.

**Important**: The provided Python code has some missing crucial elements needed to provide complete documentation. The  `FacebookPromoter`, `Driver`, `Chrome`, `logger` and likely other modules need to be documented separately.  This documentation assumes those classes exist and have been properly documented.
