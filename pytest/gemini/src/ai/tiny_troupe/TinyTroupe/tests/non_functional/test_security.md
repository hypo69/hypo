**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `openai_utils.client()`.  This is crucial for testing functions that depend on external services or APIs without actually interacting with them. This removes the dependency on an actual OpenAI API call and allows tests to run quickly and reliably.

2. **Fixture for Mocks:** A `@pytest.fixture` called `mocked_openai_client` is defined to create and return a mocked client.  This makes the test code cleaner and more organized.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added more test cases to cover different scenarios:
   - `test_default_llmm_api_valid_response`: Tests with a valid response.
   - `test_default_llmm_api_empty_response`: Tests with an empty response content.
   - `test_default_llmm_api_none_response`:  Tests with a `None` response, using `pytest.raises` to check for the expected exception.
   - `test_default_llmm_api_invalid_response_format`:  Tests for an invalid response format (missing "content" key).


4. **Clearer Assertions:** Improved the assertion messages to be more informative about what the test is checking.

5. **Removed Unnecessary Code:** Removed the parts that printed the response as a string to the console.  Printing in tests should be kept to a minimum.  The tests should focus on verifying the return value of the function, not on outputting it.

6. **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions, making the tests more robust.

7. **Test Organization:** The tests are now better organized into individual functions for each test case.

This revised solution is significantly more robust, more efficient, and adheres to best practices for writing pytest tests. It now properly mocks the `openai_utils` function, ensuring isolated testing of the core logic. Remember to install `pytest` and `unittest.mock`.
