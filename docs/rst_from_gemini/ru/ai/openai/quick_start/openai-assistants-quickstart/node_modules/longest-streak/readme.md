## What is this?

This small package determines the length of the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of a specified substring within a string.

## Use Cases

This package is particularly useful for tasks involving:

*   **Analyzing text structure:** Identifying patterns of repeated characters or strings.  Useful for code formatting analysis or finding repeated code blocks.
*   **Markdown AST Serialization:**  As mentioned in the original description, it can be used in serializing Markdown ASTs, especially for elements like fenced code blocks or math formatting.

## Installation

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (version 14.14+ or 16.0+):**

```bash
npm install longest-streak
```

**Deno:**

```typescript
import { longestStreak } from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3';
```

**Browsers:**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { longestStreak } from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3?bundle';
  // ... use longestStreak here ...
</script>
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { longestStreak } from 'longest-streak';

const result = longestStreak('` foo `` bar `', '`');
console.log(result); // Output: 2
```

## API Reference

### `longestStreak(value, substring)`

Finds the longest streak of consecutive occurrences of `substring` within `value`.

**Parameters:**

*   `value` (string): The string to search within.
*   `substring` (string): The substring to look for.  Typically a single character, but can be any string.

**Returns:**

*   Number: The count of the longest repeating streak of `substring`.  Returns 0 if no such streak is found.

## Types

This package uses TypeScript for type definitions. No additional types are exposed beyond the function signature.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js (14.14+ and 16.0+). It also functions in Deno and modern browsers.


## Security
