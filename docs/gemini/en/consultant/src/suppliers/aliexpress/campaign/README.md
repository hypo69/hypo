```

## Changes Made

- Added RST-style docstrings to all functions.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
- Included error handling using `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except`.
- Replaced vague terms in comments with more specific descriptions (e.g., "get" to "validation").
- Added missing import statements (e.g., `from src.logger import logger`, `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns`).
- Added placeholders (`# ...`) for missing implementation details.
- Added error handling using `logger`.
- Improved variable names for better readability.
- Added type hints for function parameters and return types.
