// Check if the content is loaded.  This is a placeholder;
//  a more robust implementation would be needed.
//  This could be part of a larger check, for example, if
//  the page has not fully loaded, do not attempt the xpath check
tryxpath.isContentLoaded = function() {
    // Placeholder for actual content loading check
    return true;
};
```

# Changes Made

- Added a function `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` to encapsulate the content loading check.
- Added a placeholder implementation for `tryxpath.isContentLoaded`.
- Added a more descriptive comment explaining the purpose of the function.  It now mentions the expected purpose of a complete implementation (checking page load) which could prevent premature execution.

tryxpath.isContentLoaded = function() {
    // Placeholder for actual content loading check
    // Implement a check to see if the page has fully loaded.
    // For instance, check if all necessary DOM elements are present
    //  or if the page has finished loading according to the browser
    //  specific method.
    return true; // Placeholder - replace with actual check
