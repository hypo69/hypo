# No functions or classes provided in the code, so no tests can be written.
# The input is purely descriptive text.  Therefore, no tests are possible.
# A comment is added to highlight this limitation.

# This is a placeholder; no tests are possible with the given input.
# Commenting out to avoid misleading output
