How to use the hypotez/src/templates/__init__.py module
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python module (`hypotez/src/templates/__init__.py`) likely serves as an initialization file for a package named `hypotez`.  It defines a variable `MODE` and imports other modules, including `header` and potentially various other modules used by the `hypotez` package.  The imports also include `packaging.version` to handle versions and internal modules (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`)  likely to manage the package information and version.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Sets the `MODE` variable:**  The code initializes a variable named `MODE` to the string 'dev'. This likely indicates a development mode for the package.

2. **Imports modules:** The code imports the module `header` and several other modules that are likely involved in the `hypotez` package's functionality.  The line `from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__` is critical for package metadata.  It imports versioning, documentation, and potentially other details about the `hypotez` package.

3. **Placeholder:** The code has several multi-line string comments with placeholders for additional documentation. This suggests the module initialization is incomplete and needs further definition.

4. **Possible Future Actions:** The comment blocks after imports imply that additional functionality or operations are planned, likely relevant to the broader `hypotez` application's operation.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Import the module
    import hypotez.src.templates

    # Access the mode variable
    mode = hypotez.src.templates.MODE
    print(f"Current mode: {mode}")

    # Example demonstrating potential future usage
    # (This part is hypothetical as the code's structure is incomplete).
    # This may require further module imports from within templates.
    try:
        # ... Assuming there is a function in the module
        # for handling package versions
        version_info = hypotez.src.templates.__version__
        print(f"Package Version: {version_info}")
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(f"Error accessing version info: {e}")
