## <algorithm>

```
No complex algorithm is present.  The code defines a single function.

**Function `set_fixed_size`**

1. **Input:** A PyQt6 `QtWidgets.QWidget` object (`widget`), an integer representing the desired width (`width`), and an integer representing the desired height (`height`).
2. **Process:**  The function directly calls the `setFixedSize()` method of the `widget` object, setting its size to the given width and height.
3. **Output:** None (The function modifies the widget directly, it doesn't return anything).


```

```
## <explanation>

### Imports:

- `from PyQt6 import QtWidgets`: This line imports necessary classes from the PyQt6 library.  PyQt6 is a Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). `QtWidgets` provides classes for various GUI widgets. This import is crucial for using PyQt6's widget functionalities, like setting fixed sizes.  The relationship here is that `hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/gui` code depends on the PyQt6 library for GUI work.

### Classes:

- `QtWidgets.QWidget`: This is a base class for all widgets in PyQt6.  `setFixedSize()` is a method defined within this class. The code uses it directly; no custom class is defined.

### Functions:

- `set_fixed_size(widget: QtWidgets.QWidget, width: int, height: int)`:
    - **Arguments:**
        - `widget`: A PyQt6 widget object. This is the object whose size is to be fixed.
        - `width`: An integer representing the desired width in pixels.
        - `height`: An integer representing the desired height in pixels.
    - **Return Value:** None. The function modifies the `widget` object directly by setting its size.  It doesn't return any value.
    - **Purpose:** This function sets a fixed size for a given PyQt6 widget. This is a common utility function in GUI applications to ensure widgets maintain a specific dimension.
    - **Example:**
```python
# Assuming you have a button object:
myButton = QtWidgets.QPushButton("My Button")
set_fixed_size(myButton, 100, 50)
```
This would set the size of `myButton` to 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.


### Variables:

- `MODE`: A string variable with the value 'dev'.  This is a global variable, its purpose might be for conditional logic based on the development environment (e.g., using different styles in 'dev' vs. 'prod' mode).  Further analysis of the surrounding code would clarify this.

### Potential Errors/Improvements:

- **Type Hinting:** The use of type hinting (`widget: QtWidgets.QWidget`, `width: int`, `height: int`) is good practice.  It improves code readability and maintainability, allowing IDEs to provide better assistance and catching potential type errors.

- **Error Handling:** The `set_fixed_size` function currently doesn't contain any error handling.  If `widget` is not a valid PyQt6 widget, or if `width` or `height` are not integers, the function might crash. Adding error checks would make it more robust.  e.g., checks for `isinstance(widget, QtWidgets.QWidget)`.

- **Docstrings:** While the docstrings are present, they could be more detailed and informative. Adding examples or specific use cases to the docstrings would be beneficial.


### Relationships:

This `styles.py` file likely belongs to a larger project involving graphical user interfaces using PyQt6. Other modules in the project might use the `set_fixed_size` function from this module to style their widgets.  For example, components in  `src.suppliers.aliexpress.gui`  (or related submodules) likely utilize the functionality of this function for visual aspects of the user interface.
