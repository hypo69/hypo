```

**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints and docstrings using reStructuredText for `get_project_root`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for reading JSON files. This is a better approach for handling JSON data, especially in a more complex project.  It's essential to have the `jjson` import.
- Improved error handling. Now includes `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading `settings.json`. This prevents the script from crashing if the file is missing or corrupted. The `settings` dictionary now defaults to an empty dictionary if the file is not found, which is a better approach for robustness.
- Added `UnicodeDecodeError` handling for `README.MD` (crucial for non-UTF-8 files).
- Removed unused import `from packaging.version import Version`.
- Simplified variable naming.  Instead of `__root__`, `project_root` is used, which is more descriptive.
- More descriptive variable names and comments.


**Explanation of Improvements**:

- **Robust Error Handling:** The code now gracefully handles missing or corrupted `settings.json` and `README.MD` files, preventing unexpected crashes.
- **Clearer Docstrings:**  The docstrings are more comprehensive and use proper reStructuredText syntax.
- **Import Consistency:** The `src.utils.jjson` import is essential and now included in the code.


**Important Considerations:**

- **`src.utils.jjson`:**  Make sure you have the `jjson` module available and correctly imported into your project. This module should be in the `src/utils` directory. If it is not, implement a similar handling approach or use `json.load()` with appropriate error handling.



This revised code is significantly more robust and follows best practices for error handling and data validation.  It also enforces the use of the provided `jjson` module according to the prompt. Remember to adapt the file paths and import statements based on your project's structure.
