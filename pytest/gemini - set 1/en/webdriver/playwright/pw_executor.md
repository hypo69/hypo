```python
import pytest

# Tests for pw_executor.py

def test_mode_is_development():
    """
    Checks if the MODE constant is set to 'development'.
    """
    from hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.pw_executor import MODE
    assert MODE == 'development', f"MODE is '{MODE}', expected 'development'"
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The `from` import statement is now directly importing the specific constant from the target module.  This is crucial for testing.

2. **Assertion:** The assertion now directly compares the value of `MODE` with the expected string.  A more informative error message is given in case of failure.

3. **Testability:** The code (`hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py`) is incredibly simple.  There's *nothing* to test beyond the value of the constant.   Adding more complex functions or methods would require additional test cases.

**How to Use:**

1. **Save:** Save the test code as `test_pw_executor.py` (or a similar name).
2. **Run:**  From your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_pw_executor.py` and run `pytest test_pw_executor.py`.

**Important Considerations for More Realistic Scenarios:**

* **Modules:** If the code in `pw_executor.py` defined functions or classes, you would need to import them and test those functionalities.
* **Fixtures:** If your `pw_executor.py` code relied on external data or resources (e.g., file paths, databases), fixtures would be necessary to provide those resources during testing in an isolated way.
* **Exceptions:** You would use `pytest.raises` to test if the code handles errors correctly and, crucially, *what* exception was raised.
* **Multiple Input:** If a function accepts multiple parameters, you'd write tests to cover various combinations of valid and invalid data for each parameter.


**Example with a More Complex `pw_executor.py` (IlluStartive):**

```python
# hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py
MODE = 'development'

def launch_browser(browser_type):
    if browser_type == 'chromium':
        return "Launched chromium browser"
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported browser type")
```

```python
# test_pw_executor.py (with more tests)
import pytest
from hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.pw_executor import launch_browser


def test_launch_browser_chromium():
    result = launch_browser('chromium')
    assert result == "Launched chromium browser"


def test_launch_browser_unsupported():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        launch_browser('firefox')
    assert str(excinfo.value) == "Unsupported browser type"

```


This example now shows how to test a function (`launch_browser`) that takes input and handles exceptions.  You would adapt this structure to your actual code's complexity. Remember to adapt the imports and function calls to match your specific codebase. Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/pw_executor.py"` with the actual path to your file.
