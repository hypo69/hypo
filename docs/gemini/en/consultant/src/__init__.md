```

# Changes Made

*   Added a comprehensive module docstring using reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   Replaced the vague comment `# Initialization mode (development by default)` with a more descriptive comment.
*   Corrected and enhanced the docstring to conform to Sphinx-style RST format.
*   Added a placeholder comment `# ...` for potential future initialization or configuration tasks.
* Added an import of `os` module.  This was necessary for checking the existence of the directory.
* Removed the unused docstrings for non-existent functions.
* Removed the empty usage example.
* Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` import.  This import is essential for JSON handling.
