**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The provided code only contained imports and constants, so placeholder tests for `extract_prod_ids`, `ensure_https`, and `locales` are included.  Replace the example `url` and `expected_ids` with your actual test data and expected results.

2. **Specific Error Handling:**  `pytest.raises` is used for testing the exception handling in `ensure_https` and `extract_prod_ids`.  The error messages are checked to ensure the correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive, indicating the input and expected outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:** Tests cover valid inputs, missing product IDs, and invalid URLs.  This is crucial for comprehensive testing.

5. **Fixtures (Placeholder):**  Crucially, **no fixtures are needed** for this code because there are no functions or classes that require setup or teardown.  I've removed the placeholder fixtures.

6. **Locale Tests:** Added tests for `locales`, checking both valid and invalid locales to ensure the dictionary works correctly.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute the example data (URLs, expected results) in the placeholder tests with your actual test data and expected outcomes.

2. **Implement functions:** Make sure to define the `extract_prod_ids`, `ensure_https`, and `locales` functions or methods in your `aliexpress/utils` files.

3. **Run Tests:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_utils.py`) in the same directory as your `aliexpress/utils` module and run `pytest test_aliexpress_utils.py` from your terminal.


This revised solution provides a strong foundation for testing your `aliexpress.utils` code with proper error handling and comprehensive test coverage. Remember to adapt the example data and exception types to precisely match your actual functions. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
