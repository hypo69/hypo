```python
import pytest

def test_mode_is_development():
    """
    Tests if the MODE variable is correctly set to 'development'.
    """
    import endpoints.prestashop.domains
    assert endpoints.prestashop.domains.MODE == 'development'
```

**Explanation and Justification:**

The provided Python code (`endpoints/prestashop/domains/__init__.py`) simply defines a constant `MODE` with the value `'development'`.  There are no functions or methods to test, only a single variable.  The test above verifies that the variable has the expected value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Import:** The test imports the module using the correct path (`endpoints.prestashop.domains`).  This assumes the code is in a properly structured package.
* **Clarity:** The test function name (`test_mode_is_development`) is descriptive and clearly communicates the purpose of the test.
* **Assertion:** The assertion (`assert endpoints.prestashop.domains.MODE == 'development'`) directly checks that the value of `MODE` is as expected.
* **No Fixtures:** No fixtures are needed for this simple test.


This revised answer provides a comprehensive test suite tailored to the specific, minimal code provided.  If the code were more complex, additional, more elaborate test cases would be needed. Remember to replace `"endpoints/prestashop/domains"` with the correct path to your module if it's located elsewhere.  Crucially, run the test with `pytest` to verify that it passes.


```bash
# To run the test:
pytest -v
```
