**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Code:** The provided code was empty.  The example above now includes placeholder functions `install_chrome` and `check_chrome_installation`.  Crucially, **you MUST replace these placeholders with the actual code from your `hypotez/src/webdriver/_docs/how_to_istall_chrome_for_testing.md` file**.  The tests are now only *testing the structure*.

2. **Realistic Error Handling:** The `test_install_chrome_failure` and `test_check_chrome_installation_failure` examples now use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.  **This is essential for testing error conditions.**  Replace the placeholder error messages with the actual error messages your code would raise in a failure case.

3. **Success Cases:** The tests for success (`test_install_chrome_success` and `test_check_chrome_installation_success`) are also placeholders.  **You need to provide code and accurate assertions in these tests based on the real return values from your code.**

4. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The given prompt mentions edge cases.  **Identify and test specific edge cases** (e.g., incorrect paths, installation issues, etc.) within the actual code.

5. **Fixtures (if needed):**  If your code has dependencies (like files, temporary directories, or external resources), use pytest fixtures to manage these dependencies.  This keeps the tests isolated.


**How to Use These Tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Substitute the placeholder functions in the Python code with the actual functions from your `hypotez/src/webdriver/_docs/how_to_istall_chrome_for_testing.md` file.

2. **Run Tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


**Important:**  The tests provided are a starting point; you must tailor them to your *specific* code and expected behaviors (success, error conditions, edge cases).  Without the actual code from the Markdown file, these tests are incomplete and will likely fail. Remember to handle potential `FileNotFoundError`, `subprocess` errors, and other issues that may arise during the installation process. Be very careful when writing tests around installing software (especially if it involves external dependencies).  Error handling and appropriate exception testing are paramount.
