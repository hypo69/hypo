```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Structure:** The tests are now more organized, with functions for each specific test case.  This is crucial for maintainability.

2. **`__version_getter` Helper:** This helper function allows for a clean, DRY approach to testing functions that read JSON.  This isolates the test from the file loading logic.

3. **Edge Cases (Invalid JSON):** Added a test specifically for `json.JSONDecodeError` to verify the error handling when `settings.json` contains invalid JSON.

4. **Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to verify that the code correctly handles `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.

5. **Temporary File:** Now uses a temporary settings.json file for testing to avoid side effects and clean up afterward (essential for CI).  I've used `os.remove` to delete the file in each test function so this cleanup is automatic

6. **Direct Settings Access:**  Instead of relying on external side effects, I use `ver.settings = settings_data` to set the `settings` variable, making the testing more direct.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_version.py`) in the same directory as your `version.py` file or adjust the import paths as needed.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_version.py
    ```


This revised solution provides comprehensive tests, handles edge cases effectively, and ensures a more robust testing strategy for the `version.py` code. Remember to adapt the file paths if your project structure differs. Remember to create a dummy `settings.json` file in the same directory as the test file.
