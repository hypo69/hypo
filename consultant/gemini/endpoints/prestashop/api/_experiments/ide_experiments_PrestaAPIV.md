**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block. This is *essential* for robust code.  It catches `PrestaShopAuthenticationError` specifically, which gives you more context about the problem, and a general `Exception` block to catch other potential issues.

* **Informative error messages:**  Prints informative error messages to the console, telling you *why* the initialization failed.  This is critical for debugging.

* **Appropriate action on errors:** The example now shows how to handle authentication errors.
    * You can `raise` the exception to let the calling function handle it.
    * You can `exit` the script to prevent further execution with a bad connection.  *This is often a better choice than silently failing.*
    * Or you can log the error and try again or perform other specific recovery actions.  You need to decide what to do when authentication fails.

* **No `...`:** The example now has an explicit `# ... rest of your code ...` which was crucial. This emphasizes the importance of the error handling.

* **Explicit error handling for other potential issues:** The `except Exception as e` block is included to also catch errors like incorrect credentials or network issues.

**How to use it:**

1.  **Identify the error:** If `PrestaShopAuthenticationError` is raised, investigate the PHP configuration on the PrestaShop server.  Check for correct API keys, user permissions, and any related settings.


2.  **Adapt the handling:** The `except` block gives you an opportunity to customize what happens when an exception occurs:
    * **Logging:**  You should always log errors for debugging purposes.
    * **Retry mechanism:** If the error is transient, consider adding a retry mechanism.
    * **Alerting:**  Notify the system administrator or send an email in case of errors.


**Crucial Next Steps (not in the code snippet itself):**

*   **Logging:**  Integrate robust logging. Use a logging library (e.g., Python's built-in `logging` module) to record error details, timestamps, and potentially the API requests and responses, so you can track what's going wrong when you encounter errors.


This improved version makes the script much more reliable and easier to debug.  Remember to replace the comments with the appropriate actions for your application.
