Module for Code Processing and Documentation Generation
=========================================================

This module provides functionality for analyzing code files and generating documentation.

It leverages various AI models like Google Gemini for enhanced processing capabilities.

Usage Example

.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage, replace with actual code
    assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='en', model=['gemini'])
    assistant.process_files()

# Changes Made

- Added missing imports (e.g., `from src.logger import logger`, `import os`).
- Added RST-style docstrings for the `CodeAssistant` class and the `process_files` method.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON handling.
- Added error handling with `logger.error` instead of bare `try-except` blocks. This improves error logging.
- Added placeholder comments for missing file reading and processing steps.
- Changed the documentation style to comply with the provided Markdown format specifications, using reStructuredText (RST) within docstrings.
- Added example usage in RST format with `.. code-block:: python`.
- Corrected function parameters and return types to conform to the example.
- Added exception handling to catch `FileNotFoundError` and log an error message.
- Added a catch-all `except Exception as e` block for robust error handling.
- Created a placeholder for the `processed_data` to reflect the needed AI processing.
