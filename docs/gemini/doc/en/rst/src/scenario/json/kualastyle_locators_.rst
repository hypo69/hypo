kualastyle_locators_
=====================

This file contains locators for various elements on a website, categorized by section.  Each locator defines the element's attribute, selection method (e.g., XPath, CSS selector), and associated actions.  The JSON structure maps sections (like "main menu" or "product") to specific element information.

    Args:

        dict | None: The parsed JSON data if successful, otherwise None.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file does not exist.
        json.JSONDecodeError: If the JSON file has an invalid format.

# Example usage (assuming you have a 'kualastyle_locators_.json' file)

# if locators_data:
#     print(locators_data)

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

*   **`load_locators` function:** Added a function to load the JSON data. This is crucial for error handling and reusability.  It now includes `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, providing informative error messages.  Importantly, `ex` is used instead of `e` as requested in the prompt for exception handling.


*   **`index.rst` placeholder:** The `index.rst` file now has placeholders to link to the different sections of the locator data. This is necessary for a complete and useful documentation structure.



*   **Clearer Structure:** The `.rst` file now has a better structure, clearly separating different sections of the locators, making it easier to navigate and understand.



*   **`automodule` directives:** Included `.. automodule::` directives to automatically document the Python classes and functions, following the example from the prompt.


*   **Missing Python file:** The Python file `kualastyle_locators.py` is added to act as a placeholder for the actual logic of loading and potentially using the locators.  It is crucial to populate it with the correct logic for your project.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Populate `kualastyle_locators.py`:** Complete the `load_locators` function to handle parsing of the JSON data and optionally add functions to use the loaded locators.
2.  **Adapt `index.rst`:**  Modify the `index.rst` file to create a table of contents that correctly links to your individual locator sections.
3.  **Testing:** Add test cases to `kualastyle_locators.py` to validate the `load_locators` function against various JSON structures.

This enhanced response directly addresses the requirements outlined in your instructions. Remember to fill in the code for `kualastyle_locators.py` with the appropriate parsing and usage logic to make your locators operational. Remember to put your json file in the `hypotez/src/scenario/json/` directory for it to be found.
