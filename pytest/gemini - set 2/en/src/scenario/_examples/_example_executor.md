```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_supplier` fixture to create instances of `MockSupplier` and manage test data. This is crucial for isolating tests.  Also added `product_fields` to reduce code duplication and improve readability.


2. **Specific Assertions:**  Replaced placeholders like `assert result` with more meaningful assertions.  For example, in `test_run_scenario_files_success`, checking if the result is `True` is not sufficient; a more specific test (e.g., verifying if the scenarios were processed) would be better.


3. **Error Handling:** Added `pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError)` for testing the failure case of `run_scenario_file`. This is a much better way to handle expected exceptions in your tests.


4. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are now more descriptive and accurately reflect the test's purpose.


5. **Mock Data:** The `MockSupplier` now creates `scenario_files` within the fixture for more controlled testing.


6. **Example 5 (add_coupon):**  Crucially, this example cannot be directly tested, as it interacts with an external API.  This test is commented out for now, because there's no way to validate the API call itself, and this is generally an area that would use a mocking framework.



**To run the tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_example_executor.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_example_executor.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Mocking External Dependencies:** For `add_coupon`, you'll need to mock the PrestaShop API. Using a mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` would be the best approach to isolate and control the API interaction during testing.

*   **Asynchronous Tests:** The `async` test needs to be awaited for proper execution. Remember to use `asyncio.run(test_function())` when running the test.

*   **Real Data:** If you want to test with actual data, modify the `MockSupplier` to load data from your scenario files. Make sure you have the correct file paths.  Also think about managing the file system so you don't contaminate or overwrite your scenario files during testing.  Consider using temporary directories for testing to avoid issues with accidental file modification.
