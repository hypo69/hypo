**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `mock_settings`, `mock_settings_file`, and `test_dir` fixtures to create test data more easily.  `test_dir` is crucial for simulating project structure.
2. **Clearer Test Names:** Improved test names for better understanding.
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Added tests for cases where the marker file isn't found, is in a subfolder, or in a parent folder.
4. **Exception Handling (Crucial):** Added tests to cover `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in the actual code, simulating the error conditions.  The original test cases would have crashed if these errors were present.
5. **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Used `pytest.tmp_path` for temporary directories for creating mock files, preventing interference between tests.
6. **File Existence Assertions:** Assertions are now more precise.  Instead of just checking for equality, the code now uses `assert str(project_root) in sys.path` to ensure the path is correctly added to `sys.path`.
7. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Tests cover valid input scenarios, cases with no matching files, and files in subfolders/parent folders.
8. **Error Handling:**  The tests now robustly handle `FileNotFoundError` when creating mock files, simulating real-world conditions.

This revised solution is much more comprehensive and robust, ensuring the `set_project_root` function behaves correctly in various situations. Remember to install the required packages (`pytest`, `packaging`) if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
