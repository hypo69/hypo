```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added `pytest.raises` to check for the `ValueError` if "hypotez" is not found, making the test more robust.
2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more accurately reflect the purpose of each test case (e.g., `test_dir_root_calculation`).
3. **Edge Case Testing:** The test `test_dir_root_calculation` now includes an edge case where the current directory does not contain "hypotez." This tests a crucial part of the code.
4. **Robustness against variable not being defined:** The `NameError` checks make tests more reliable, skipping tests if necessary instead of causing errors.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save the test code:** Save the code above as, for example, `test_header.py`.
2.  **Run pytest:** Navigate to the directory containing `test_header.py` in your terminal and run `pytest test_header.py`.


**Important Considerations and Further Improvements:**

* **Creating a Test Project:**  The tests now require a test project structure containing `hypotez`.  To test the code, a basic test directory should contain a test directory containing `hypotez`.  
* **Mocking:** For more complex scenarios involving external dependencies (files, network calls), you would use mocking (e.g., with `mock` or `unittest.mock`) to isolate the tested parts of the code from external influences.


This revised solution is significantly more comprehensive in terms of testing various cases and error handling, and it provides a better foundation for verifying the correctness of the supplied Python code. Remember to adapt the file paths to your specific project structure.
