```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  The provided HTML is just a webpage,
# not a Python module.

# Example demonstrating how tests would look if there was Python code:

# def test_some_function(some_fixture):
#     """Tests the 'some_function' with a valid input."""
#     result = some_function(some_fixture)
#     assert result == expected_output  # Replace with appropriate assertion

# def test_some_function_invalid_input():
#     """Tests the 'some_function' with an invalid input."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):
#         some_function("invalid_input") # Replace with actual invalid input

# def test_some_function_edge_case():
#     """Tests the 'some_function' with an edge case."""
#     result = some_function("edge_case_input")
#     assert result == expected_edge_case_output # Replace with appropriate assertion


# Example of a fixture (if needed):
# @pytest.fixture
# def some_fixture():
#     """Provides a fixture value."""
#     return 10
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) is a webpage, not Python code.  Therefore, there's no Python code to test.  My response above is an example of how pytest tests would be structured *if* you had Python code, such as a function to interact with or process the HTML content.

To write effective tests:

1. **Identify the Python Code:**  You *must* have Python functions, classes, or modules that interact with the HTML file (e.g., scraping data, manipulating elements, etc.) to write *any* tests.

2. **Focus on Behavior, Not Presentation:** Test the *behavior* of your Python code, not the visual presentation of the HTML.  Verify that your Python code correctly handles inputs, outputs, and error conditions.

3. **Test Data:**  Create appropriate test data, both valid and invalid, to exercise various parts of your Python code.

4. **Error Handling:**  If your Python code raises exceptions, test for that using `pytest.raises`.

5. **Edge Cases:**  Think about unusual or extreme inputs, input formats, or scenarios that might not be obvious.  These are crucial for testing robustness.


**Example of how to use this response correctly:**

If you had the following Python code:


```python
import requests

def get_page_title(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        raise Exception(f"Error fetching URL: {e}")
```


You could then write tests like this:


```python
import pytest
import requests

def test_get_page_title_valid_url():
    title = get_page_title("https://www.example.com")
    assert title is not None
```


Remember to replace the example code with your actual Python code to write meaningful tests. Provide the Python code and I can provide more targeted test cases.
