```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily utilizes `unittest.mock`. This is essential for isolating tests from external dependencies (like file systems, network requests, the Facebook API, etc.).  The example shows mocking `run_campaign` and `get_directory_names`.  Critically, mock the `Driver` and `FacebookPromoter` to avoid actually interacting with the Facebook API.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:** Tests are more focused and have descriptive names.  The `test_campaign_cycle_no_campaigns` test is a good example of how to test error conditions.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_run_campaign_invalid_campaign_type` test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.

4. **Fixtures:** The `mock_driver` fixture is introduced to properly set up the mock objects and avoid test coupling.

5. **Completeness:**  Crucially, the `test_campaign_cycle_valid_input` and `test_campaign_cycle_no_campaigns` now mock the critical `run_campaign` function so you aren't actually interacting with Facebook, instead of just checking if the function is called.  This example shows how to make the test isolate the logic of `campaign_cycle` and not rely on external function calls.


**How to use:**

1.  **Install pytest:** If you don't have it already:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Place the tests in a file:** (e.g., `test_start_sergey.py`)

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_start_sergey.py
    ```


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Replace the mock objects:**  The provided mocks (`MockDriver`, `MockFacebookPromoter`) are placeholders. You need to adapt them to reflect the actual structure of your classes and functions.  In particular, mocking how `run_campaigns` (and potentially other functions) handles input will be vital.
*   **Mock External Dependencies:**  Ensure you mock any external dependencies. Your test will not work if it tries to actually interact with files or web servers.


This improved solution addresses the key issues with the original test cases, making them more robust, reliable, and easier to maintain.  Remember to replace the mock objects with your actual dependencies, where appropriate. Remember to adapt the mocks (`MockDriver`, `MockFacebookPromoter`) to your project structure. Remember to adapt the mock objects to your project structure.
