**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`mock_file_system` Fixture:** This fixture now correctly creates the necessary files and directories within a temporary directory using `tmp_path`.  This isolates the tests and avoids interfering with the system's file structure.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  The test names are more descriptive, specifying the input conditions.
* **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Tests cover cases with the marker file in various levels (current, parent) and when no marker file is found, handling empty marker list as well as cases where the root is already in sys.path.
* **Edge Case Tests:** Added tests for scenarios where the marker file might be in a subdirectory or when no marker files are found.
* **Correct Assertion:** The assertions now check for the expected path instead of just the boolean result, which provides more useful feedback in case of failures.
* **`pytest.raises` (not needed here):**  Since `set_project_root` is designed to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` gracefully, no `pytest.raises` is necessary for exception handling in these tests. Instead, the tests are designed to verify the correct return value in expected and error scenarios.
* **Import correction:**  `sys` was imported in the test now.
* **System Path Test:** Includes a test to verify if the function adds the path to `sys.path`.
* **Missing `sys` import:** The `import sys` statement was missing in the original file, and it's now correctly added.

This significantly improved test suite provides more comprehensive coverage and checks for crucial error cases, ensuring the robustness of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to replace `hypotez` with the actual package name if it differs.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.


This revised response addresses the crucial aspects of robust test writing for the given function. Remember to adapt the fixture and test names if your project structure is different.  This updated structure is more maintainable and comprehensive.
