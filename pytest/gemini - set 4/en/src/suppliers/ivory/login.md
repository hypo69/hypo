```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Tests:** The example tests are placeholders.  Crucially, you **must** replace these with actual tests that *call* the functions in `login.py`.  The provided `login.py` has no functionality, so the examples test for potential errors.

2. **Error Handling (`pytest.raises`):** The tests now demonstrate proper use of `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (ValueError, TypeError) raised by the `login` function in the `login.py` file when conditions are not met.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names are descriptive and indicate the scenario being tested.

4. **Comprehensive Error Cases:** The tests now include more edge cases like empty strings, None values, and incorrect data types for username and password.  This is vital for robust testing.

5. **Data-Driven Tests (If Applicable):**  If `login.py` takes parameters or has a database interaction, data-driven tests would be better.

6. **Missing `login.py`:**  The solution assumes you'll provide the actual `login.py` file's content, and it demonstrates the structure needed to write *correct* tests against that code.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Put your actual `login.py` code into the `input_code` section.
2. **Modify Tests:** Modify the example test functions to call the functions defined in `login.py` and test the expected behavior. Replace the example credentials (`"valid_username"`, `"valid_password"`) with your actual credentials if possible.
3. **Run Tests:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_login.py`), and run `pytest test_login.py` in your terminal.


This revised response provides a significantly more useful and practical approach to writing tests, given the limitations of the initial prompt.  **The actual test content heavily depends on the functionality of the `login.py` code.**
