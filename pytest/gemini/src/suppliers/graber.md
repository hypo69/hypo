**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `Driver`:** Created a `MockDriver` class to mock the `Driver` object. This is crucial for testing the `Graber` class without relying on a real browser driver.  The mock returns specific values for different locators, allowing for targeted tests.

2. **Mock `locator` file:**  The `graber` fixture now creates a temporary JSON file (`product.json`) containing mock locator data. This is crucial for tests to work correctly.

3. **`@pytest.fixture` for `Graber`:**  The `graber` fixture now correctly prepares a `Graber` instance using the mock driver and the temporary locator file.  This isolates each test from needing to setup the driver, etc., for each test case.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included tests for `name`, `additional_shipping_cost`, `delivery_in_stock`, covering valid input and handling of `None` inputs.  Crucially, there's a test that verifies a value is used if it's provided.

5. **Error Handling Tests:** Added a test (`test_error_handling`) to verify that the `error` method is called appropriately when a locator doesn't exist.

6. **`close_pop_up` decorator test:** Added tests for `close_pop_up` decorator. The test checks that the `close_pop_up` decorator correctly wraps the function (`test_close_pop_up_decorator`).  Added another test (`test_close_pop_up_decorator_execute_locator_exception`)  that verifies exception handling of `execute_locator`. This is important because it checks the real-world error-handling mechanism.

7. **`asyncio.run`:**  All `async` functions are now run using `asyncio.run` within the test functions.

8. **Clearer Comments:** Added more descriptive comments to explain the logic of each test.

9. **`tmp_path` fixture:** The `tmp_path` fixture is used to create temporary directories, which is good practice to avoid file collisions and cleanup.

**How to Run:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Save the test code as `test_graber.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `graber.py` file.

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest test_graber.py
   ```


This improved solution addresses the critical issue of mocking the dependencies (driver and locator file) to create isolated and reliable tests. It's much more robust and comprehensive than the previous attempt. Remember to replace placeholders with actual locator data for real-world testing.  Also, make sure your `gs` module and `ProductFields` are defined and functional as well as any other dependencies used.
