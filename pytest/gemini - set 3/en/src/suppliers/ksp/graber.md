**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Necessary Classes:**  The code now correctly imports the necessary classes (`Graber`, `Context`, `close_pop_up`, `ProductFields`, etc.) directly from the specified module.

2. **Mock Driver:** A `mock_driver` fixture is created to simulate the `Driver` object. This is crucial for testing asynchronous functions, preventing actual interactions with a browser.

3. **Mock Graber:**  A `graber` fixture creates an instance of `Graber` using the mock driver.  This isolates the tests.

4. **Mock `ProductFields`:** A `product_fields` fixture creates a sample `ProductFields` object for testing.  This is essential for testing return values.

5. **Asynchronous Test Functions:**  All tests are properly asynchronous using `asyncio.run()`.

6. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are more specific and verify that the returned `ProductFields` object is of the expected type and contains the expected data (e.g., `result.name == "Test Product"`).

7. **Exception Handling:** The `test_grab_page_invalid_input` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check if the expected exception (`AttributeError`) is raised, making it more robust. This is extremely important because the original code might have uncaught exceptions.


8. **Edge Case `test_grab_page_edge_case_no_data`:** This test handles the situation where functions inside `grab_page` might return `None` (or raise errors) as expected.

9. **`test_close_pop_up_successful` and `test_close_pop_up_error`:** These tests are crucial for verifying the `close_pop_up` decorator's behavior in both successful and error scenarios.

**Crucial Considerations:**

* **`id_product` and other methods:** The tests now assume that other functions like `id_product` (and others in `fetch_all_data`) also *might* return data. Modify the assertions (and potential mock behavior) to align with what you *expect* each specific function to return.

* **Dependencies:** Ensure that the `src` and `src.suppliers` packages, including all the modules and classes mentioned in the input code, are properly imported and configured in your test environment.

* **Real Driver (if necessary):** If you need to interact with a real WebDriver, adjust these tests accordingly.  Use `pytest-asyncio` for running these tests effectively.

* **Missing Context:** You likely need a `Context` object or the `Context` class needs to be set up to initialize the functions correctly for your test cases.

This revised example provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests that cover various scenarios and potential issues, crucial for ensuring your code works as intended.  Remember to adapt the assertions and mock behavior based on the specific return values of your functions. Remember to install `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` if you haven't already.
