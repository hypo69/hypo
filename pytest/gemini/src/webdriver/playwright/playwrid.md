**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the `logger` to avoid needing a real logger for testing.  Crucially, the `mock_logger` function is defined, ensuring consistent logger setup.  
* **`temp_settings_file` Fixture:**  Creates a temporary JSON file for settings, significantly improving testability by eliminating reliance on external files.  This is much cleaner than using a fixed path.
* **`mock_playwrid` Fixture:** Simplifies creating the Playwrid object for testing.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for `test_playwrid_valid_initialization`, `test_playwrid_custom_settings`, `test_playwrid_no_custom_settings`, covering different scenarios for initialization and custom settings.
* **Invalid Input Handling:** A crucial addition is `test_playwrid_invalid_settings_name` to demonstrate exception handling when a custom settings file doesn't exist or has a problematic format.
* **Mocking `run`:** Now mocks `PlaywrightCrawler.run` in `test_playwrid_start` and `test_playwrid_start_failure` for isolation.
* **Error Handling Test:** `test_playwrid_start_failure`  demonstrates error handling during the `start` method, using `pytest.raises` to verify the expected exception.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more focused and descriptive.
* **Import Fix:** Corrected the import statement to import the `Playwrid` class directly, avoiding potential issues with relative imports.


This improved solution addresses the requirements, provides better test coverage, and uses mocking effectively to isolate the tests. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `pathlib`, etc. Also, adapt the `gs.path.src` part to correctly reflect the actual path to your project's source directory.  Importantly, `j_loads_ns.dumps()` was added to handle potential serialization issues.  Finally, using `monkeypatch` to mock `run` is the correct way to test the external method call; other approaches would be less safe.


Remember to replace placeholders like `gs.path.src` with your actual path if necessary.
