**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and focused on the specific aspects being tested.

2. **Dummy Files:** The tests now create temporary files to simulate the presence of marker files, ensuring the functions work correctly with the expected inputs.  Crucially, these files are removed after the test to avoid interfering with other tests or the test environment.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_set_project_root_marker_file_not_found` test is crucial as it verifies the correct handling when the marker files don't exist.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover various scenarios:
   - Valid marker files in the same directory.
   - Valid marker files in a subdirectory.
   - No marker files present.
   - Invalid marker types (ensured via `pytest.raises(TypeError)`).

5. **Isolated Tests:** Each test function is self-contained and doesn't rely on the state of other tests.

6. **Edge Case:** The `test_set_project_root_marker_in_subdirectory` test ensures the function correctly handles cases where the marker file is located in a subdirectory.

7. **Robustness:** Removed unnecessary `__root__` variable from the test functions.



**How to Run:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

**Important Considerations for Further Testing:**

* **`settings.json` and `README.MD` Loading:** Add tests to verify the correct loading of `settings.json` and `README.MD`, including handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Use similar dummy file creation and cleanup techniques as demonstrated in the example test.
* **Data Validation:**  Add tests to validate the structure and content of the loaded data (e.g., checking if `settings` has the expected keys).
* **External Dependencies:** If the functions rely on other external libraries (like `gs` in your code), ensure the tests correctly mock these or create appropriate test environments.


By addressing these, your test suite will be significantly more robust and comprehensive. Remember to adapt the example tests to match the specific functionality of the functions in `header.py`.
