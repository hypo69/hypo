**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`__name__` Testing:** The original test for `__name__` is flawed because `__name__` is dependent on how the module is called.  The improved test now uses `monkeypatch` to set `__name__` inside the test function, simulating different execution scenarios.


* **Type Checking:**  Added type checks for `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__annotations__`, `__author__`, and `MODE` (if it exists) to ensure the attributes have the expected types.

* **Handling Missing Attributes:**  Uses `hasattr()` to gracefully handle cases where `MODE` might not be defined in the code.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_version_attribute_type`).

* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover the `__version__`, `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__annotations__`, `__author__`, and (if present) `MODE` attributes.

* **Example for a real function (if needed):** If the module had functions or methods, you'd add tests that verify those functions against valid/invalid/edge cases for example:


```python
def test_my_function_valid_input():
    #  Test with valid input to see if it returns expected values
    result = version.my_function(valid_input)
    assert result == expected_output

def test_my_function_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        version.my_function(invalid_input)
```

Remember to adapt the test cases to the actual functions and attributes in your code.  This example focuses on the attributes you specified in the question. Remember to install `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
