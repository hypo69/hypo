# PrestaShop Warehouse Endpoint

## Overview

This module provides a class `PrestaWarehouse` that inherits from the `PrestaShop` class, likely for interacting with the warehouse endpoints of a PrestaShop API.  It handles interactions with the warehouse resources, potentially including methods for listing, creating, updating, and deleting warehouse information.


## Classes

### `PrestaWarehouse`

**Description**: This class inherits from `PrestaShop` and extends functionality for interacting with PrestaShop warehouse endpoints.  It likely encapsulates methods for managing warehouse data.


**Methods**:


This class inherits methods from the `PrestaShop` class and does not explicitly define any methods within this current snippet. Additional methods related to warehouse operations would need to be examined in the complete implementation of `PrestaWarehouse`.


## Functions

This file does not define any functions.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: A string variable defining the current operational mode (e.g., 'dev', 'prod').  Its value is set to 'dev'.

### `logger`

**Description**: A potentially global logger object, likely used for capturing and recording events and data during execution.  (Import statement indicates it's from `src.logger`.)

This section requires further context to provide detailed descriptions of any `logger` specific functionality if it is utilized.


## Imports

This section lists the imported modules and classes.

- `os`, `sys`: Standard Python modules for operating system interaction and command-line arguments.
- `attr`: A library likely for specifying and handling attributes in a structured manner, similar to dataclasses.
- `pathlib`: The `pathlib` module for working with file paths in an object-oriented manner.
- `header`: A module potentially for importing header files or configurations. This module's functionality needs additional examination.
- `gs`: A module (`src.gs`) for potentially accessing Google services.  This import statement indicates a dependency on Google Services in the larger application. Further details are required to describe its functionality.
- `pprint`: A module (`src.utils`) for pretty-printing data structures, likely for output formatting.
- `PrestaShop`: A class, likely from `src.endpoints.prestashop.api` for interacting with the PrestaShop API.


## Usage Notes

This `warehouse.py` module is incomplete and requires additional context from the complete implementation to provide more detailed documentation. The `...`  indicates a significant portion of the class definition and the inheritence behavior is not documented here.  Further documentation should describe the expected methods of `PrestaWarehouse`  based on the inherited `PrestaShop` class and intended usage.

To document this module thoroughly, the complete implementation of the `PrestaWarehouse` class and its intended use cases need to be reviewed.
