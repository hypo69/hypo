How to use the FacebookFields class
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a `FacebookFields` class.  It's designed to load Facebook advertisement and event fields from a JSON file (`facebook_feilds.json`) located in a specific directory structure.  The class then populates itself with these fields as attributes.  If the JSON file is not found or improperly formatted, it logs a debug message and returns without populating the object.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `Path` object from `pathlib`, the `j_loads` function from `src.utils.jjson`, `logger` from `src.logger`, and likely other modules from the `src` package (based on the `from src import gs` line).


2. **Define the `FacebookFields` class:** This class is created to handle Facebook fields.


3. **Initialize the class (`__init__`)**: The `__init__` method is defined, but it contains an empty `...` which suggests further functionality, potentially including initialization steps not fully shown here. Crucially, this method invokes the `_payload` method to load the data.


4. **Load data from the JSON file (`_payload`)**: The `_payload` method attempts to load the `facebook_feilds.json` file located under the `src/advertisement/facebok` directory using the `gs.path.src` path variable. It then parses the JSON content to a Python dictionary using `j_loads`.


5. **Error handling:** If the JSON file is missing or has invalid data, it logs a debug message and immediately returns without any further operation, avoiding an error.


6. **Populate class attributes:** If the JSON loading succeeds, the code iterates through the loaded data. For each key-value pair, it sets the key as an attribute of the `FacebookFields` object using `setattr`.


7. **Return success status:** If the process completes successfully (JSON loads and attributes are successfully set), the method returns `True`.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.facebook_fields import FacebookFields
    import src.gs as gs
    
    # This example assumes you have a file named facebook_feilds.json
    # in the src/advertisement/facebok directory with properly formatted data.
    # Modify the path below if needed.
    
    # Set your path to src folder
    gs.path.src = "path/to/your/src/directory" 
   
    
    facebook_fields = FacebookFields()

    if facebook_fields:
        print(f"Facebook fields loaded successfully. 'category' field: {facebook_fields.category}") 
        
        # You can now access attributes like:
        # facebook_fields.category
        # facebook_fields.location
        # ...

        # Do something with loaded data, e.g., use them in your ads.
        # Use values to build your ad payloads.
