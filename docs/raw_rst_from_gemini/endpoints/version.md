__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now includes a `print` statement to inform the user if `settings.json` is not found or invalid.  This is crucial for debugging.  Consider raising an exception (`raise FileNotFoundError(...)` or similar) instead of just printing a warning, especially in a production environment, to stop the script if the critical configuration file is missing.
* **Typo Correction:** Fixed a typo in `__copyright__` from `__copyrihgnt__` to `__copyright__`.
* **Variable Naming:** Made `__version__` a string variable as per PEP 8 naming conventions. Using the same naming conventions throughout the code increases readability and maintainability.
* **Clarity and Maintainability:**  The use of descriptive variable names and comments help others and future you understand the code better.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** (Minor but important)  Using lowercase for `__version__` and other variables, and the appropriate use of spaces around operators.
* **Robustness (important):**  The handling of `settings.json` not existing is improved.   If `settings.json` is missing, you might want your application to gracefully handle it, or raise an exception.  A print statement is good for development but may not be suitable for production environments.

**How to Use:**

This `version.py` file can be imported into other Python modules and accessed like this:


```python
import hypotez.src.endpoints.version as version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
```


This approach allows the version information to be readily available and consistent throughout your project. Remember to adjust the import path if your project structure is different.


**Important Considerations (for Production):**

* **Exception Handling:** If you want to gracefully handle the case where `settings.json` is not present, you should modify the `try...except` block.

```python
try:
    # ... (your code to read settings)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Warning: settings.json not found. Using default values.")
    # Set default values for your settings
    settings = {
        "project_name": "hypotez",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        # ... other default settings
    }
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
     print(f"Error decoding settings.json: {e}")
     # handle the error (e.g., log the error, use defaults, exit)
     raise  # re-raise the exception for further handling
```

Choosing between raising an exception or setting defaults depends on your application's requirements. Raising exceptions signals an error that needs to be addressed, while defaults provide a fallback.


```python
raise FileNotFoundError("settings.json not found")

```
