**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Realistic Example:** The code now includes a hypothetical `download_file` function simulating a file download.  Critically, it uses a `try...except` block to handle potential errors, which is essential in real-world scenarios.

2. **Error Handling Tests:** The tests now include `test_download_file_invalid_url` and `test_download_file_io_error` to verify that the function correctly raises `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError` for appropriate input conditions, demonstrating exception handling.

3. **Edge Case (Filename with Spaces):**  A test `test_download_file_filename_with_space` verifies handling of filenames containing spaces. This is a common edge case.

4. **Directory Creation:** `test_download_file_existing_directory` tests if the directory is created if it doesn't exist, making the code more robust.


5. **Teardown:** The `teardown_module` function is crucial. It removes the temporary `test_files` directory after each test suite run, preventing file clutter and ensuring clean test results.  It's wrapped in a `try...except` block to handle potential issues with file removal.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_download.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_download.py`


Remember to replace the placeholder download logic with your actual implementation if you're downloading from a real website.  This comprehensive example now demonstrates good error handling and covers valid, invalid, and edge cases. Remember to adapt the test cases to fit the specific functions and classes you want to test in your actual code.
