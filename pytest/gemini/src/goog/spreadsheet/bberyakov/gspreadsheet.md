**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses a `MockSpreadsheet` class to mock the `Spreadsheet` class.  This is crucial for testing because it avoids interacting with the actual Google Sheets API, which requires authentication and is slow.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The test cases now include more thorough checks for valid and invalid inputs, edge cases (empty strings, `None` values for `sh_title`), and more thorough assertions.
* **Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used for testing exception cases.
* **Parametrization:** The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to test `get_by_title` with various inputs (including empty strings and `None`).
* **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are now more specific and verify the expected behavior.
* **Dummy JSON File:**  The `test_get_project_spreadsheets_dict` now creates a dummy JSON file to avoid needing a real one for testing. This is a crucial step for testing.
* **Realistic Error Cases:** The test now has parametrized tests to check for various invalid inputs, like passing empty strings or `None` values.

**Important Considerations:**

* **`global_settingspread`:**  Make sure the `global_settingspread` module (and any other external modules) are available to the test file.
* **Replace the Mock:** Replace the `MockSpreadsheet` with a better mock if you have more complex interactions with the underlying `Spreadsheet` class.

**Before running:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
2.  **Create a dummy `goog\\spreadsheets.json` file:** This is for the `get_project_spreadsheets_dict` test.  Put a simple JSON structure in it.

```json
{
  "spreadsheets": []
}
```


Now you can run `pytest` in your terminal to execute the tests.  Remember to adjust the mocks and assertions as necessary to match the exact behavior of your `GSpreadsheet` class.
