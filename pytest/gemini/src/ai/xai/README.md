**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.raises` for exceptions:**  Added tests to check for `TypeError` when passing incorrect input to both `chat_completion` and `stream_chat_completion`.  This covers exception handling.  Crucially, the `test_xai_initialization` tests handle the case where an incorrect API key is provided.

* **`@pytest.fixture` for `xai_client`:** Creates a fixture to initialize the `XAI` client. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding potential state issues.  The example API key is replaced with a placeholder, you must replace this with your actual API key.

* **`TEST_MESSAGES` fixture:** A constant for the test messages, making the tests more readable and maintainable.

* **More comprehensive test cases:** Tests added for empty messages, ensuring the code handles empty input gracefully.  These tests use `pytest.raises` to catch exceptions as expected.

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_chat_completion_empty_messages`).

* **Important Considerations:**
    * **API Mocking:**  For robust streaming tests, you would need to mock the `requests` library or the xAI API to simulate the streaming response.  The basic streaming test checks for iterability.
    * **API Response Validation:** Without mocking or actual API interaction, the test `test_stream_chat_completion_valid_input` can only confirm that the response is iterable, not that the data is valid. The `test_chat_completion_response_keys` tests verify if the expected response keys exist. In a real scenario, you'd need to check the contents of the response.
    * **API Keys:** The example uses a placeholder `API_KEY`.  You **must replace** this with your actual API key **before running the tests**. Do not commit your API key to version control!


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_xai.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_xai.py`


Remember to install the `requests` library as specified in the original code, if you haven't already.  Also, ensure the `xai` library is in your Python path or correctly imported.
