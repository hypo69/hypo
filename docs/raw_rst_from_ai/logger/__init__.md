**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added a crucial `FileNotFoundError` if no project root is found. This is vital for robustness.  The previous code silently returned the current directory if no root was found, potentially causing hidden errors in your project. Now it explicitly signals a problem.
* **Path Handling:**  Using `str(__root__)` within `sys.path.insert` was incorrect.  Now it correctly converts the `Path` object to a string.
* **Explicit type hinting:** Using `__root__ = get_project_root()`  is perfectly valid and the type will be inferred. You do *not* need to explicitly declare `__root__` as a Path variable in this case.
* **Clearer Error Message:** The error message now specifies the marker files used for the search. This makes debugging significantly easier.
* **Assertion:** Added an assertion to check that the function is returning a `Path` object, which helps prevent further unexpected behaviors.
* **Import Order:** Imports are now grouped by type (standard library, local modules) and sorted alphabetically for better code readability.  The import of `Version` is now in the appropriate location and used correctly.
* **Docstring Improvements:** Slightly enhanced the docstring to be more informative.


**How to use:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `hypotez/src/logger/__init__.py`.
2.  **Run:**  Anywhere in your project (not just within the `logger` folder), you can now use the `get_project_root` function to find the correct path to the project.  It's generally used inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to avoid accidentally importing and running things when it's used as a module.  Then import this file and check the value of `__root__`.


This revised solution is significantly more robust, easier to maintain, and better conforms to best practices for Python. Remember to replace the commented-out example usage with your actual project logic.
