How to use the `cursor_spinner` module

This module provides a function to display a spinning cursor in your console, simulating a loading or waiting process.  It's useful for tasks that take a noticeable amount of time to complete and keeps the user informed.

**1. Installation (if applicable):**

This module is likely part of a larger project, so installation steps are not necessary if you have the `hypotez` package.


**2. Importing the `show_spinner` function**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.cursor_spinner import show_spinner
```

**3. Calling the `show_spinner` function**

The `show_spinner` function takes two optional arguments:

*   `duration`: The duration (in seconds) for which the spinner should be displayed.  Defaults to 5.0 seconds.
*   `delay`: The delay (in seconds) between each spinner character update. Defaults to 0.1 seconds.

```python
show_spinner(duration=3.0, delay=0.2)  # Displays a spinner for 3 seconds, with a 0.2-second delay.
```


**Example Usage (complete script):**

```python
from hypotez.src.utils.cursor_spinner import show_spinner

# ... other parts of your code ...

print("Starting a time-consuming task...")
show_spinner(duration=3.0)  # Display the spinner for 3 seconds
print("\nTask completed!")
# ... rest of your code ...
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `show_spinner` function utilizes a generator (`spinning_cursor`) to cycle through the characters "|", "/", "-", and "\\". This creates a smooth animation.
*   `sys.stdout.write` and `sys.stdout.flush` are essential for immediate output and preventing the spinner from being hidden by later output.
*   `time.sleep` introduces the specified delay between character changes.
*   `\b` (backspace) is used to overwrite the previous spinner character, creating the spinning effect.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Output Buffering:**  The `sys.stdout.flush()` call is crucial. Without it, the output might not appear immediately in some environments.  Without this, the spinner might not be visible until the end of the `show_spinner` function's execution.
*   **Console Compatibility:** This code is designed to work in various console environments. However, some environments might have different output handling that might affect the visual experience.


**Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):**

```python
try:
    show_spinner(duration=5.0)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nTask cancelled by user.")
```

This example shows how to handle a `KeyboardInterrupt` (e.g., user pressing Ctrl+C).

This usage guide covers the necessary information to effectively use the `cursor_spinner` module in your code for displaying a spinning cursor for a set amount of time. Remember to replace the placeholder code (`# ... other parts of your code ...`) with your specific application logic.
