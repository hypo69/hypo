How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a process for posting advertisements to Facebook groups. It uses a web driver to interact with the Facebook platform, specifically targeting "my groups." The script loads a list of group data from a JSON file (`my_managed_groups.json`), defines various campaign topics, and then continuously runs ad posting campaigns based on the loaded groups and topics.  It handles potential interruptions through a `try...except` block, logging an informational message if the process is stopped.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** Imports necessary modules, including a custom `Driver` class (likely for web browser automation), a `FacebookPromoter` class (for handling ad posting), and logging functionality.  Sets a `MODE` variable (likely for development or production environments).  Initializes a web driver (`d`) by opening a Chrome browser instance and navigating to facebook.com.


2. **Data Preparation:** Defines a list of filenames (`filenames`) containing data on the user's managed Facebook groups. Defines a list of campaign topics (`campaigns`) to target.


3. **Object Creation:** Creates an instance of `FacebookPromoter`, passing the driver and group file paths. Optionally, sets `no_video = True` to avoid potential video-related tasks.


4. **Campaign Execution:** Enters a `while True` loop, indicating continuous execution until manually stopped. Inside the loop:
   - It creates a copy of the `campaigns` list to prevent modification during the run (best practice).
   - Calls the `run_campaigns` method of the `FacebookPromoter` object to handle the execution of advertisement posting. The method is likely defined within the `FacebookPromoter` class, taking the campaigns and group file paths as inputs.
   -  The `...` represents code not included that likely handles the results of the posting and any necessary updates or delays.



5. **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` block. If the user interrupts the script execution (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), a log message "Campaign promotion interrupted." is generated.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # (Assuming necessary imports are already made)
    import copy
    import header  # Assuming this module is defined elsewhere
    from src.webdriver.driver import Driver, Chrome
    from src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.promoter import FacebookPromoter
    from src.logger import logger

    d = Driver(Chrome)
    d.get_url(r"https://facebook.com")

    filenames = ['my_managed_groups.json']
    campaigns = ['brands', 'mom_and_baby']

    promoter = FacebookPromoter(d, group_file_paths = filenames, no_video = True)

    try:
        while True:
            promoter.run_campaigns(campaigns = copy.copy(campaigns), group_file_paths = filenames)
            # ... (Add code to handle results and potential delays here)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Campaign promotion interrupted.")
