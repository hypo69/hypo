.. module: src.logger.exceptions
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: This module defines custom exceptions used in the application.

Program Exceptions
------------------

This module contains several custom exception classes to handle errors related to various application components, including file operations, product fields, KeePass database connections, and PrestaShop WebService errors.

Classes:
--------
- CustomException: The base custom exception class that handles logging.
- FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file is not found.
- ProductFieldException: Raised for errors related to product fields.
- KeePassException: Raised for errors related to KeePass database connections.
- DefaultSettingsException: Raised when there are issues with default settings.
- WebDriverException: Raised for errors related to WebDriver.
- ExecuteLocatorException: Raised for errors related to locator executors.
- PrestaShopException: Raised for generic PrestaShop WebService errors.
- PrestaShopAuthenticationError: Raised for authentication errors with PrestaShop WebServices.

# <algorithm>

1. **Import necessary modules:** The script imports modules for logging, Selenium WebDriver exceptions, and KeePass exceptions.

2. **Define base CustomException:**  This class handles logging of exceptions and stores the original exception if available.

3. **Define specific exception classes:** These classes inherit from `CustomException` or other relevant base classes, and specify conditions for their raising.

4. **PrestaShopException:** This class handles PrestaShop WebService errors with detailed attributes.

5. **PrestaShopAuthenticationError:** This is a specific error for authentication problems within the PrestaShop WebService context.

```

**Dependencies Analysis:**

The mermaid diagram shows the dependencies between the defined exception classes and imported modules.
- `src.logger` is imported, indicating a dependency on the `logger` module likely within the same project.
- `selenium.common.exceptions` and `pykeepass.exceptions` are imported, suggesting external libraries/packages, in this case, Selenium and pykeepass, are used for handling different types of exceptions.

# <explanation>

**Imports:**

- `from typing import Optional`: Imports the `Optional` type from the `typing` module, used for specifying optional parameters in function signatures. This is a standard Python type hint.
- `from src.logger import logger`: Imports the `logger` object, likely a logging instance from another module within the project (`src.logger`). This enables the custom exceptions to use the application's logging mechanism.
- `from selenium.common.exceptions import WebDriverException as WDriverException`: Imports the `WebDriverException` from the Selenium library. The `as WDriverException` creates an alias for the class to avoid naming conflicts.
- `from pykeepass.exceptions import ...`: Imports several exception types from the `pykeepass` library, covering various KeePass database interaction error scenarios.  This suggests the application interacts with a KeePass database.

**Classes:**

- `CustomException`: The base class for all application-specific exceptions. It handles logging, potentially using the `logger` instance, and allows for storing the original exception object.  It's important for centralized error handling and logging.
- `FileNotFoundError`: Inherits from `CustomException` and `IOError` to address file not found errors, providing more specific error handling.
- `ProductFieldException`, `KeePassException`, `DefaultSettingsException`, `WebDriverException`, `ExecuteLocatorException`, `PrestaShopException`, `PrestaShopAuthenticationError`: These are all custom exception classes tailored for specific error types within the application domain, providing contextual information.

**Functions:**

- `__init__` (in `CustomException` and `PrestaShopException`):  Constructor methods used to initialize exception instances with error messages and (optionally) original exceptions. The `PrestaShopException` constructor also takes additional error details like codes and messages from the PrestaShop WebService, which is a good practice for debugging.
- `handle_exception` (in `CustomException`): A method to handle the exception. It logs the exception details.  It should be noted that this method currently does not perform any recovery logic but is intended to be expanded.

**Variables:**

- `MODE`: A constant string, likely for configuration purposes (e.g., development/production mode).

**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

- The `handle_exception` method in `CustomException` is a stub.  Consider adding error recovery logic, retries, or alternative handling based on the expected error types.

- Adding specific error codes to the PrestaShopException can significantly aid in debugging issues in PrestaShop context.

- A dedicated error handling middleware layer could be more robust in managing exceptions in the future.


**Chain of Relationships:**

The code depends on `src.logger` for logging capabilities.  The application (not directly shown) likely interacts with Selenium for web automation, and it interacts with a KeePass database.
