**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Dummy `TinyPerson` Class:**  The original code lacked a `TinyPerson` class. This solution provides a dummy implementation for testing purposes.  Replace this with the actual `TinyPerson` class from your project if available.
* **`@pytest.fixture` for `agents`:** This fixture provides a consistent list of `TinyPerson` objects for all test methods using `agents`.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added tests for empty input lists and handling of cases where `agents` don't have the expected attributes (like `age` missing).
* **`ValueError` and `TypeError` Checks:**  The tests now use `pytest.raises` to assert that the functions raise the correct exceptions when given invalid input (empty lists, agents with missing data). This is critical for robustness.
* **`plt.get_fignums()` Check:**  This is crucial.  The test now verifies that a plot was generated.  This helps catch issues where plotting might silently fail, which is not always straightforward to detect.
* **`autouse` Fixture for Cleanup:** This crucial addition ensures that all plots generated during the tests are closed after each test run.  This prevents issues with multiple plots accumulating in the same session.
* **Clearer Test Descriptions:**  Test descriptions are more explicit about the conditions being tested.
* **`assert len(df)` checks:** Ensures the DataFrame has the expected number of rows.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_profiling.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_profiling.py` in your terminal.


This revised solution is much more comprehensive and robust in handling various potential errors and edge cases, making your tests much more effective. Remember to replace the dummy `TinyPerson` class with the actual one from your project. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest matplotlib pandas
```
