```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try...except` block to catch `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Crucially, it prints an informative error message.   Consider raising an exception, instead of silently ignoring errors in a production setting.  Handling errors is essential to prevent unexpected crashes and to provide helpful feedback to the user.

* **Encoding:** The `with open(...)` statement now includes `encoding='utf-8'`. This is vital for handling files that might contain non-ASCII characters, ensuring proper decoding.

* **Explicit return of current directory:** The function `get_project_root()` will now return the current directory in case no suitable root is found. This is a better way to handle cases where the markers are not present in the expected locations.

* **Clearer variable names:** The variable `__root__` is now assigned in the correct manner.

* **Docstrings:** Improved and more descriptive docstrings, especially for the `get_project_root()` function.


* **Readability and Style:** The code is formatted for better readability.


* **Missing keys handling:** The code now gracefully handles cases where keys like `project_name`, `version`, etc., might be missing in the `settings.json` file, preventing unexpected errors.

* **Documentation for attributes:** Added comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose and meaning of the variables `__root__`, `__project_name__`, etc. This helps maintain clarity and understanding of the script's purpose.

* **`if settings` Checks:** Added `if settings` checks to prevent errors when `settings` is `None` in the file


This revised version is more robust, readable, and better suited for production use. Remember to always handle potential errors and provide informative messages to the user when problems occur. This greatly increases the reliability of the code. Remember to add comprehensive error handling for production-level code.
