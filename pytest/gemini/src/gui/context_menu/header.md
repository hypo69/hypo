**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mock `settings.json`:** The `test_load_project_name_valid_settings` and `test_load_project_name_missing_project_name` now effectively mock the `settings.json` file using `unittest.mock.patch` to avoid reading and writing to the actual file, making the tests more robust.

2. **Mock `Path.cwd`:** The `test_get_root_path_valid_project_name` and `test_get_root_path_invalid_project_name` tests now mock `Path.cwd` to simulate different scenarios, making them more flexible.

3. **Comprehensive `test_append_bin_paths`:** The previous tests were incomplete. These test cases now verify that the code correctly handles both existing and non-existing paths in `sys.path`.

4. **Error Handling (`test_get_root_path_invalid_project_name`):**  Added a test to check for `IndexError` if the project name isn't found, ensuring robustness against invalid input.

5. **Clearer Test Function Names:** Names are more descriptive, improving readability.

6. **`__create_mock_file` Helper:** Created a helper function to simplify creating mock file objects for testing, improving code structure.

7. **`__MockFile` Class:**  The mock file class is a better approach to manage the mock `open()` functionality.


**Before running:**

* **`settings.json`:**  Create a `settings.json` file (if it doesn't exist) and populate it with sample data, or use the provided mock approach for testing.

* **`sys.path`:**  You may need to adjust the tests if the `bin` directories don't exist in the test environment. Consider adding appropriate mock data to `sys.path` within the test setup to simulate those cases.


This revised solution is more comprehensive, handles edge cases effectively, and uses mocking to isolate the tests from external dependencies, making them more reliable and maintainable. Remember to adapt the file paths (`settings.json`, project paths, etc.) to your specific setup. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
