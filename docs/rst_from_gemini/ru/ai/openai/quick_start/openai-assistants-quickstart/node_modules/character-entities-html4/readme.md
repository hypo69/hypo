# README for character-entities-html4

## Overview

This package provides a map of named character references from HTML 4.  It's primarily useful for projects dealing with parsing or manipulating HTML strings where you need to look up the character representation of a named entity.  For most general-purpose tasks, consider using `parse-entities` or `stringify-entities` for better utility.

## Installation

This package is ESM-only.

**Node.js (12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+)**

```bash
npm install character-entities-html4
```

**Deno**

```typescript
import { characterEntitiesHtml4 } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-html4@2?dts'
```

**Browsers**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { characterEntitiesHtml4 } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/character-entities-html4@2?min';
  console.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.AElig); // Accessing a character entity
</script>
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { characterEntitiesHtml4 } from 'character-entities-html4';

console.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.AElig); // Output: Æ
console.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.aelig); // Output: æ
console.log(characterEntitiesHtml4.amp); // Output: &
// Note: undefined if the entity isn't found.
```

## API

This package exports a single object: `characterEntitiesHtml4`.  This object is a map where keys are the named entities (e.g., "AElig") and values are the corresponding characters (e.g., "Æ").  All keys are case-sensitive.  Consult the HTML 4 specifications for a complete list of entities.

## Types

The package is fully typed using TypeScript.


## Compatibility

Supports all actively maintained Node.js versions (12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+).  Also compatible with Deno and modern browsers.

## Security
