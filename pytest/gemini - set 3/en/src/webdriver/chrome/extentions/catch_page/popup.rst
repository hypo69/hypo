**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Fixture:** The `driver` fixture now creates a temporary Chrome webdriver instance. This is essential because the JavaScript code relies on accessing the current tab's URL, which needs a real browser environment.  The `about:blank` URL is used for this example for simplicity.

2. **Explicit Waits:** `WebDriverWait` is used to handle potential delays and ensure elements are present before interacting with them.  This is critical to avoid `NoSuchElementException` errors.

3. **Alert Handling:** The tests now correctly handle the pop-up alerts.  The code acknowledges *both* alert boxes, verifying the content of each.

4. **Error Handling:** `try...except` blocks are used to catch potential `TimeoutException` errors and other exceptions that might arise from browser interactions.

5. **Simulating Failures:**  `test_send_url_failure` now includes a crucial step: *simulating* a failure response from `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.  Without this simulation, you cannot test the "Failed to send URL" path.  (The test now relies on you actually *expecting* a second alert).

6. **`test_no_button`:** This test verifies that the button exists. This is now essential since you are testing a real button.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium
    ```

2.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_popup.py`).

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest test_popup.py
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Mocking:** For a more robust solution in real-world scenarios, you might want to mock `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to simulate different responses (success/failure) and control the returned `response.status`. This would make your tests more flexible and independent of the actual browser actions.
* **Realistic URLs:** When testing, it might be useful to add functionality to navigate to a website with a known URL, or to simulate a URL to test different paths in your `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` handler.
* **Error Handling (In your extension code):**  Your `popup.js` code should have comprehensive error handling to catch and report failures correctly. It should not assume that the communication with the background script will always work as expected.


This improved solution significantly enhances the testability and robustness of the JavaScript code by incorporating a realistic browser environment and robust error handling. Remember to adapt the test cases to the specific expected behavior and error conditions of your `popup.js` code.
