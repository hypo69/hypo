## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/utils/string/__init__.py

This module provides utility functions for string manipulation, validation, and formatting within the `hypotez` project.  It's located in `hypotez/src/utils/string/__init__.py`.

**Key Classes:**

* **`StringFormatter`:**  This class likely provides methods for formatting strings.  Further details are needed.  To use it, you'll need to import it and instantiate an object.

    ```python
    from hypotez.src.utils.string import StringFormatter

    formatter = StringFormatter()
    # Example usage (requires specific method details):
    formatted_string = formatter.format_string(original_string, format_options)
    ```

* **`ProductFieldsValidator`:** This class is designed to validate string data related to product fields.  Use it to ensure data integrity.


    ```python
    from hypotez.src.utils.string import ProductFieldsValidator

    validator = ProductFieldsValidator()
    # Example usage (requires specific validation rules):
    is_valid = validator.validate_product_fields(product_data)
    ```

* **`StringNormalizer`:** This class likely provides methods for standardizing or normalizing strings.  This might involve things like converting to lowercase, removing extra whitespace, or handling different character encodings.

    ```python
    from hypotez.src.utils.string import StringNormalizer

    normalizer = StringNormalizer()
    # Example usage (requires specific normalization method details):
    normalized_string = normalizer.normalize_string(input_string)
    ```

**Module Variables (Important):**

* **`MODE`:** This variable is set to 'dev'. Its presence suggests that this is a development-related mode (e.g., potentially controlling logging or other behaviors).  Its exact implications depend on how this mode is implemented within other parts of your code.



**How to use this module:**


1. **Import the necessary classes:**  Import the class you need from the `hypotez.src.utils.string` module, as shown in the example usage blocks.

2. **Instantiate an object:** Create an object of the desired class.

3. **Call the appropriate methods:** Pass the necessary arguments to the method of your chosen class, and the method will perform the defined operation on the string data.


**Further Instructions Required:**

To provide more comprehensive usage instructions, please include:

* **Detailed documentation for each class (e.g., `StringFormatter`, `ProductFieldsValidator`, `StringNormalizer`)**:  Including their available methods, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.

* **Examples of valid input data and expected output for each class:** This is crucial for understanding the functionalities.
