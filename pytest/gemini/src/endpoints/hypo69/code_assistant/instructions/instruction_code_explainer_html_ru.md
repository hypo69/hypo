**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Placeholder Code:** The provided input code was just a prompt for writing tests, so I've added dummy functions (`add`, `subtract`, `divide`) to demonStarte the test structure.  **Crucially, replace these with the actual functions you want to test.**

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover a broader range of scenarios:
   - Positive numbers
   - Negative numbers
   - Zero
   - Mixed positive and negative numbers
   - Division by zero (using `pytest.raises` for exception handling)
   - Various combinations for the `divide` function

3. **Clear and Descriptive Test Names:** Test function names are informative, indicating the type of input and expected outcome.

4. **Proper Error Handling:** The `test_divide_by_zero` test uses `pytest.raises` to assert that a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised when dividing by zero, as specified in the prompt.

5. **Example Structure Followed:** The test code adheres to the example structure provided in the prompt, including docstrings for each test function.

6. **No Fixtures Needed:**  For the provided simple example functions, no fixtures are required, as the test functions have no external dependencies.  If your actual functions required data or setups, then fixtures would be necessary.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_functions.py`).
2. Run `pytest test_functions.py` from your terminal in the directory where you saved the file.

This revised answer provides a more complete and practical example of how to write `pytest` tests, considering the requirements outlined in the original prompt. Remember to replace the placeholder functions with the actual code you want to test.
