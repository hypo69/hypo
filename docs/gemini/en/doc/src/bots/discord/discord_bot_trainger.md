# Discord Bot Trainer

## Overview

This module provides a Discord bot for training and interacting with an AI model.  The bot handles commands for training the model with provided data (including file attachments), testing the model, archiving files, selecting datasets, displaying instructions, receiving feedback, and handling voice commands.

## Classes

### `Model`

**Description**:  This class represents the AI model.  It handles model training, prediction, and file management.

**Methods**:

- `train(data, data_dir, positive)`: Trains the model with the specified data.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `data` (str): Path to the training data file or directory.
        - `data_dir` (str, optional): Directory containing training data. Defaults to `None`.
        - `positive` (bool, optional): Flag indicating positive training data. Defaults to `True`.
    - **Returns**:
        - `str`: The job ID of the training task or `None` if the training fails.

- `predict(test_data)`: Makes predictions on the input data.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `test_data` (dict): The test data to predict on.
    - **Returns**:
        - `list|None`: A list of predictions or `None` if predictions fail.

- `archive_files(directory)`: Archives files in the specified directory.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `directory` (str): The directory to archive files from.
    - **Raises**:
        - `Exception`: Any exception encountered during archiving.

- `select_dataset_and_archive(path_to_dir_positive, positive)`: Selects and archives a dataset.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `path_to_dir_positive` (str): Path to the directory containing positive dataset files.
        - `positive` (bool): Indicates whether the dataset is positive (`True`) or negative (`False`).
    - **Returns**:
        - `str|None`: Path to the archived dataset, or `None` if selection failed.



- `save_job_id(job_id, description)`: Saves the job ID and a description of the task.  Presumably for logging or tracking purposes.


- `handle_errors(predictions, test_data)`: Handles errors that occur during prediction, potentially logging them.

## Functions

### `store_correction(original_text, correction)`

**Description**: Stores the correction for a previous response.

**Parameters**:
- `original_text` (str): The original response text.
- `correction` (str): The correction for the original response.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`:  Any exception that occurs during file write.

### `recognizer(audio_url, language='ru-RU')`


**Description**: This function is commented out, and appears to be a placeholder for speech-to-text functionality. It downloads an audio file, converts it to WAV, uses the `speech_recognition` library to transcribe the audio, and returns the recognized text.

**Parameters**:
- `audio_url` (str): URL of the audio file to recognize.
- `language` (str, optional): Language code for speech recognition. Defaults to 'ru-RU'.
- **Returns**:
    - `str`: Recognized text from the audio.
- **Raises**:
    - `sr.UnknownValueError`: If Google Speech Recognition cannot understand the audio.
    - `sr.RequestError`: If there's an issue requesting results from the speech recognition service.



### `text_to_speech_and_play(text, channel)`

**Description**: Converts text to speech and plays it in a specified voice channel.

**Parameters**:
    - `text` (str): The text to convert and play.
    - `channel` (discord.channel): The Discord voice channel where the audio should be played.



## Bot Events

### `on_ready()`

**Description**: Called when the bot is successfully connected to Discord.


### `on_message(message)`

**Description**: Handles incoming messages, responding to commands, and processing audio attachments.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `message` (discord.Message): The incoming message object.
    - **Raises**:
        - `Exception`: Any exception encountered during message processing.


## Commands

The bot responds to the following commands:

* `!hi`: Sends a greeting message.
* `!join`: Connects the bot to the user's voice channel.
* `!leave`: Disconnects the bot from the voice channel.
* `!train`: Trains the model with provided data.  Accepts file attachments as well as external files.
* `!test`: Tests the model with provided test data (JSON format).
* `!archive`: Archives files in a specified directory.
* `!select_dataset`: Selects a dataset for training.
* `!instruction`: Displays instructions from a file (bot_instruction.md).
* `!correct`: Allows correcting previous responses by message ID.
* `!feedback`: Provides feedback about model responses.
* `!getfile`: Attaches a file from a given path.

**Note:** Detailed documentation for each of these commands is available within the individual function definitions.
