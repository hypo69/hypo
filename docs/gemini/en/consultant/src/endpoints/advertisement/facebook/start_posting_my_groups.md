**Changes Made**

*   Added import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads_ns` for JSON handling.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads_ns` (or `j_loads`) where appropriate.
*   Added a `run_campaigns_loop` function to encapsulate the campaign running logic. This improves code structure and makes the code more manageable.
*   Used `logger.error` for error handling instead of generic `try-except` blocks, improving error logging and facilitating debugging.
*   Added a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to ensure the `run_campaigns_loop` function is only called when the script is run directly.
*   Added detailed comments and docstrings in reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   Improved error handling in the `run_campaigns_loop` function to catch and log exceptions with `exc_info=True`. This provides more debugging information.
*   Made `filenames` and `campaigns` into lists to better represent their intended usage and to be compatible with the `FacebookPromoter` class.
*   Added a `try...except` block inside the `run_campaigns_loop` function to handle potential errors during campaign execution. This is essential for robust code.
*   Removed the now unnecessary import of the `header` module.
*  Converted the `...` into a placeholder comment indicating the need for further logic. This is essential for providing context to the improvement steps.
