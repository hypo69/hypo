How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file, `main.py`, appears to be a configuration file or module for a FastAPI application related to Gemini.  It sets a variable `MODE` to 'dev'.  The repeated empty string docstrings and the platform specifiers indicate the file is meant for documentation or potentially to enforce consistent variable naming or module structure.  The comments also suggest the file is part of a larger project.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a variable named `MODE` and assigns the string value 'dev' to it.
2. The file contains multiple multiline string comments, likely intended for documentation purposes or to specify the intended platform(s) for the module.  These comments do not execute and don't affect the program's logic in this direct way.
3. The file's structure suggests a well-documented module with the primary function of defining a global variable.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No direct usage example provided due to the limited functionality of the code block itself.
    #To use this within a FastAPI application, you would likely import this module and access the MODE variable within your application's code.
    #Example of importing and using the 'MODE' variable:
    
    from hypotez.src.fast_api.gemini.backend.main import MODE
    
    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
