#Note:  If your logger classes handle specific exceptions in any way other than simply recording them,

#of exception with a particular response, or uses special attributes for these exceptions, you would need to 
#test that those behaviors are as expected.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Exception Tests:** The tests now include more comprehensive tests for the exception classes.  Crucially, they verify that the `__str__` method of the exceptions is correctly returning the expected message.  The previous tests were missing this vital aspect.
* **Specific Logger Tests:** The tests for the `logger` object now include basic checks for logging various levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR). This is essential for verifying that logging functions are working correctly.
* **Exception Handling Test:**  A new test `test_logger_custom_exception_handling` demonStartes how the logger might handle an exception. The critical part is that it now also calls `logger.exception` on the exception.
* **Important Note:** The provided logger module only *defines* the exception types. The actual functionality (e.g., whether logging occurs) is *not* tested here. This solution tests the exception classes for the expected strings, but doesn't test whether they're properly logged.  To test proper logging functionality you would need to have a logging mechanism in your `logger` module.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **Edge Case for Empty Exception Message:** The test `test_logger_no_exception_message` is added to demonStarte handling of situations where the exception object does not provide a message string.

**How to Use:**

1.  Save the tests in a Python file (e.g., `test_logger.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_logger.py`.


**Crucially:**  This solution is based on the assumption that the `logger` object in your `hypotez/src/logger/__init__.py` is handling logging correctly.  If it's just a placeholder, or if it's interacting with external logging mechanisms (e.g. a file or a console), you need to adjust the testing to validate the expected behavior of *that* interaction.  The tests for the `logger` function now accurately reflect what these tests are actually testing, which is only the ability of the logger to create the exception strings.
