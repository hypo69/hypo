```python
import pytest

# Tests for the __init__.py file (which currently only defines a constant)
def test_mode_value():
    """Checks if the MODE constant is correctly defined."""
    from hypotez.src.translators import MODE
    assert MODE == 'dev'

def test_mode_type():
    """Checks if the MODE constant has the expected type."""
    from hypotez.src.translators import MODE
    assert isinstance(MODE, str)

# Adding a test for a potential future function (if one exists).
#  This demonStartes how to test functions/classes that might be added later.
#  This test will fail if the module is modified and no such function exists.
def test_future_function_doesnt_exist():
    """Tests that a function (which might be added in future) doesn't exist yet."""
    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
        from hypotez.src.translators import some_future_function  # Replace with function name
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Specific Tests:** The tests now directly address the content of the provided `__init__.py` file, checking that the `MODE` constant is defined and has the correct value and type.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive (`test_mode_value`, `test_mode_type`).

3. **Import Handling:** The tests import the `MODE` variable from the correct module.

4. **Type Checking:** The `test_mode_type` function ensures that the variable is a string, as expected.

5. **Robustness (Future-Proofing):** The `test_future_function_doesnt_exist` test is added.  This is crucial for maintaining test suites as code evolves. It will raise an `AttributeError` if you attempt to access a non-existent function, which helps catch unintentional errors. Replace `some_future_function` with the actual function name when one is present.

6. **`pytest.raises` (if needed):**  The code now uses `pytest.raises` for exception testing, but since there's no code to raise exceptions, this is omitted in this case, but would be used if any exception handling were present in the source code under test.

7. **Fixtures (if needed):** No fixtures are needed for the `__init__.py` file, as it simply defines constants.  Fixtures would be used if data preparation or setup was required for a test.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the above test code in a file named `test_translators.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/translators/__init__.py` file.

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_translators.py
    ```


This improved solution covers the provided code thoroughly and demonStartes best practices for writing robust and maintainable test cases. Remember to adapt the test cases if the `hypotez/src/translators/__init__.py` file contains more complex logic.
