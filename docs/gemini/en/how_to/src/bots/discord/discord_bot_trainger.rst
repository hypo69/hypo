How to use the discord_bot_trainger.py code block
============================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code implements a Discord bot capable of various interactions, including joining and leaving voice channels, training a model, testing it with data, archiving files, selecting datasets, displaying instructions, receiving corrections, and handling user feedback. It also has functionalities for converting text to speech, and playing it in a voice channel. It uses the `discord.py`, `speech_recognition`, `pydub`, `gtts` libraries.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The script imports the necessary libraries, such as `discord.py`, `speech_recognition`, `pydub`, `gtts`, and others, for handling Discord interactions, audio processing, text-to-speech conversion, and more.
2. **Configure bot settings:** The `MODE`, `PREFIX`, and `intents` are defined to specify the bot's operational mode, command prefix, and desired Discord interactions, respectively.
3. **Create bot object:** An instance of the Discord bot (`bot`) is created using the `commands.Bot` class, specifying the command prefix and intents.
4. **Define Model object:** An instance of the `Model` class (likely from a separate module) is created to handle model training and prediction operations.
5. **`on_ready` event:** Defines what the bot should do when it successfully connects to Discord. In this case, it logs a message.
6. **Define bot commands:** A set of commands (`hi`, `join`, `leave`, `train`, `test`, `archive`, `select_dataset`, `instruction`, `correct`, `feedback`, `getfile`) are defined using decorators. These commands correspond to specific actions the bot will perform.
7. **`train` command:** This command handles model training. It accepts data input (potentially from a file attachment) and calls the `model.train` method to start the training process.
8. **`test` command:** This command facilitates testing the model with provided test data. It expects a JSON string as input, performs prediction, and handles errors during the prediction process.
9. **`archive` command:** This command archives files in a specified directory, likely used for dataset management.
10. **`select_dataset` command:** This command selects and archives a dataset for model training.
11. **`instruction` command:** Displays instructions from an external `.md` file.
12. **`correct` command:** Allows users to correct previous model responses. It logs the correction.
13. **`feedback` command:** Accepts feedback from users, logging it for improvement.
14. **`getfile` command:** Downloads a file from a given path and sends it to the user.
15. **`text_to_speech_and_play` function:** This function handles the conversion of text to speech using `gTTS`, saving the audio to a temporary file, and then playing the audio in the user's voice channel.
16. **`on_message` event:** This event handles incoming messages. It differentiates between command messages and general messages and calls the appropriate handling function based on the message content. It attempts speech recognition and handles user voice interaction.
17. **Run the bot:** The script starts the bot by calling `bot.run` with the Discord bot token.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example of how to use the 'train' command.
    # Assuming you have a file named 'training_data.json'.
    await bot.process_commands(ctx.message)  
    # Use the following command in Discord:
    #!train training_data.json


    # Example of how to use the 'test' command
    # Assuming you have valid test data in a JSON string named 'test_data'.
    #!test '{ "data": [{"input": "test_input", "output": "test_output"}] }'
