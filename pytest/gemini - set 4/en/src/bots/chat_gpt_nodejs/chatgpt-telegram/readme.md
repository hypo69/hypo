```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Functions:** The code now includes `add_numbers` and `divide_numbers` functions.  Crucially, it includes a `ZeroDivisionError` in `divide_numbers` to demonStarte exception handling.

2. **`pytest.raises`:**  The code correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for `ZeroDivisionError`.

3. **Clear Test Names:** Test names clearly describe the input and expected behavior.

4. **Fixtures:** A `test_data` fixture is created to hold various test cases, making the tests more organized and reusable.

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** The tests now cover cases with zero input and negative numbers,  crucially including an edge case where `divide_numbers` is called with zero as the denominator, triggering the expected `ZeroDivisionError`.

6. **Type checking and error handling** The code checks whether the expected result in `test_data` is an error or a number. This prevents unexpected errors and makes the tests more robust.



**To run these tests:**

1. Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_my_functions.py`).
2. Make sure you have pytest installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_my_functions.py
   ```

**Important Note:**  Replace the dummy functions with the actual functions from your code, and create tests specific to their logic and expected behavior. The provided structure serves as a template, and you need to adapt it based on the functions and classes in your actual Python code. Remember to thoroughly test input validation, error handling, and various possible scenarios. The article link does not provide any runnable code, so these are just example tests. You need to identify the functions/methods to test, their parameters, and expected outputs to write appropriate test cases.
