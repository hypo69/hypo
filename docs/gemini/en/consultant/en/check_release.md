**Received Code**



**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

*   Added missing `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` import.
*   Added type hints (`-> str | None`) to the function signature, specifying the function's return type.
*   Replaced `response.json()` with `j_loads(response.text)`, correctly handling JSON data.
*   Added `response.raise_for_status()` to check for bad HTTP responses (e.g., 404, 500) and raise exceptions if needed.
*   Introduced explicit `try...except` blocks to handle `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `KeyError`, logging errors using `logger.error` and returning `None` appropriately for improved error handling.  This prevents the script from crashing due to network issues or issues with the GitHub API.
*   Added RST documentation to the function, clearly defining parameters, return values, and potential exceptions. The documentation now complies with Sphinx requirements, and uses a more descriptive style.
*   Changed the module docstring from a single-line description to a more comprehensive multi-line description using reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   The TODO comment was removed and replaced with appropriate exception handling.
