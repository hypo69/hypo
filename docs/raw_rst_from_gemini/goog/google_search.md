**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`_clean` function improvement:** The most significant improvement is added a critical check for `None` and empty strings.  Now if `content` is `None` or empty, it immediately returns an empty string, preventing potential errors later in the code. This significantly improves robustness.
* **`get_data` Function Improvement:** The `get_data` function now returns an empty dictionary `{}` if no data is found, instead of `None`. This is a crucial change for handling cases where the parsed HTML does not contain the expected elements. This makes the function much safer to use in calling code.
* **Consistent naming:** Changed `StringNormalizerippet` to `snippet` for better readability and consistency within the code.
* **Docstring updates:**  Corrected and expanded docstrings for clarity and to address potential issues.   Added information about empty return handling.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:** The improved `_clean` and `get_data` functions prevent crashes and unexpected behavior in cases of missing or malformed data in the HTML source.
* **Maintainability:**  The code is more readable and easier to understand with consistent naming and improved docstrings.
* **Error Handling:** Explicitly handling cases where elements are missing or data isn't available is essential for writing production-quality code.

By incorporating these changes, the `GoogleHtmlParser` class is significantly more robust and reliable. Remember to test thoroughly with different types of input HTML to ensure the parser handles edge cases correctly.
