# How to use the hypotez/src/bots/telegram module

This module provides a Telegram bot framework.  This guide explains how to use the `TelegramBot` class.

**1. Introduction**

The `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/__init__.py` file is the entry point for the Telegram bot.  It primarily defines a global `MODE` variable (currently set to 'dev') and imports the `TelegramBot` class.

**2. Importing the TelegramBot**

```python
from .bot import TelegramBot
```

This line imports the `TelegramBot` class from the `bot.py` file within the `telegram` subdirectory.  You'll need to have a `bot.py` file present in the `hypotez/src/bots/telegram` directory for this to work.

**3. Using the TelegramBot (Example)**

```python
# Assuming you have a bot.py file with a TelegramBot class defined.
from .bot import TelegramBot

# Instantiate a TelegramBot object.  This likely requires some setup
# such as providing API token, etc.  The details would be documented within the
# bot.py file.
bot = TelegramBot(api_token='YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN')

# Call methods to interact with the bot.
# Examples (replace with your specific methods):
# bot.start_polling()  # Starts the bot polling for updates.
# bot.send_message(chat_id=12345, text='Hello!')
# bot.handle_update(update_object)  # Processes an update received from Telegram.

```

**Crucial Considerations**

* **`api_token`:** The `TelegramBot` constructor expects an `api_token`. You'll need to obtain this token from the Telegram Bot API settings.  **Important:** Do not hardcode sensitive information (like API keys) directly in your code.  Employ environment variables or configuration files to manage these secrets.


* **`bot.py`:** The `TelegramBot` class's implementation details, including how to initialize the bot, handle incoming messages, and define the bot's behavior are found within `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/bot.py`.  **Refer to this file's documentation** for how to use its methods and properties.


* **Error Handling:**  Add error handling to your code.  The `TelegramBot` class may raise exceptions during initialization or interaction with the Telegram API.  This will make your bot more robust.

* **Polling:** The example shows starting the bot with `bot.start_polling()`. This is a polling mechanism. Consider using a long-polling (or webhook) method for better performance, especially in production.

**4.  `MODE` Variable**

The `MODE = 'dev'` variable is likely used to indicate the current deployment mode.  If you need to execute different logic in production vs development, you would typically check this value.

```python
if MODE == 'dev':
    # code specific to development mode
else:
    # code specific to production mode
```

**5.  Further Development**

To use this module effectively, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.  Also, complete the implementation of the `TelegramBot` class within `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/bot.py` and provide thorough documentation about its methods and expected arguments.
