- `__version__`: This variable holds the version of the module or package.  In this case, "3.12.0.0.0.4".
- `__name__`: Contains the name of the module. If the script is being run directly, the value will be `"__main__"`.  This variable is declared but not assigned a value.
- `__doc__`: The module's documentation string. This variable is declared but not assigned a value.
- `__details__`: This variable likely contains additional details about the module, such as a description or history of changes.  In this case, "Details about version for module or class".
- `__annotations__`: Contains type annotations for variables and functions in the module.  This variable is declared but not assigned a value.
- `__author__`: The name(s) of the author(s) of the module.  In this case, "hypotez".

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Explicit Type Hinting:** Added explicit type hints (`__name__: str`, etc.) as per the docstring's suggestion.  This helps with static analysis.

* **Empty String for __doc__:** The docstring variable `__doc__` was left unassigned. This could cause problems if later the script tries to use the value without initializing it. The solution is to explicitly set it to an empty string (`""`).

* **Empty Dictionary for __annotations__:**  Similarly, `__annotations__` was left unassigned, causing a potential issue.  Empty dictionaries are appropriate when no type annotations are available.

* **Corrected Author:** The author's name in the code was ending with a space, which was likely a typo.  It's now corrected to `'hypotez'`.

* **PEP 8 Compliance:**  Minor formatting adjustments for better code readability.


These improvements make the code more robust, informative, and compliant with Python best practices. Remember to maintain a clear and accurate docstring to reflect the actual purpose and usage of the variables within the module.  The `__doc__` field is particularly important for documentation. The docstring now shows the value of the version and describes its purpose more completely.
