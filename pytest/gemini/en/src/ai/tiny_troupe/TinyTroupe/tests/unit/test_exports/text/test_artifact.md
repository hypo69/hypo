**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Function Names:**  Names like `test_process_text_valid_input` clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Input Validation:** Added tests for `empty_input` and `None` input. This is crucial to test robustness and prevent crashes.  Using `pytest.raises` is ideal for asserting exceptions.

3. **Edge Cases:** The tests now include cases with special characters and mixed-casing input, ensuring the function handles various types of input correctly.

4. **Example Usage (Crucial):** The hypothetical `process_text` function is now included.  **Replace this placeholder with your actual function from the file you are testing!**  This is essential for the tests to be relevant.

5. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover a wider range of possibilities, from valid strings to empty strings to `None` inputs, ensuring the function is tested thoroughly.

6. **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to the test functions to explain their purpose.  These are essential for maintainability and understanding the test's logic.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Save:** Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_artifact.py`).

2. **Install pytest:** If you don't have it already, install pytest:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

3. **Run the Tests:** Navigate to the directory containing `test_artifact.py` in your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pytest test_artifact.py
   ```

This will execute the tests and output the results.  If any test fails, it will indicate the problem, making debugging much easier. Remember to replace the placeholder `process_text` function with your actual code. Remember to save the file!
