```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:**  Crucially, I added `pytest.fixture`s to create temporary files (`settings.json`, `README.MD`) in a controlled way.  This avoids polluting the test environment and makes tests independent.


2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario.


3. **Mocking `gs`:**  I've added a placeholder `import dummy_gs`. You **must** replace `dummy_gs` with your actual `gs` module (or a mock of it) in your test environment for these tests to run properly.  This prevents hard dependencies on the actual `gs` module during testing.

4. **Error Handling:** Tests now explicitly check for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, as the original code handles exceptions gracefully.

5. **Edge Case:** Added a test (`test_set_project_root_no_marker_files`) to cover the case where no marker files are found in any directory.



**How to Use:**

1. **Replace `dummy_gs`:** Substitute the `import dummy_gs` line with the actual import of your `gs` module *or* implement a proper mock for the `gs` module in your test setup.


2. **Run Tests:** Execute `pytest` in your test directory.


3. **Install `pytest` and `packaging`:** If you don't have them already:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest packaging
   ```


This revised solution provides much more robust and comprehensive test coverage for your code, addressing potential issues and dependencies. Remember to adapt the `dummy_gs` import to match your actual `gs` module structure. Remember to replace the placeholder import statements with your actual code. Remember that you'll need to install the `packaging` library (`pip install packaging`).
