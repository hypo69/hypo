**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints for `get_project_root` function and variables.
- Replaced `json.load` with `src.utils.jjson.j_loads` as instructed.
- Added `try...except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to handle potential issues during file loading, and a specific `ModuleNotFoundError` for `src.utils.jjson`.  Improved error handling by printing informative messages to the console.
- Corrected `copyright` spelling.
- Improved code formatting for better readability.
- Improved variable naming (e.g., `current_path` to `project_root`).
- Added more descriptive comments.
- Converted `__root__` to a `Path` type.
- Using `.read_text()` for file reading which is more appropriate for text files.
- Fixed variable names and added types for all relevant variables to match the code style.


This improved code is more robust, handles potential errors, and is more consistent with Python best practices.  The use of `try-except` blocks is crucial for preventing unexpected crashes when loading external data.  The `ModuleNotFoundError` is added to handle cases when `src.utils.jjson` isn't found, crucial for preventing unexpected errors during runtime.  Added type hints are also beneficial for code understanding and maintainability. Remember to install the `src.utils.jjson` module if it is not already present.
