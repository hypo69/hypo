**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing `Graber` Class:** The provided `ivory` module only imports the `Graber` class but doesn't define it.  The example tests are commented out, and you'll need to uncomment and adapt them *dramatically* to the actual `Graber` class's definition (methods, arguments, return types).  Add the actual Python code for `Graber` to `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/__init__.py` for complete testing.

2. **Mocking (`mocker`):** If `Graber` interacts with external resources (e.g., a database, network API), you *must* use `mocker.MagicMock` or similar mocking techniques within the `pytest` fixture and in the tests to isolate your tests from those external dependencies.  The example fixture shows how you might mock the Graber class if it's used in a test case.

3. **`pytest.raises`:** The example includes a test to check for a `ValueError` if there's an invalid input; adjust it to the exception type that your Graber function would raise if it gets invalid or unexpected input.

4. **Parametrization (`@pytest.mark.parametrize`):** Using parametrization in the example tests lets you run the same test with multiple inputs efficiently.

5. **Specific Tests:** Replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with tests specific to the methods and logic within your `Graber` class.  Examine the `Graber` class (which you haven't shown), determine how its methods work, and write tests to verify that these methods work as expected with valid input, invalid input (handling exceptions), edge cases (boundary values or data structures), and other relevant scenarios.

6. **Meaningful Assertions:**  The example tests include basic assertions (e.g., `assert isinstance(result, list)`).  Add more detailed assertions based on the actual expected structure, type, and contents of the return values of your functions and methods.

7. **Thorough Testing:**  Tests should cover all significant aspects of your code. Think about edge cases, boundary conditions, error handling, and various scenarios of usage.


By filling in the missing `Graber` code and adapting the tests according to its structure, you will create a robust test suite. Remember to refer to the actual implementation details for writing precise and complete tests.
