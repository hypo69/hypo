How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project.  It searches upwards from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`).  It then initializes a variable `__root__` with this path and adds it to the Python path (`sys.path`).  Subsequently, it loads settings from a `settings.json` file located within the project's root directory and optionally a README.md document.  Finally, it defines several project-related variables (name, version, documentation, etc.) based on the loaded data or defaults.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from the `packaging` library, and `Path` from the `pathlib` module.

2. **Define the `set_project_root` function:** This function takes an optional argument `marker_files` to customize the search for the project root.

3. **Determine the project root:** It starts from the current file's directory and traverses up the directory tree.  For each parent directory, it checks if any of the marker files specified in `marker_files` exist within that directory.  If found, it sets `__root__` to that directory and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Add root to sys.path:** If the root directory is not already in `sys.path`, it adds it to the beginning of the path.

5. **Return the project root:** The function returns the `__root__` path.

6. **Get the project root:** The `__root__ = set_project_root()` line calls the function to get the project root.

7. **Import `gs` module:** The code imports the `gs` module from within the project's source code (`src`).

8. **Load settings:** It attempts to load JSON settings from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json'`.  If the file isn't found or the JSON is invalid, it handles the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` gracefully and sets `settings` to `None`

9. **Load documentation (optional):** It attempts to read the content of a README file located at `gs.path.root / 'src' /  'README.MD'`. If the file isn't found, it handles the `FileNotFoundError` and sets `doc_str` to `None`.

10. **Define project variables:** It defines several project variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__coffee__`) based on the loaded `settings` or predefined default values.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example assuming you have a 'pyproject.toml' and 'settings.json'
    # in the project root directory
    from hypotez.src.logger.header import set_project_root

    # Call the function to get the project root
    root_path = set_project_root()

    # Now you can use the root_path to access files in your project
    print(root_path)

    # Example of accessing settings.json data
    from pathlib import Path
    settings_file_path = Path(root_path, 'src', 'settings.json')
    try:
        with open(settings_file_path, 'r') as file:
            settings_data = json.load(file)
            print(settings_data["project_name"])
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("settings.json not found")
