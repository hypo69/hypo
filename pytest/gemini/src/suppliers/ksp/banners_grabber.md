**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`test_get_banners_valid_input`:**  This test verifies the basic functionality.  Crucially, it now *asserts* that the function returns `True`.  This is the expected behavior based on the provided code.

2. **`test_get_banners_no_input`:**  Since the function doesn't take any arguments, this test checks that it behaves correctly when no input is provided.

3. **Removed Unnecessary Tests:** The original code had test cases for invalid/edge cases but lacked specific examples of what those cases were. Without clear examples of what constitutes "invalid input" or "edge cases" in the function, those tests were removed. If you have more details about what the function might accept, specific invalid/edge cases can be added.  The function in this case is extremely basic and doesn't seem to take input at all, so there's nothing to test as invalid input.


**Important Considerations (and Why these Tests Are Sufficient):**

* **The Nature of `get_banners`:** The `get_banners` function simply returns `True`.  There's no logic involving input processing or error handling.  Therefore, the test cases only need to check that the function does what it's supposed to do as simply as possible.
* **Missing Context:** Without understanding the *intended* behavior of `get_banners` within the larger application, it's impossible to create more sophisticated tests. For instance, if the function is meant to fetch banners from an external source (API, file, etc.), then more extensive tests would be needed to mock those external calls and verify the output.

**How to proceed if the function is more complex:**

If the `get_banners` function were to:

* **Take arguments:**  Add test cases that cover different argument types, valid and invalid values, and edge cases for those arguments.
* **Make external calls:** Mock those calls with `pytest.monkeypatch` to test the function's behavior without actually making network requests.
* **Raise exceptions:** Use `pytest.raises` to assert that specific exceptions are raised when appropriate inputs are provided.

Remember to update the tests as needed to match the *actual* behavior of your function.  If the return value is meant to be something else, or if the function accepts input, the tests should reflect that.


**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (as `test_banners_grabber.py`) in the same directory as the Python file you want to test (`banners_grabber.py`).
3.  Run the tests from the command line: `pytest`
