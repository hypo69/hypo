**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now accurately reflect the test's purpose, making them easier to understand.

2. **Error Handling:** `test_root_path_calculation` now correctly handles the case where "hypotez" doesn't exist, raising a `ValueError` as expected.  It also includes a clean up step to remove the test directory.

3. **Edge Cases:** `test_root_path_calculation` and `test_no_hypotez_path` specifically address the scenario where "hypotez" is not part of the current path.  `test_empty_string_path` demonstrates a crucial case with empty string.

4. **Robustness:** The tests now clean up the test environment (removing the created directory) after each test, preventing issues in subsequent tests.

5. **`pytest.raises`:**  Added `pytest.raises` for testing exception handling with empty string input.

6. **Explicit Path:** The code uses `os.path.join` to build paths correctly. This helps avoid issues with different operating system separators.

7. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:**  Since the functions do not rely on external data, no fixtures are needed.

8. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests cover different scenarios including valid inputs, and critical cases where the 'hypotez' directory might not exist.



This significantly improved solution addresses all the requirements and produces robust, reliable tests for the given code. Remember to run `pytest` from the directory containing these test functions. Remember to install pytest: `pip install pytest` if you haven't already. Remember to adapt the test directory structure to reflect the project's layout. Remember to run `pytest` from the directory containing the test file.
