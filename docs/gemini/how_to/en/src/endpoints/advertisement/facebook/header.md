# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/header.py`

This file sets up the environment and gathers metadata about the project, particularly useful for internal tools and documentation.  It defines crucial variables like the project root, name, version, and more.

## Key Concepts

* **`set_project_root()`:** This function is the core of the initialization. It locates the project's root directory by searching upwards from the current file's location.  Crucially, it adds the project root to Python's `sys.path`, enabling import of modules in subdirectories.

* **Project Metadata:** The script reads metadata like project name, version, author, and copyright from a `settings.json` file located in the project root. This allows you to centralize configuration data.  A fallback value (e.g., 'hypotez') is provided for each variable in case `settings.json` is missing or invalid.

* **Error Handling:**  The script uses `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential issues, such as the `settings.json` file being missing or containing invalid JSON.  This prevents the script from crashing.


## How to Use

This file is typically imported and used by other files within the project. You don't directly interact with it.  Instead, its functionality is leveraged by other modules.


### Example Usage (Illustrative):

```python
# In another file (e.g., a main script):
import sys
import os
from hypotez.src.endpoints.advertisement.facebook.header import __root__, __version__

# Access project-specific information
print(f"Project Root: {__root__}")  # Output the path to the project root.
print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")  # Access the project version


# Example accessing metadata in a function:
def my_function():
   # ...some code...
   print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}") #Accessing the project name

my_function()
```

### Critical Considerations:

* **`settings.json`:** Ensure that the `settings.json` file exists in the project root directory and contains valid JSON with the required keys (e.g., `"project_name"`, `"version"`).

* **`requirements.txt`:**  The script relies on `requirements.txt` to identify the project root.  Make sure this file exists and contains dependencies.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are essential.  They prevent your application from breaking if these files are missing or corrupted.


### Troubleshooting:

If the project root cannot be found, the `set_project_root()` function will return the path to the current file's directory. Review your directory structure and file paths to confirm the project root is correctly defined. Verify that the `settings.json` file is correctly configured. Check the `.git` or `pyproject.toml` directories.
