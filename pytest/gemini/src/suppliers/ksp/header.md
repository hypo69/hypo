```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** The tests now cover cases where the marker file is in different locations (current, parent, and grandparent directories), addressing edge and boundary cases. This is crucial for robust functionality.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names clearly describe the test scenario.
* **Dummy File Creation and Removal:** The tests now create temporary dummy files (`pyproject.toml`) to simulate specific conditions, and they are carefully removed to avoid impacting other tests.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The tests do not need `pytest.raises` since the original code doesn't explicitly raise exceptions that are caught by `try...except`. This is not a failure but a more realistic scenario for the code as it currently exists.
* **Parametrization:** The `test_set_project_root_nonexistent_file` function now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with multiple marker files, significantly improving the test suite's coverage. Added `DS_Store` as an example of a common edge case.


**Crucial Considerations for Additional Tests (in a separate file):**

To fully test the loading of `settings` and `doc_str`, you need a separate test file containing data for `settings.json` and `README.MD` files to use for testing these operations.  These tests should:

1.  **Create `settings.json` and `README.MD`:**  Mocks should be created during the tests, which is typically done by creating these files in a temporary directory.
2.  **Test Valid JSON:** Verify that `json.load()` works correctly with various valid JSON structures.
3.  **Test `FileNotFoundError`:** Create situations where `settings.json` or `README.MD` do not exist.
4.  **Test `json.JSONDecodeError`:** Create `settings.json` files with invalid JSON to ensure that the `except` block correctly handles that.

This separation of concerns enhances testing maintainability and clarity.  Remember to clean up the files generated by these tests after their execution.
