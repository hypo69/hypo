```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Added necessary imports for `pytest`, `unittest.mock` and the driver class.  Crucially, the code now includes the path correction (`sys.path.append(...)`) to find the `driver.py` file.  This assumes your `driver.py` is in a `src/webdriver` folder relative to the test file. Adjust if necessary.


2. **Mocking:** The tests now effectively mock the `execute_script` method using `unittest.mock.patch`. This is crucial because the tests don't need to actually interact with a real browser or webdriver instance.  This is more robust than simply asserting the call was made.


3. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names are now more descriptive and clearly indicate the test case.


4. **Exception Handling:** Added tests to verify correct exception handling for various invalid inputs. This is important to cover the code's robustness.


5. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for edge cases (like non-numeric values in `scroll`) to ensure the code handles these situations properly.



**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as `test_driver.py` in a `tests` directory next to your `src/webdriver` directory.
2.  Run `pytest tests/test_driver.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:** The path to `driver.py` (in `sys.path.append`) must match your project structure.
*   **Realistic Data:**  For better testing, replace the hardcoded example inputs with data retrieved from a database or generated through a factory method for more realistic test scenarios.
*   **Dependencies:** If your `driver.py` has dependencies, make sure they are installed and available in your test environment.  Consider using `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock` for testing with mocks.


This improved solution is more robust and comprehensive, thoroughly testing the `DriverBase` class without relying on an actual browser instance. Remember to adapt it to your specific project structure and dependencies.
