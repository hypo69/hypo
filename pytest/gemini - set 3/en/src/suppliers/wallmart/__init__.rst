**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:** The code now correctly imports the `pytest` library.
2. **Example Fixture:** A simple `example_data` fixture is provided.  You'll need to replace this with appropriate data for your `Graber` class.
3. **`test_get_product_info_valid_input`:**  The test now checks if the returned value is a dictionary and if a specific key ('name') exists in the dictionary. This shows how to verify more specific aspects of the return data.
4. **`test_get_product_info_invalid_url`:** This test demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for the correct exception (ValueError) and a relevant error message.
5. **`test_get_product_info_empty_url`:** Added a test for an empty URL, which is an important edge case.
6. **`test_graber_exception_handling`:** Shows how to test for exceptions that might be raised *inside* the `Graber` class during its internal operations. This is crucial for robust testing. It uses a mock to simulate the internal function.
7. **Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the purpose of each test function.
8. **Placeholders:**  Important placeholders (`# Replace with...`) have been left for you to complete based on your actual `Graber` class's implementation and expected outputs.

**Before running these tests:**

- Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
- Replace `"https://www.walmart.com/products/product-1234"` with actual URLs from Walmart or a mock URL.
- Replace the placeholder `example_data` with appropriate values.
- Ensure that the `Graber` class (or its methods) raises the correct exceptions for invalid inputs.
- Replace the assertions in the tests with your expected results for each test case.

This improved example gives a more complete and robust set of test cases, addressing potential errors, edge cases, and exception handling within your `Graber` class. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific functionality and expected outputs of your `Graber` class. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual expectations.
