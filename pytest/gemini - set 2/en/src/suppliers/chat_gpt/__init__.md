# Example test if there's a __init__ with specific parameters


# If other functions or classes are present in the file,
# add tests to cover those as well.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the purpose, like `test_gpt_gs_mode`, which helps in understanding the test's objective.

2. **Fixture for `GptGs`:** A `gpt_gs_instance` fixture is created to provide a `GptGs` object for each test. This isolates the tests.

3. **Mode Test:** A `test_gpt_gs_mode` is added to verify the `MODE` variable's value.

4. **Instance Creation Test:**  A `test_gpt_gs_instance_creation` test ensures the `GptGs` instance is created successfully.

5. **Example Tests for Methods (Placeholder):** Placeholder tests are included for `fetch_data` (if it exists). These examples demonStarte how to use `pytest.raises` for exception handling, which is crucial.

6. **Error Handling:** Placeholder error handling examples using `pytest.raises` are now available, showing the best way to verify that expected exceptions are raised for invalid input.

7. **Missing Imports:**  Import statements are essential and have been added, especially if `fetch_data` needs to import from external modules.

**Crucial Next Steps (to make the tests functional):**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The code now includes placeholder tests for `fetch_data`.  You absolutely **must replace these placeholders** with the actual code from the `GptGs` class, including how `fetch_data` interacts with Google Sheets (e.g., using a mock).  Ensure the tests cover valid, invalid, and edge cases for any methods you want to test.
* **Mock `google_sheets`:** If your `GptGs` code relies on the `google_sheets` module, you'll need a way to mock it.  Use `unittest.mock.patch` or similar to simulate the behavior of that module's `fetch_data` or similar calls within your tests.
* **Define Inputs & Expected Outputs:**  You should define the inputs you expect to give to `fetch_data` (e.g., the sheet name) and the corresponding expected outputs (e.g., a list of dictionaries). Then, assert that the outputs from your test match these expectations.

By following these steps, your test suite will become fully functional and comprehensive.  Remember to adapt the test cases to the actual methods and structures of the `GptGs` class in your code. Remember to install the necessary libraries (e.g., for Google Sheets API).
