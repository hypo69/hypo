This Python script (`hypotez/src/webdriver/playwright/header.py`) sets up project-level variables and paths.  Here's a usage guide:

**Purpose:**

The script aims to find the project root directory and load project settings from a `settings.json` file and documentation from `README.md`. It then populates several variables with these settings for use throughout the project. Importantly, it adds the project root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`).

**How to use it:**

1. **Project Structure:**

   Ensure your project has a structure like this:

   ```
   hypotez/
     src/
       settings.json
       README.MD
       ... (other files/directories)
       gs/  (likely a submodule with a path object or similar)
         path.py   # Contains gs.path
       ...
   ```

   Crucially, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git` (or similar) need to exist somewhere in the directory tree *above* the `hypotez/src/` directory, to indicate the project root, or it won't work correctly.


2. **`gs.path` Module:**

   The script assumes you have a `gs` module (likely containing a `path` submodule) with a `Path`-like object that correctly represents paths within the project, relative to the `__root__` variable.  This is essential for correctly referencing files within the project structure.  **You need to implement or adapt the `gs.path` module** to work with your directory structure if this is not already in place.  The script will break without a working `gs.path` module.

3. **`settings.json`:**

   This file should contain project-specific settings as a JSON object, ideally like this:

   ```json
   {
     "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
     "version": "1.2.3",
     "author": "Your Name",
     "copyright": "Copyright 2023",
     "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
   }
   ```

4. **`README.MD`:**

   Place project documentation in this file in Markdown format.

5. **Import and Use:**

   Import the variables defined in this file in other parts of your project.  These variables are:

   * `__root__`: Path to the project root.
   * `__project_name__`: Project name (from `settings.json` or default).
   * `__version__`: Project version (from `settings.json` or default).
   * `__doc__`: Project documentation (from `README.MD` or default).
   * `__details__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__cofee__`: Additional project metadata.

   Example:

   ```python
   from hypotez.src.webdriver.playwright.header import __project_name__

   print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
   ```

**Explanation of Key Parts:**

* **`set_project_root()`:**  This function is crucial. It traverses up the directory tree until it finds a directory containing `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`.  *This is a common pattern to find the project root in Python projects.*  The `marker_files` argument allows customization for different projects. Adding more marker files will make it more reliable.
* **`sys.path.insert(0, str(__root__))`:**  Adds the project root to the beginning of the Python module search path, allowing you to import modules from the `src` directory (e.g., `from src import gs`).
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks gracefully handle cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` might be missing or improperly formatted.

**Critical Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The script's error handling is quite basic.  Consider adding more specific error messages or logging to make debugging easier.
* **`gs.path`:** This function relies heavily on the existence of the `gs` module and a `gs.path` object with methods similar to `pathlib.Path`.  **Ensure this is correctly implemented!**
* **Dependencies:** The `packaging.version` module is a dependency; ensure it's installed (`pip install packaging`).


By following these steps, you can effectively use this header file to standardize project setup and access project-wide information.  Remember that using `__root__` as a global variable is common but not the best practice in larger projects, so consider refactoring for better code organization.
