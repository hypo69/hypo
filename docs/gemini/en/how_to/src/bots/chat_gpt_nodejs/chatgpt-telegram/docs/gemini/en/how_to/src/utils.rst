How to use the `removeFile` function
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines an asynchronous function `removeFile` that deletes a file specified by its path.  It handles potential errors during the file removal process by logging the error message to the console.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import the `unlink` function:** The code imports the `unlink` function from the `fs/promises` module, which is used for asynchronously removing files.

2. **Define the `removeFile` function:** This function takes a single argument `path`, which represents the absolute path to the file to be deleted.

3. **Attempt file removal:**  The `unlink(path)` function call attempts to delete the file.  The `await` keyword ensures this operation is performed asynchronously.

4. **Error handling:** A `try...catch` block surrounds the `unlink` operation.  If any error occurs during the file removal (e.g., the file doesn't exist, insufficient permissions), the `catch` block will execute.

5. **Logging the error:** Inside the `catch` block, an error message including the error's message is logged to the console.  This helps with debugging and tracking issues.

6. **Return:** The function silently returns from the `try` or `catch` block.  This implies the function will complete regardless of success or failure of file removal.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: javascript
    
    import { removeFile } from './utils.js';

    async function example() {
        const filePath = './myFile.txt';
        // Create a dummy file first (optional for testing)
        const fs = require('fs');
        fs.writeFileSync(filePath, "This is a test file.");

        await removeFile(filePath);
        console.log('File removal complete.');
        //Optional: Check if the file exists after removal
        try{
          fs.accessSync(filePath);
          console.log("File still exists!")
        } catch (err){
          console.log('File successfully removed.')
        }
    }
