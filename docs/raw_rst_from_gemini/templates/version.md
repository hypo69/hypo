**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is the `try...except` block.  This now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.  Critically, it prints an informative error message to the console. This is *vital* in a production environment.  Without this, if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, your script would silently fail, which is much harder to debug.  Also, consider using a logging library (e.g., `logging`) instead of `print` for error messages in a production setting.

* **Type Hinting:**  The `settings: dict = None` is a good practice. However, it's beneficial to add type hints throughout the code if you are using a static type checker.  This could be useful when developing with a linting/debugging tool.

* **Corrected Variable Name:**  The `__copyrihgnt__` variable was misspelled; it's corrected to `__copyright__`.

* **Validation:** The most significant change is the validation of `__version__`. The code now explicitly checks if `__version__` is empty or `None`.  If it is, a `ValueError` is raised. This is critical, because if the version isn't available, your downstream code that depends on the version information won't work correctly.


**How to use:**

1.  **`settings.json`:** Create a `settings.json` file in the same directory as `version.py` (i.e., `../settings.json`) with the following structure (or similar):

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024 Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

2.  **Run the code:**  Make sure your Python interpreter is configured with the correct `venv`.   If you run this code without `settings.json` or with a malformed `settings.json`, it will print an informative error message.

This revised `version.py` is now significantly more robust and usable in a production environment, as it provides useful feedback when something goes wrong.  The improved error handling makes it much easier to quickly troubleshoot problems when your script fails.  It's best practice to log errors in a production environment instead of printing to the console.
