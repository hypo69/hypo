```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.endpoints.kazarinov.pricelist_generator import ReportGenerator

# Fixture definitions (if needed)
# No fixtures are needed for this simple example.


# Tests for ReportGenerator class
def test_report_generator_valid_input():
    """Checks correct instantiation with valid input."""
    generator = ReportGenerator()
    assert isinstance(generator, ReportGenerator)  # Verify object creation


def test_report_generator_invalid_mode():
    """Checks exception handling for invalid mode."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        ReportGenerator(mode="invalid")  # Expect ValueError for invalid mode


def test_report_generator_empty_data():
    """Checks behavior with empty data input."""
    generator = ReportGenerator()  # Use default mode
    # The ReportGenerator class may not require data input in this example.
    # Replace with actual test if data is expected.
    assert generator  #Check if object initialization succeeds even with empty data
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:**  Import `ReportGenerator` correctly from the specified module path.

2. **Fixtures:**  No fixtures are needed for the provided code snippet as it only contains a class definition.

3. **`test_report_generator_valid_input`:**  This test verifies that the `ReportGenerator` class can be instantiated successfully.


4. **`test_report_generator_invalid_mode`:** This test checks for exception handling when an invalid `mode` is passed during instantiation.  It's crucial to test exception handling for robustness.  Crucially, it uses `pytest.raises` to assert the expected exception type.

5. **`test_report_generator_empty_data`:** This test case is essential. It attempts to use the `ReportGenerator` with empty data.  Because there is no clear input data passed to the constructor, I have kept this test as a check for the successful creation of the object even with no data being passed.  It would need modification if you had input data to check against the expected functionality in the class.  (If the class has methods to process data, those methods should also be tested).


**Important Considerations for More Comprehensive Testing:**

* **Missing `__init__` parameters:**  If `ReportGenerator` has parameters in its constructor that accept input data, you'll need test cases for various valid and invalid data formats (e.g., different data types, empty data, incorrect data structures).


* **Method testing:**  If `ReportGenerator` has methods (e.g., `generate_report`), you must add test cases to verify those methods.  This would include testing various input scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases) for these methods, as well as checking the output produced.


* **Output validation:**  For methods that return data, make sure to validate the returned data's format, type, and content.  What output are you expecting from the class (e.g., a generated report file, a dictionary)?



**Example with Data:**

If the `ReportGenerator` class had an `__init__` method accepting data:

```python
def test_report_generator_valid_data():
    data = {"key1": "value1"}  # Example data
    generator = ReportGenerator(data=data)
    assert generator.data == data  # Check if data is correctly stored. 
```


These improvements make the tests more comprehensive and robust. Remember to adapt these tests based on the actual implementation details of your `ReportGenerator` class.  You need more information on the expected inputs, outputs, and functionality to write accurate and valuable tests.
