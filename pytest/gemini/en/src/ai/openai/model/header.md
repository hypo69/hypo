**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`temp_project_root` Fixture:** This fixture creates a temporary directory with the required marker files, enabling reliable and isolated tests without affecting the real file system.  Critically, it's now set up to test the *directory* aspect properly.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover a wider range of scenarios, including cases where marker files are missing, no marker files are provided, and the current directory is the root.  Crucially, it addresses edge cases where the root directory isn't found, which was a major problem in the original attempt.

3. **Error Handling:** A test `test_set_project_root_no_root_found` is added to check for the case where the marker files are not found. It uses `monkeypatch` to mock `__file__` to simulate a scenario where the marker files are not in the expected location.  This dramatically improves robustness.

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are now more specific and readable, making it easier to understand the expected behavior of the function.

5. **Correctness of Root Finding:**  The `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` test checks if the function correctly defaults to the directory where the script is located if no marker files are found.  This checks the return value, not just the presence of a directory.

6. **Type Handling:** A `test_set_project_root_invalid_marker_file_type` demonstrates proper error handling for unexpected input types, adhering to best practices.



**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_header.py`

This improved test suite is much more comprehensive and reliable for verifying the correctness and robustness of the `set_project_root` function. Remember to adjust the test data and assertions according to the specific expected behavior of your function. Importantly, use `pytest`'s fixture capabilities whenever possible for better organization and isolation of tests.
