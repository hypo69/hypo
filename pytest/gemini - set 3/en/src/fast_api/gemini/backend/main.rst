**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code `hypotez/src/fast_api/gemini/backend/main.py` is empty.  There are no functions or classes to test.  Therefore, no meaningful test cases can be generated.

**To create tests, you need to:**

1. **Provide the actual Python code:**  The code you want to test must be present in the `input_code` section.  This code defines the functions, classes, and logic you want to verify.

2. **Identify functions/classes to test:**  List out the functions and/or classes that you want to test.

3. **Define test scenarios:**  Determine the different types of input data you'll use to test each function (valid, invalid, boundary cases, edge cases).  Anticipate possible errors or exceptions.

4. **Determine expected outputs:** For each test scenario, determine the expected output.

5. **Write `pytest` test functions:**  These functions will call the functions/methods you're testing with different inputs and then assert that the outputs match the expected results.

6. **Use `pytest.raises`:** Use `pytest.raises` to verify that specific exceptions are raised when invalid input or other error conditions occur.

7. **Define fixtures (if needed):** If your test functions require complex or repetitive data setup, create fixtures to manage this data.

Once you provide the actual code, I can generate appropriate and comprehensive test cases using the provided structure. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with specific details for your code. Also, make sure you run `pytest` from your terminal to execute the tests.
