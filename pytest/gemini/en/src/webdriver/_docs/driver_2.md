**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `pytest.fixture` and `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `selenium.webdriver` objects. This is crucial for avoiding real browser interactions during testing.  The `mock_webdriver` fixture now directly mocks the `selenium.webdriver` object.  This is a much safer and more practical approach for WebDriver testing, especially in pytest.

2. **Clearer Test Cases:**  Tests are more descriptive, explicitly stating the input and expected behavior/outcome.

3. **Edge Cases and Exceptions:**  Added tests for `test_get_url_invalid` to show how to check for `InvalidArgumentException`. Added `test_scroll_invalid_direction` to handle an invalid direction.

4. **`tmp_path` for File Handling:** The `test_save_cookies_localy` test now uses `tmp_path` (a pytest fixture) to create a temporary file for cookies. This prevents test pollution and ensures each test runs independently.

5. **Specific Assertions:** The comments now emphasize the need for specific assertions.   Crucially, tests need to validate that the *mocked* methods (or any actual methods) were called as expected.  For instance, if `get_url` is supposed to call the webdriver's `get` method, verify that `mock_webdriver.get` was called.

6. **Complete Example:** This example focuses on basic tests. You need to add more tests based on the specific methods and attributes in `driver.py`, including handling various possible exceptions, invalid inputs, and edge cases.

7. **Import from correct file:** The `from .driver import ...` line now assumes `driver.py` is in the same directory as the test file.  Adjust this if it's different.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_driver.py`).
3.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_driver.py`


Remember to replace the placeholder assertions with actual assertions based on the logic within your `driver.py` file.  Crucially, verify that the *mocked* `selenium` methods were called in the way you expect. Also, be aware of the differences between testing *mocking* and testing a real webdriver; mocking simplifies tests, but real webdriver interactions can expose unforeseen issues in the real world.
