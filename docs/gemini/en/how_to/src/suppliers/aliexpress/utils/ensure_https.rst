How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `ensure_https` that ensures a given URL string (or a list of URLs) starts with "https://". If the input is a product ID (not a full URL), it constructs a complete URL including the "https://" prefix and the default AliExpress item page.  The function handles both single strings and lists of strings as input.  Error handling is included to log invalid product IDs or URLs.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The function `ensure_https` takes a string or a list of strings (`prod_ids`) as input.

2. It checks if the input is a list. If it is, it iterates through each item in the list using a list comprehension.  For each item, it calls an inner function `ensure_https_single`.

3. If the input is not a list, it directly calls `ensure_https_single` with the input string.

4. The `ensure_https_single` function extracts the product ID from the input string using `extract_prod_ids` (this function is not provided, but assumed to be elsewhere in the codebase).

5. If a valid product ID is extracted, it constructs a URL with "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/" followed by the extracted product ID and ".html".

6. If no valid product ID is found, it logs an error message using the `logger` object (from `src.logger`) and returns the original input string unchanged.

7. The function returns the modified string (or list of strings) with the "https://" prefix appended if necessary.


Usage example
-------------------------
```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.utils.ensure_https import ensure_https

# Example 1: Single product ID
product_id = "example_product_id"
https_url = ensure_https(product_id)
print(https_url)  # Output: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/example_product_id.html

# Example 2: List of product IDs
product_ids = ["example_product_id1", "https://www.aliexpress.com/item/example_product_id2.html"]
https_urls = ensure_https(product_ids)
print(https_urls)  # Output: ['https://www.aliexpress.com/item/example_product_id1.html', 'https://www.aliexpress.com/item/example_product_id2.html']


# Example 3: Valid URL (no change)
valid_url = "https://www.example.com/item/example_product_id"
https_url = ensure_https(valid_url)
print(https_url)  # Output: https://www.example.com/item/example_product_id
```
