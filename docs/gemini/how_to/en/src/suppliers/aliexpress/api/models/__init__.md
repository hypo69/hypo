# Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/models/__init__.py

This file (`hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/api/models/__init__.py`) serves as an import module for various data models used in interacting with the AliExpress API.  It provides access to classes representing different aspects of AliExpress product data, request parameters, and responses.

**Classes Provided:**

* **`Language`:** Represents language options likely for filtering or localization related to AliExpress products.  You'll likely need to use the `Language` enum to specify a desired language in API requests.

* **`Currency`:** Defines currency options for AliExpress products. This is useful for displaying price information in different currencies.

* **`ProductType`**, **`SortBy`**, **`LinkType`:** These are likely enums defining various product types, sorting options, and link types. These are crucial parameters for querying AliExpress data.  Example usage will depend on the specific API calls.

* **`AffiliateLink`:** A class representing an affiliate link generated for an AliExpress product. This might hold data like the link, tracking IDs, and other affiliate-specific information.

* **`HotProductsResponse`:** A class representing the response structure from the API endpoint for getting trending or hot products. This will likely contain a list of `Product` objects.

* **`Product`:** A class representing a single product from AliExpress.  This class likely contains various attributes like `id`, `name`, `price`, `description`, `images`, `category`, etc.  Critically, use this class to access and manipulate product information.

* **`Category`**, **`ChildCategory`:** These likely represent the category structure of AliExpress products.  `Category` represents a parent category, while `ChildCategory` could represent subcategories.

**How to Use:**

To use these models in your code, import them from this module.

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.models import Language, Product, HotProductsResponse
```

**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.models import Product, ProductType, SortBy

# ... (API call to get hot products) ...
hot_products_response = get_hot_products()

# Assuming get_hot_products() returns a HotProductsResponse object
products = hot_products_response.products

for product in products:
    print(f"Product Name: {product.name}, Price: {product.price}")

# Example using ProductType and SortBy
products = get_products(product_type=ProductType.Electronics, sort_by=SortBy.PriceAsc)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **API Documentation:** Refer to the AliExpress API documentation for details on the expected input and output formats.  This code provides the data structures; the actual API interaction logic would need to be implemented elsewhere.
* **Error Handling:** Include error handling within your code to gracefully manage potential exceptions during API requests and data processing.
* **Data Validation:** Validate the data retrieved from the API before using it to prevent unexpected errors.
