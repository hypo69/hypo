This Python script, `header.py`, is a foundational module for the `hypotez` project. It sets up the project's environment, retrieves project settings, and defines various metadata.

**How to use it:**

1. **Project Structure:**  The script assumes a specific project structure with `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`, and `settings.json` (and optionally `README.MD`) within the project's root directory.

2. **Initialization:** The `set_project_root()` function is crucial. It locates the project's root directory by traversing up the directory tree until it finds one containing the specified marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). This function dynamically adds the root directory to `sys.path`, allowing import statements to find modules within the project.


3. **Settings Loading:**
   - The script attempts to load settings from a `settings.json` file located within the project's `src` directory.
   - Error handling (using `try...except`) is implemented to gracefully manage cases where `settings.json` is missing or corrupted (e.g., invalid JSON).  This prevents the script from crashing.

4. **Documentation Loading:**
   - Similarly, the script tries to read the `README.MD` file to extract project documentation.


5. **Metadata Extraction:**
   - The script extracts essential metadata (project name, version, author, copyright, coffee-funding link) from the `settings.json` file.
   - Default values are provided if the corresponding keys are missing in `settings.json`. This safeguards against issues where the settings file might not have all the required entries.

**Example Usage (in another module):**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.header import __project_name__
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.header import __version__

print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")
```

**Explanation of Important Parts:**

* **`set_project_root()`:** This function is critical. It ensures that modules within your project (like those in the `src` directory) can be imported.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are essential for robustness. They prevent the script from failing if the `settings.json` or `README.MD` files are missing or have incorrect formatting.

* **Default Values:**  Using `settings.get("key", default_value)` is a good practice for handling potential missing keys in the configuration files and prevents unexpected errors.

* **`__root__` Variable:** Using `__root__` in this way is a good convention (especially within a package) to store the path to the root, making it readily available throughout your project.


**Potential Improvements:**

* **More robust error handling:** You might want to log the errors instead of using `...`.
* **Explicit type hints:** Adding type hints to all variables could increase code readability and maintainability.
* **Configuration for marker files:** Instead of hardcoding the marker files, you could make this configurable from `settings.json` for greater flexibility.
* **External Validation of `settings.json`:** Consider using a schema (e.g., using `jsonschema`) to ensure the structure and data types within `settings.json` are valid, preventing issues with misconfigurations.
