### **product Module**: Product Management

The **product** module is responsible for managing all aspects of product data, including processing, validation, and field management. It consists of the following components:

1. **product.py**  
   Manages the core logic for handling products, including operations such as creating, updating, and deleting product records. It provides functions to process product data and ensures compliance with business rules for managing products within the application.

2. **product_fields**  
   Controls the logic related to product fields, handling field validation, formatting, and management. This module ensures that product fields meet the necessary criteria for consistent data entry, enabling accurate and efficient processing of product information.
```

**Improved Code**

```python
# product.py
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns  # Import necessary functions for JSON handling.
from src.logger import logger  # Import logger for error handling.

# product.py
# Module for managing product data.
#
# This module provides functions to create, update, and delete product records,
# ensuring compliance with business rules for managing products within the application.

    :return: A list of product dictionaries.

**Changes Made**

* Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` import statement to the `product.py` module.
* Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement to `product.py`
* Created a `load_products` function in `product.py` to handle loading data from a JSON file using `j_loads`.
* Added error handling using `try-except` blocks in `load_products` and used `logger.error` for logging errors.  
* Added docstrings (reStructuredText format) to the `load_products` function.
* Added placeholders (`...`) in `validate_field` for the validation logic to be implemented later.
* Added `TODO` items to indicate areas for further development.
* Created a `product_fields.py` module to handle product field logic, separating concerns.
* Added a docstring to the `validate_field` function in `product_fields.py`.
* Followed the requested use of single quotes (`'`) in Python code.
* Improved formatting and structure for better readability.
