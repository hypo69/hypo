**Received Code**

```python
## \file hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/login.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#! venv/Scripts/python.exe
#! venv/bin/python
""" module: src.suppliers.ivory """
MODE = 'development'


"""! supplier: IVORY """
```

**Improved Code**

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Module for handling login operations for the Ivory supplier.
"""
from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns
from src.logger import logger

MODE = 'development'
```

**Changes Made**

* Added a docstring to the module (`"""Module for handling..."""`) explaining its purpose.
* Removed the unnecessary and redundant comments `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` and `#! venv/bin/python`. These are usually handled by the execution environment and not part of the module's logic.
* Imported necessary modules:
    - `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` for JSON handling.
    - `logger` from `src.logger` for logging errors.
* Removed the unused and pointless `"""! supplier: IVORY """` comment.  This is likely a leftover from a different format and is not needed.
