## Changes Made

- Added type hints (`xls_file: Union[str, Path]`, return type `Dict[str, list] | None`) for better code readability and maintainability.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` to utilize custom JSON loading, as instructed.
- Added a `try-except` block around file opening to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions. This now uses the logger for error reporting.  
- Added RST-style docstrings to all functions, variables, and the module to improve documentation clarity.
- Fixed the function signature to accept a Path object for better type safety.
- Added error handling to check if the file exists before attempting to read it.
- Added explicit error handling to catch any exceptions during file reading, converting, or JSON parsing, and logging the errors using `logger`.
- Improved error messages for better debugging.
- Removed unnecessary `MODE` variable as it was not used.
- Corrected import for 'j_loads_ns'.
