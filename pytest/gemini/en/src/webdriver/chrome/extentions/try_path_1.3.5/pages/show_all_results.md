# - Error handling (using pytest.raises) within showAllResults (if applicable)
# - Edge cases for various input scenarios (e.g., large or complex results objects)
# - Specific tests for the updateDetailsTable function (if possible with the mock)


# Note:  We can't completely test the JavaScript without a full mock-up
# of the DOM interactions and actual browser functionality.  The tests
# above are focused on the showAllResults function's direct use of
# the input data.  More thorough testing would require more extensive
# mocking of the JavaScript environment.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now mocks `tryxpath`, `window`, and relevant functions (`updateDetailsTable`, `onError`, `makeDetailText`). This is crucial because we can't directly interact with the browser's DOM or JavaScript runtime in a `pytest` test.  The mock functions need to be adapted based on the actual functionality they represent in the JavaScript code.


2. **Simplified `showAllResults` Test:** The `showAllResults` function now only handles the initial data assignment, as demonstrated with the `js2py.eval_js` example.


3. **Test Fixtures:** A `results_data` fixture is added to provide test data conveniently.


4. **Test Cases:** Basic valid input and no-context tests are included.


5. **Missing Assertions:** Important placeholders are commented (`# Assertions to ...`) since, with the mocks, we can't make meaningful assertions on the expected DOM updates without a more comprehensive setup.


6. **Comprehensive Testing Considerations:**  The comments highlight the need for additional test cases: handling invalid data, error conditions, edge cases, and specifically testing `updateDetailsTable` if it is used in a meaningful way in the JavaScript.



**To further improve the tests:**

- **More Realistic Mocks:**  Implement mocks that more accurately simulate the DOM behavior and the effects of JavaScript DOM manipulation functions (e.g., `document.getElementById`).
- **Error Handling Tests:** Include tests that use `pytest.raises` to verify the `fu.onError` function is called with appropriate errors.
- **Data Validation Tests:** Test `showAllResults` with various scenarios of valid and invalid results object structures to ensure robustness.
- **`updateDetailsTable` Testing:** If possible, create test functions that directly exercise `updateDetailsTable` with different inputs, to confirm its functionality.
- **Integration with Browser API (if applicable):**  If the JavaScript code interacts with browser APIs (e.g., sending messages via `browser.runtime.sendMessage`), these interactions will need to be mocked in your tests.


Remember that testing JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM, browser APIs, or other external dependencies requires a more elaborate mocking strategy in pytest.  The provided tests, with the mocks, serve as a starting point to progressively add more sophisticated and comprehensive tests as you learn about the real implementation and needs of the code.
