**Changes Made**:

- Added a `get_version` function to encapsulate the version retrieval.  This makes the code more reusable and testable.
- Docstrings for the `get_version` function using RST format.
- Updated the `__copyright__` docstring to use reStructuredText directives (e.g., `.. _MIT License`) for better formatting and link the license. The content of the `__copyright__` was preserved but formatting was adapted.
- Changed `__version__` assignment from `__version__: str` to `__version__ = 'v1.1'` (this is the correct way to assign in Python).
- Added `-> str` type hints to the `get_version` function, improving type safety and readability.


**Explanation of Changes**:

The original code was just a collection of strings. The improved version encapsulates the version information into a function (`get_version`) and uses the recommended way for type annotations and docstrings, which are crucial for understanding and maintainability, especially for larger projects.  This is the standard approach for writing Python code in a structured way. Also, the `__copyright__` string was improved and formatted using RST's linking abilities to point to the license documentation.


**How to Test**:


```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.utils.version import get_version

def test_get_version():
    assert get_version() == "v1.1"
```
```
