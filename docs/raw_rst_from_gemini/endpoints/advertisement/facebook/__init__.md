# Note: This is a placeholder for potential docstrings.
#  Detailed docstrings are crucial for maintainability and understanding.


# Example of how to add a docstring to a function
#
# def my_function(param1, param2):
#   """
#   This function does something with param1 and param2.
#
#   Args:
#     param1: Description of param1.
#     param2: Description of param2.
#
#   Returns:
#     Description of the return value.
#   """
#   # Function body
#   pass
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Missing Docstrings:** The original code lacks crucial docstrings for the functions (`Facebook`, `FacebookFields`, `FacebookPromoter`, `get_event_url`).  These are vital for understanding how each component works. The example I added demonstrates how to include parameter and return value descriptions.

2. **Placeholder Docstrings:** I've added placeholder docstrings explaining the *purpose* of the various objects, functions, and variables in the `__init__.py` file.

3. **Maintainability:**  Docstrings are essential for others (and yourself in the future) to understand the code's behavior without having to delve into the implementation.


**How to proceed:**

* **Complete the docstrings:** Replace the placeholder comments with comprehensive docstrings for each function and class, including parameters, return values, and any potential exceptions that can be raised.  Be specific about what each function does.
* **Consider adding examples:** Often, docstrings can benefit from including examples that illustrate usage and demonstrate how the module or class is used.
* **Check for external dependencies:**  Specify the external libraries (`packaging`) used by the module.


**Example of improved `get_event_url` docstring:**

```python
from .promoter import FacebookPromoter, get_event_url

def get_event_url(event_id):
    """
    Retrieves the URL for a Facebook event given its ID.

    Args:
        event_id: The ID of the Facebook event.  Must be a valid string.

    Returns:
        The URL of the Facebook event.  Returns None if no event is found or if there is an error.
        Raises ValueError if event_id is invalid.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if event_id is not a valid Facebook event ID.
      HTTPError: if there's an error communicating with Facebook API.
      Exception: if there's a general error during the process.
    """
    # Implementation goes here
    try:
       # ... your code to fetch the URL ...
       return event_url
    except ValueError as e:
       raise ValueError(f"Invalid event ID: {event_id}") from e
    except Exception as e:
       raise Exception(f"Error retrieving event URL: {e}") from e
```

By adding detailed docstrings, you are significantly improving the code's readability, maintainability, and usability for others who might use or need to modify it later. Remember to be explicit about potential errors or exceptions that might occur.
