How to use the PsychologistTelgrambot
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code defines a Telegram bot (`PsychologistTelgrambot`) designed for psychological support. It utilizes the Google Gemini API for generating responses to user messages.  The bot handles various input types (text messages, voice messages, documents) and also includes logic for routing URLs to specific handlers.  It saves user messages to a log file on Google Drive. The bot leverages existing modules for handling Google Gemini requests and file I/O.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:**
    - The `PsychologistTelgrambot` class initializes with a Telegram bot token, a web driver (Chrome), a Google Generative AI model (Gemini), a system instruction file, and a list of questions.  These components are sourced from specific files on Google Drive using file reading functions.
    - It registers handlers for different types of Telegram messages (commands, text, voice, documents).

2. **Command Handling:**
    - `/start` command: Sends a welcome message.
    - `/help` command: (Likely) Provides help information.  (Not fully defined in provided code.)
    - Text messages: The bot analyzes incoming text messages, potentially routes them to specific handlers (like URL-based routing), logs them to a file, and uses the Gemini model to generate a response.
    - Voice messages:  Handles voice messages.
    - Document messages: Handles document uploads, saving their content to log.

3. **URL Routing:**
    - The `get_handler_for_url` method maps URLs (like those from websites, possibly e-commerce) to specific handler functions.

4. **Handler Functions (Example):**
    - `handle_suppliers_response`: Handles responses related to specific e-commerce suppliers' URLs. It uses a hypothetical `mexiron` object for scenario handling.
    - `handle_onetab_response`: Handles URLs from the OneTab website. It also uses `mexiron`.

5. **Question Handling:**
    - The `handle_next_command` retrieves a random question from a list and asks the Gemini model to provide an answer. This provides a basic Q&A functionality.

6. **Response Sending:**
    - The bot sends responses back to the user via Telegram.

7. **Error Handling:**
    - Basic error handling is in place for reading questions from the file.
   
8. **Execution:**
    - The code runs the bot application in polling mode using `asyncio.run(kt.application.run_polling())`.  This keeps the bot active and listening for user interactions.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example interaction (not fully runnable without complete context)
    # Replace 'your_token' with the actual bot token and other parameters as needed
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.hypo69.small_talk_bot.bot import PsychologistTelgrambot
    from src import gs  # Replace with correct import path if needed.


    # Assuming gs.credentials.telegram.hypo69_psychologist_bot is defined elsewhere
    kt = PsychologistTelgrambot()
    # ... (Other setup if necessary, like instantiating mexiron)

    # Simulate sending a message
    # Replace with your Telegram API interaction method
    # Example:
    # message = await update.message.text
    # await kt.handle_message(update, context)

    # ... subsequent bot interactions

    # For production usage, run the application with correct configuration
    # and setup from your project's entry point.
