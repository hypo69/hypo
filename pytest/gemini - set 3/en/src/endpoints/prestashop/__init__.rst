# Similar tests for other classes, including:
# - PrestaCategory
# - PrestaWarehouse
# - PrestaLanguage
# - PrestaShopShop
# - PrestaCustomer


# If your classes have methods, write tests for those methods as well.


# Example of a test for a method (replace with your actual method)
# def test_prestashop_get_products(mock_prestashop_api):
#     """Tests the get_products method of PrestaShop."""
#     products = mock_prestashop_api.get_products()
#     assert isinstance(products, list)
#     # Add more assertions based on expected product data.


# Important: Adapt these tests based on the actual methods and attributes
# of the classes in your `prestashop` module.  Replace placeholder values
# like "some_key" and "some_url" with appropriate data. Include tests
# for expected exceptions and edge cases (e.g., empty lists, None values)
# where applicable.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Structure:** The tests are organized by class, making them more maintainable.
* **Example Tests:**  Provides examples for `PrestaShop`, `PrestaProduct`, and `PriceListRequester` initialization.  Replace placeholders with appropriate class attributes.
* **Exception Handling:** Includes a `test_prestashop_init_invalid_key` to demonstrate testing for expected exceptions using `pytest.raises`.
* **Fixture Placeholder:**  Includes a placeholder for a `mock_prestashop_api` fixture if your `PrestaShop` class interacts with an external API or has complex dependencies.  This is **crucial** for isolating tests.
* **Comments:** Added docstrings to explain the purpose of each test.
* **Comprehensive Approach:** The provided tests are just starting points.  You need to add tests for all the classes and methods of the `prestashop` module.  Cover valid inputs, edge cases (e.g., empty lists, invalid data types), and situations where exceptions are expected.
* **Adaptability:** The tests are written in a way that's easily adaptable to the specific methods and attributes of your classes.


**How to Use:**

1.  **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
2.  **Save:** Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_prestashop.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/__init__.py` file.
3.  **Run Tests:** Execute the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_prestashop.py`


**Crucially:** Replace the placeholder comments and example assertions with the actual methods, attributes, and expected behaviors of your `PrestaShop` and other classes.  Thoroughly test all parts of the code. Remember to install any necessary external libraries if required.
