1. **product.py**  
   Manages the core logic for handling products, including operations such as creating, updating, and deleting product records. It provides functions to process product data and ensures compliance with business rules for managing products within the application.

2. **product_fields**  
   Controls the logic related to product fields, handling field validation, formatting, and management. This module ensures that product fields meet the necessary criteria for consistent data entry, enabling accurate and efficient processing of product information.
