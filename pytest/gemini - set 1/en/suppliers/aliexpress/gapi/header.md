```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  The tests now use `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock `open`. This is crucial for testing functions that interact with files without actually creating or modifying them.  This makes the tests more reliable and isolates the `get_project_root` function's behavior from the filesystem.  The `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary directories for testing, which is significantly better than manually creating and removing files.
* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive and clearly indicate the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_get_project_root_valid_input`).
* **Edge Case and Error Handling:** Tests now cover cases where the marker files don't exist, the current directory is the root, and there's a `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` while reading the `settings.json` or `README.MD` files.  These cases are critical to ensure robustness.
* **Comprehensive `get_project_root` testing:**  There are tests to cover both success (various valid file scenarios) and failure (nonexistent files) cases for `get_project_root`.


This revised solution is significantly better because it adheres to the requirements, is more robust, and demonStartes appropriate use of mocking and fixtures, making the tests reliable and easier to maintain. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging`, and `unittest.mock`) if you haven't already.  This example assumes that the `gs` module and its `path` attribute are properly defined elsewhere in your project.
