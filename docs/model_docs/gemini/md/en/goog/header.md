## Overview

This module, `header.py`, defines functions and variables for project initialization, including locating the project root directory, loading settings from a JSON file, and accessing documentation. It relies on the `gs` module (presumably for file system operations) and the `packaging.version` module for version handling.

## Functions

### `get_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project.

**Parameters**:
- `marker_files` (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root.  Defaults to `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`.

**Returns**:
- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.


**Raises**:
None


### Project Initialization

**Description**:
This section describes the code responsible for initializing the project by locating the root directory, loading settings, and obtaining project documentation.

**Code Explanation**:

- The `get_project_root` function is used to find the project root directory. It iteratively checks parent directories from the current file's path until it finds a directory containing one of the specified marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`). If the root directory isn't already in `sys.path`, it's added.
- The project root is stored in the `__root__` variable for later use.
- Settings are loaded from the `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory within the project root. This is handled by the `try-except` block, handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in case the file is missing or corrupted. If there's an issue, `settings` is set to `None`.
- Project documentation (e.g., `README.md`) is loaded from the `README.MD` file located in the `src` directory within the project root. It's also handled by the `try-except` block.
- Variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc., are populated from the loaded settings or defaults.


**Variables**:
- `__root__` (Path): Path to the root directory of the project.
- `settings` (dict | None): Dictionary containing project settings if loaded successfully; otherwise, `None`.
- `doc_str` (str | None): String containing the project documentation if loaded successfully; otherwise, `None`.
- `__project_name__` (str): Name of the project.
- `__version__` (str): Version of the project.
- `__doc__` (str): Project documentation.
- `__details__` (str): Project details.
- `__author__` (str): Project author.
- `__copyright__` (str): Project copyright.
- `__cofee__` (str): Links to support development.
