**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock` to mock the `Driver` and `Context` objects.  This is crucial for unit testing because it isolates the `Graber` class from external dependencies (like the actual WebDriver).  This makes the tests more reliable and faster.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init`).

3. **`@pytest.fixture` for `Graber`:**  A `pytest` fixture is used to create a `Graber` instance within each test. This ensures each test uses a fresh, isolated `Graber` object.


4. **Handling Decorator (close_pop_up):** The tests for the `close_pop_up` decorator are now commented out, because the decorator was commented out in the code.  If the decorator is uncommented, you'll need to implement mock behavior that emulates the expected behavior of calling `Context.driver.execute_locator`.


5. **Error Handling (TypeError):** Added a test (`test_graber_invalid_driver_type`) to demonStarte how to handle a `TypeError` if the `driver` argument is not of the expected type.

6. **Comprehensive Test Coverage (Important):** The tests should ideally cover all the different functions and methods within `Graber` (e.g., any other methods you may have added for gathering data). The provided tests are a good starting point but need to be expanded for complete coverage.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code in a file named `test_graber.py` (or similar).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal using: `pytest test_graber.py`

**Crucial Next Steps:**

- **Complete Function Coverage:** The tests above are basic examples.  You must add tests for all the specific functions in your `Graber` class, including any that are not covered in the example tests.
- **Valid Input Testing:** Test various valid input data for the relevant functions to verify correct behavior.
- **Invalid/Unexpected Input Testing:** Create tests to ensure the code handles invalid or unexpected data gracefully (e.g., wrong data types, missing fields) and raises appropriate exceptions.
- **Edge Case Testing:** Design test cases for boundary conditions or edge cases (e.g., empty lists, very large inputs).
- **Exception Handling:**  Thoroughly test exception handling using `pytest.raises`.


Remember to replace the mock objects with actual objects if you intend to use this code for real testing. Remember to install any necessary dependencies.
