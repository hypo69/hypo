**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Docstring:** The original code had a redundant docstring repeated.  The improved code has a single, clear, and descriptive docstring at the top of the file explaining the module's purpose. This is crucial for understanding the module's role within the larger project.

2. **Conciseness:**  The repeated lines `""" module: src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.tools """` are removed. The module's name is implicit from the file path.

3. **Clarity:**  The docstring now states what the module *does* rather than just saying what it *is*.  This makes the purpose immediately apparent.

4. **Function Mention:** The docstring now mentions the `get_product_id` function, giving the user a clear indication of the module's content.

These changes make the code more readable, understandable, and helpful for documentation purposes.  A good docstring is essential for maintainability and understanding of a module. Remember to update the docstrings for functions within the modules as well for even better documentation.
