### **ai Module**: AI Model Management

The **ai** module is responsible for managing various AI models, facilitating interaction with external APIs, and handling different configurations for data analysis and language processing. It includes the following submodules:

1. **anthropic**  
   Provides integration with Anthropic AI models, enabling tasks related to advanced language understanding and response generation.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/anthropic/README.MD)

2. **dialogflow**  
   Integrates with Google Dialogflow, supporting natural language understanding (NLU) and conversational AI functions for creating interactive applications.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/dialogflow/README.MD)

3. **gemini**  
   Manages connections with Gemini AI models, providing support for applications that require unique Gemini AI capabilities.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/gemini/README.MD)

4. **helicone**  
   Connects to Helicone models, providing access to specialized functions for customizing AI-based solutions.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/helicone/README.MD)

5. **llama**  
   Interface for LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), designed for tasks related to understanding and generating natural language in various applications.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/llama/README.MD)

6. **myai**  
   Custom AI submodule, developed for specialized model configurations and implementations, providing unique AI functions specific to the project.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/myai/README.MD)

7. **openai**  
   Integrates with OpenAI API, providing access to their suite of models (e.g., GPT) for tasks such as text generation, classification, translation, and more.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/openai/README.MD)

8. **tiny_troupe**  
   Provides integration with Microsoft's AI models, offering solutions for natural language processing and data analysis tasks using small, performance-optimized models.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/tiny_troupe/README.MD)

9. **revai**  
   Integrates with rev.com's model, specializing in working with audio files such as recordings of meetings, conferences, calls, and other audio materials.
   [Go to module](https://github.com/hypo69/hypo/blob/master/src/ai/revai/README.MD)
