**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the `EventHandler` class and its methods.  This significantly improves the readability and understanding of the code.  Docstrings explain what each method does, its inputs and expected outputs, and its role within the overall framework.  This is vital for maintainability and collaboration.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  While the original variable names were understandable, using more descriptive names (e.g., `snapshot` instead of just `text`) enhances the clarity of the code.
* **`flush=True`:**  Crucially, `flush=True` is used in the print statements. This ensures that the output is displayed immediately, preventing potential issues with buffering and displaying output in the correct order.
* **Type Hinting:**  The addition of `-> None` and type hints for the arguments improves code clarity and maintainability.


This revised version is significantly more robust, readable, and maintainable. It clearly demonstrates how to handle different event types during an OpenAI Assistant run, particularly those related to code interpretation,  and is thus better suited for a production environment or a collaborative project. Remember to initialize `OpenAI` client and other necessary components before using this `EventHandler` class. Remember that handling `ToolCallDelta` for code interpreters (or other tool types) requires explicit checks to avoid unexpected behavior.
