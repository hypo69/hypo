# Test for potential exceptions
# (If the code has any methods/functions that can raise exceptions)
# Example (assuming a function 'calculate_something'):
# def test_calculate_something_raises_exception():
#    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#        result = version.calculate_something(invalid_input)  # Replace invalid_input
#    assert str(excinfo.value) == "Specific error message"

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each test.

2. **Type Checking:** Includes checks to ensure that `__version__`, `__author__`, `__details__`, and `MODE` are of the expected type (strings).

3. **Empty String Checks:** Explicitly checks for empty strings to catch potential issues where these attributes might be unintentionally empty.

4. **Comprehensive Cases:** The tests cover the fundamental attributes of the module, including the `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, and `__details__`, as well as the `MODE`.

5. **Example for Exception Handling (commented out):**  A commented-out example demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to test for exceptions.  You should adapt this example to any exceptions the code might raise.

6. **Focus on Attributes:**  The tests are focused on verifying the values of the module's attributes as intended by the structure of the provided code.

7. **Docstrings:**  Includes docstrings for every test function, which are important for readability and maintainability.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a Python file (e.g., `test_version.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_version.py`.

This improved test suite provides a more thorough and robust verification of the functionality of the `version.py` module. Remember to uncomment and adapt the exception handling example if necessary. Remember to replace any placeholder comments with actual code from your `version.py` file as needed. Also, replace any placeholder function calls (`calculate_something`) with actual function calls or methods if applicable.
