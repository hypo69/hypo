**Changes Made**

* Added a docstring to the module (`__init__.py`) using reStructuredText (RST) format to describe the module's purpose and content.
* Added `from src.logger import logger` to use the logger for error handling.
* Improved the `MODE` variable by adding a comment.
* Added a placeholder function `init()` to demonstrate the module's intended use and added try/except block to handle potential exceptions during initialization and log them properly.
* Added a TODO item to remind about possible future imports.
* Formatted imports to be consistent.
* Changed from `json` to `j_loads` to adhere to requirements.
