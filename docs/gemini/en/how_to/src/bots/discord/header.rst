How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that dynamically determines the root directory of a project.  It searches up the directory tree from the current file's location until it finds a directory containing specific marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`).  If found, it adds the project root to Python's module search path (`sys.path`) and returns the `Path` object to the root directory. If the marker files are not found, it returns the directory where the script is located. The code then loads settings from `src/settings.json` and project documentation from `src/README.MD`, if these files exist.  Finally, it extracts and assigns values to various variables representing project information (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and coffee link) based on the loaded settings or default values if the files aren't found or if settings are invalid.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary libraries:** The code imports libraries `sys`, `json`, `packaging.version`, and `pathlib`.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker files as input.

3. **Determine the current file's path:** It gets the absolute path to the current Python file.

4. **Iterate through parent directories:** It iterates upwards through the parent directories of the current file's directory.

5. **Check for marker files:** For each parent directory, it checks if any of the specified marker files exist within that directory.

6. **Set project root and add to path:** If a directory with marker files is found, the project root is set to that directory and the directory is added to the Python module search path (`sys.path`).

7. **Return project root:**  The function returns the `Path` object to the root directory.

8. **Get project root:** The code calls `set_project_root()` to obtain the project root.

9. **Load project settings (settings.json):**  It tries to open and parse the `settings.json` file located within the project root directory.

10. **Handle potential errors:** If the `settings.json` file is not found or is not valid JSON, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions and proceeds without loading settings.

11. **Load project documentation (README.MD):** It attempts to read the content of the `README.MD` file from the project root directory and stores the content in the `doc_str` variable.

12. **Handle potential errors:** If the `README.MD` file is not found or there are issues reading it, it catches `FileNotFoundError` or similar exceptions and sets `doc_str` to an empty string.

13. **Assign project details:** It extracts project name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and coffee link from the `settings` dictionary (or default values).

14. **Return project information:** The code returns the determined project variables.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming the necessary libraries are installed)
    from hypotez.src.bots.discord.header import set_project_root

    # Call the function to get the project root.  Replace with the actual path to your header file
    project_root = set_project_root()

    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
