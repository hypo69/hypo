# Dependencies for the AliExpress Campaign Management Module

This document outlines the dependencies required for the `campaign` module, specifically focusing on the `ali_promo_campaign.py` script.  Understanding these dependencies is crucial for correctly installing and running the module.

## `ali_promo_campaign.py` Dependencies

This script relies on several external libraries and internal modules.  Understanding these dependencies will aid in setup and troubleshooting.

* **`src.suppliers.aliexpress`:** This is a crucial internal dependency.  It's likely this module contains various classes and functions essential for interacting with the AliExpress API or other AliExpress-related data sources.

* **`AliCampaignGoogleSheet`:** This is a specific class or module within the `src.suppliers.aliexpress` package.  It's dedicated to handling campaign data stored within a Google Sheet.  You'll need to ensure the `src.suppliers.aliexpress` package, including this component, is correctly installed and configured in your project.  This is often handled by ensuring the correct imports are included within the `ali_promo_campaign.py` file.


## Supporting Dependencies

While not used directly within `ali_promo_campaign.py`, these supporting modules are vital for the overall functionality of the `campaign` module:

* **`gspread`:** A Python library for interacting with Google Sheets API.  Ensure it's installed and configured.

* **`pandas`:** A data manipulation and analysis library used for processing the campaign data. This is often used for importing and preparing data from the Google Sheet.  Make sure `pandas` is correctly installed.

* **`src.settings.gs`:** This likely holds configuration settings for interacting with Google Sheets.  Verify correct configuration and file paths.


## How to Ensure Correct Installation and Usage

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install gspread pandas
   ```

2. **Verify `src.suppliers.aliexpress` and `AliCampaignGoogleSheet`:**
   * Confirm the `src.suppliers.aliexpress` package is part of your project's structure and that it is properly importable.
   * Ensure that `AliCampaignGoogleSheet` is correctly implemented and configured within the `src.suppliers.aliexpress` package. Verify your imports in `ali_promo_campaign.py`.


3. **Configure Google Sheet credentials:**
   * Carefully review and properly configure the credentials used in `src.settings.gs` to allow access to your Google Sheets account.  This is crucial for successful data interaction.


4. **Verify imports:**  Carefully check imports in `ali_promo_campaign.py` to ensure that all necessary modules and classes are being referenced correctly.

By addressing these dependencies, you should be able to use the `ali_promo_campaign.py` script without encountering errors related to missing libraries or incorrect configuration.  If issues persist, check the specific error messages and examine the relevant code segments for potential problems.
