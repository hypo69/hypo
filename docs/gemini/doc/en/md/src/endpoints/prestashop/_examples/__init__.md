# Module: hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/_examples/__init__.py

## Overview

This module contains initialization code for the PrestaShop examples.  It appears to primarily define a `MODE` variable, likely for setting execution modes (e.g., development, production).  Import statements for versioning and documentation from the `version` module are also present.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description:** A string variable, likely used to configure the execution mode of the examples.  Its value is currently set to 'dev'.

**Type:** str

**Value:** 'dev'


## Imports

### `from packaging.version import Version`

**Description:** Imports the `Version` class from the `packaging.version` module, used for version handling.


### `from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__`

**Description:** Imports the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` variables from the `version` module likely for version information and documentation.


## Missing Documentation

The provided Python code contains extensive docstrings and comments, however, most are incomplete and not well-formatted for automatic documentation extraction.


## Potential Issues

The docstrings are incomplete; they lack the crucial `Args`, `Returns`, and `Raises` sections needed for proper documentation.  A complete and consistent documentation approach across the module is lacking.  Additional details about the purpose of `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` are necessary.  The multiline strings (`"""..."""`) and comments are not structured correctly for automatic docstring extraction.
