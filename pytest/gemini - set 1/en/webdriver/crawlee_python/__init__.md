**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Class:** Since the provided code only defines a `MODE` constant and imports a class, we create a dummy `CrawleePython` class to have something to test.  Crucially, this example now includes proper exception handling.


2. **Comprehensive Tests:** We now have tests covering:
   - Valid `development` and `production` modes.
   - Invalid mode (raises `ValueError`).
   - `None` and empty string mode (raises `TypeError` and `ValueError`, respectively).
   - Mixed-case mode (which might be handled in a real-world case, but this is good practice to have).

3. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names are descriptive.

4. **`pytest.raises`:** Used correctly for exception testing.

5. **Edge Case Tests:** Added tests for `None` and empty string inputs.


6. **Fixture (placeholder):** A placeholder fixture is included.  In a real application, you would define your fixture to provide the necessary data for the tests if you need one.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code above as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_crawlee.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_crawlee.py` in your terminal.  pytest will automatically discover and execute the tests.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing (if applicable):**

* **Data Fixtures:** If your `CrawleePython` class interacts with external resources (e.g., configuration files, databases, or APIs), you will need to create appropriate fixtures to mock or provide data for these resources.
* **Mocking:** For tests involving external dependencies, you should use mocking (with libraries like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to isolate your tests and avoid relying on external services.
* **Real Input:** When testing user input, provide various types of input, including valid and invalid types.
* **Boundary Conditions:** Test the limits of your functions by passing very large numbers, very small numbers, or extreme values to validate their behavior.



This enhanced example now provides comprehensive tests covering valid and invalid inputs, including proper exception handling for invalid data, which is critical in robust software testing. Remember to replace the placeholder fixture with your actual data if needed in a real application. Remember to install pytest (`pip install pytest`).
