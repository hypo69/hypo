# Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/suppliers/amazon/scenario.py`

This file contains the Amazon scenario logic for the `hypotez` project, responsible for collecting product data from Amazon category pages.

## Function: `get_list_products_in_category(s)`

This function retrieves the URLs of products listed on a given Amazon category page.

**Parameters:**

*   `s`: A `Supplier` object. This object should contain the necessary information about the supplier, including the web driver instance (`s.driver`) and locators (`s.locators['category']`).

**Returns:**

*   A list of product URLs.  Returns `None` if no product URLs are found, or if there's an error locating the links.

**Error Handling:**

*   If the locators (`s.locators['category']`) are not found or empty, an error message is logged and `None` is returned.
*   If no product links are found, a warning message is logged.

**Functionality:**

1.  Retrieves the web driver instance (`d`) and category locators from the `Supplier` object.
2.  Scrolls the page (likely to load more products).  **Crucially, this function *currently* lacks pagination handling.  This is marked as `TODO`.**
3.  Executes the locator to find product links using `d.execute_locator(l['product_links'])`.
4.  Handles the case where the result is a single string (instead of a list) by wrapping it in a list.
5.  Logs the number of products found.
6.  **Crucially, the commented-out code block demonstrates a *potential* but *missing* database interaction.** It checks if the product already exists in the database (using a placeholder `PrestaShopProduct.check()`). If it exists, it proceeds to the next item in the list.  **This functionality is not implemented and should be added.**
7.  Returns the list of product URLs.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code now handles cases where locators are missing or product links aren't found, providing more informative error messages.
*   **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names improve readability.
*   **Comments:** Added comments explaining the logic and potential issues for clarity.
*   **Type Hints:** Added type hints for better code understanding and maintainability.

**How to use:**

```python
# Assuming you have a Supplier object 'supplier_instance'
# and 'supplier_instance.driver' is properly initialized.
product_urls = get_list_products_in_category(supplier_instance)

if product_urls:
    for url in product_urls:
        # Process each product URL
        # ... your code to grab product page and parse data ...
else:
    print("No product URLs found or error occurred.")
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pagination:** The current code lacks pagination.  Implement logic to handle multiple pages of products.
*   **Database Interaction:** The database check is crucial. Implement the `PrestaShopProduct.check()` method and update the code to correctly interact with your database to prevent duplicate processing.
*   **Robust Locators:** Ensure that the locators (`s.locators['product_links']`) are accurately identifying the product links on the Amazon category pages.  Thorough testing is needed.
*   **Supplier Object:** The `Supplier` object needs to be correctly initialized, including handling the web driver.


This improved guide provides a more comprehensive understanding of the function's purpose, potential issues, and ways to improve its functionality. Remember to address the `TODO` items to make this function production-ready.
