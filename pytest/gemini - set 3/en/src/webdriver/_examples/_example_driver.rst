**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mock Objects (Crucial):** The code now includes `MockChrome`, `MockFirefox`, and `MockEdge` classes.  These are vital because the original code interacts with external libraries (webdrivers).  You *cannot* directly test these interactions without mocks or a way to isolate the web driver behavior.  The `monkeypatch` is used to replace the actual classes with the mock ones.

2. **Capturing Output:** The `MyStream` class is a mock stream that allows us to capture the print output during the test execution.  This allows us to check that the correct messages are printed.

3. **`monkeypatch` (Crucial):**  This is used in the test functions `test_main_chrome`, `test_main_firefox`, and `test_main_edge` to modify the `Driver` class's attributes to use the mock webdriver classes, allowing us to avoid actual driver initialization which is essential for unit testing.

4. **Placeholder Tests:** Tests for functions like `get_url`, `extract_domain`, and `scroll` are marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` because they need real web driver implementations to run.  You should replace these placeholders with actual tests once you have access to those implementations.  Example of `pytest.raises` usage is also provided as a template.

5. **Output Assertions:** The test cases check for the expected output messages (e.g., "Successfully navigated to..." and "Chrome browser closed") that were printed by the original `main` function.

6. **Import Statements:** Updated `import` statements.

**How to proceed:**

* **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
* **Implement Mock Browser Classes:** Create appropriate mock classes based on the actual `Chrome`, `Firefox`, and `Edge` classes if possible, or simulate their behavior (at least for the method calls used in your code).
* **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the `@pytest.mark.skip` functions with real tests that verify that the web driver methods are called correctly, and return the expected values. Use `pytest.raises` for testing exceptions, and consider boundary conditions and edge cases.
* **Run Tests:** `pytest` will now run the tests, but because of the mocks, they will pass without actually interacting with a real browser.


This improved solution addresses the critical need for mocking the external dependencies to make the tests truly unit-testable, allowing you to verify the internal logic of your `Driver` class independently of the actual webdriver. Remember to replace the placeholder tests and mocks with your actual implementations. Remember also that your actual webdriver library may require specific methods and attributes to be mocked and verified appropriately.
