```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `j_loads_ns` and `execute_locator`. This is crucial for testing internal logic without relying on an actual browser and avoids external dependencies. The `mock_driver` fixture provides a mocked `Driver` object.  This is much more robust than relying on a real driver for tests.

2. **Exception Handling:** The `test_get_links_no_such_element` and `test_get_links_invalid_driver` test cases demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions, like `NoSuchElementException`.

3. **Empty Locator:** The `test_get_links_empty_locator` tests the case when the locator returns an empty list.

4. **Invalid Driver:**  The `test_get_links_non_driver_input` test now correctly tests a non-driver input, showing how to use `pytest.raises(TypeError)` to check for type mismatches.

5. **Missing Locator File:**  The `test_get_links_locator_not_found` test covers a critical edge case where the locator file doesn't exist.  This is essential because `FileNotFoundError` is now a possible outcome.

6. **Fixture for Locator:** The `locator` fixture is introduced to streamline the process of loading the locator data. This eliminates the need to read the file multiple times in the test functions.

7. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive, making the tests easier to understand.

8. **Import Fix:** Added `import json` and `import pathlib`.  Crucially, `import json` is needed to use `json.load` (which is needed to load `chats_list.json`).


**How to use:**

1. **Replace `'https://chatgpt.com/'`:** In the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block,  *do not* replace `d.get_url('https://chatgpt.com/')` with anything.  That line makes use of a real browser instance! Just keep it commented out. For tests, you are using the mock driver.


2. **Create `chats_list.json`:** Create a `chats_list.json` file in the proper directory structure (as shown in the file path in the `locator` fixture).  This file will need to contain valid JSON data (or you can change `chats_list.json` and this test code accordingly for dummy locator data).


3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/chat_gpt/scenarios/test_grab_links_to_chats.py
   ```

This revised answer provides a much more comprehensive and robust set of tests. Remember to adapt the test cases further based on the specific requirements of your code. Remember to adapt the JSON file used to match any expected structure of the returned locator data.
