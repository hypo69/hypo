**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import Correctly:**  The code now correctly imports the `Chrome` class from the specified module.

2. **Placeholder Replacement:**  Crucially, I've replaced placeholders like `"some_url"` with comments explaining that you need to replace them with actual values relevant to your specific `Chrome` class implementation.  This is _essential_ because the code cannot run without the actual class and its methods.

3. **Specific Error Handling:**  The `test_chrome_method_invalid_input` example shows how to use `pytest.raises` to assert that a particular exception type (`ValueError` in this case) is raised with the correct message.  Adapt this to the exceptions you expect from your `Chrome` class.

4. **Method Existence Check (Crucial):**  The `test_chrome_method_example` now checks if the `start_session` method exists *before* calling it, preventing cryptic errors if the method doesn't exist.

5. **Realistic Test Cases:** The examples now show tests for object instantiation (including potential invalid inputs), a method call, and exception handling, demonStarting a more complete test suite.  

6. **Comprehensive Testing Startegy:**  The comment after the example indicates the need to add many more tests to cover various scenarios related to your specific class methods, inputs, and outputs.

**To Use These Tests:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Fill in the actual class name and method names in the tests, replacing the comments.
2. **Implement the Chrome Class:**  Ensure the `Chrome` class exists and has the methods that your tests are checking (e.g., `start_session`, `invalid_method`).
3. **Run the Tests:** Run the `pytest` command in the directory containing the test file.


This improved solution provides a much stronger foundation for creating a comprehensive test suite for your `Chrome` class. Remember to add more tests to cover the complete functionality of the class and the various possible inputs. Remember the principles of good test design - test each method independently and consider boundary conditions.
