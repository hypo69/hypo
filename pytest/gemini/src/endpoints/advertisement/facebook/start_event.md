# ... (Other test cases as needed for different input conditions, exceptions, etc.)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The solution now utilizes `unittest.mock.patch` to effectively mock the `Driver` and `FacebookPromoter` objects.  This is crucial for testing `start_event.py` without relying on external dependencies like a Facebook API or a real browser.


2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The `test_run_events_valid_input` test verifies that the expected event is included in the events list. This is a crucial aspect of testing the logic.

3. **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` makes testing different events much more efficient.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** I've added `test_run_events_invalid_event` to handle the case where an event name is not in the event list.

5. **Error Handling:**  The solution includes a simple `test_run_events_no_video` example. You'll need to add more tests that deal with specific error conditions or exceptions if those are present in the original code.

6. **Fixtures:** The solution includes the necessary fixtures (`mock_driver`, `mock_logger`) for the tests.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_start_event.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_start_event.py`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Detailed Mocking:**  The `MockFacebookPromoter` now does more than just stub methods.  Crucially, it checks if the correct event name is passed.
*   **Real-world Error Handling:**  The original `start_event.py` has a `try...except` block.  Your tests need to cover potential exceptions (e.g., JSON parsing errors, network issues, etc.) that might arise during the Facebook API interaction.
*   **Data-driven Tests:**  Use parameterization with `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the same test with different input data.

Remember to adapt the test cases to accurately reflect the specific functionality and error conditions present in the original `start_event.py` code.  The provided tests are a good starting point, but you need to expand them based on the full logic of the code.
