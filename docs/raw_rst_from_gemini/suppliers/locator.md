```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling and Context:** The `try...except` blocks now include `from e` in the `raise` statements. This is crucial.  If you catch an exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`) and re-raise it, the original traceback information is preserved, making debugging much easier.
* **`supplier_prefix` Validation:** Added a `TypeError` check to ensure that `supplier_prefix` is a string. This is a crucial defensive programming step that prevents unexpected behavior.
* **Pathlib:** Changed `gs.path.src / ...` to use `Path` objects directly from `pathlib`. This is more Pythonic and provides more robust path manipulation.
* **`locators_path.exists()`:** Added a check using `locators_path.exists()`. This is more efficient than trying to open the file and then catching the exception, as it avoids unnecessary file operations.
* **Docstring Enhancements:** Improved docstrings for clarity.  Specified that `supplier_prefix` should be a string, added an example, and improved the description of the `locator` attribute to better indicate it's a structured representation.
* **Clearer Exception Messages:** Modified the error messages to be more informative about the exact location of the file that was not found.

These changes make the code more robust, readable, and maintainable, especially in a production environment. Remember to replace `gs.path.src` with the correct path to your `src` directory. Remember to install `pathlib` if you haven't already.  If the package `jjson` is not installed in your environment, you will need to install it first, e.g., `pip install jjson`. This improved code is more resilient to various problems, easier to debug, and more aligned with Python best practices.
