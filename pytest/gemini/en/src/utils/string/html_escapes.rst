**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  Tests now cover valid inputs, edge cases (Unicode characters), and the critical case of missing keys, addressing the prompt's requirements more thoroughly.
* **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test exception handling for `KeyError` and `TypeError` cases.
* **Realistic Edge Cases:** The `test_html_escapes_missing_key` and `test_html_escapes_non_string_key` tests show how `pytest` can validate for situations that might not have been anticipated.
* **Example Usage (commented out):**  Illustrative examples of how to use the dictionary, which helps contextualize the tests.
* **Handles empty dictionary:** Added a test for an empty dictionary which would never be used, but is a valid possibility that the test should still work with (and fail with appropriate error handling).
* **Specific error types:** Now more specifically testing for the expected `KeyError` and `TypeError`.


This revised solution provides a more robust set of tests that cover various aspects of the `html_escapes` dictionary, increasing confidence in its reliability. Remember to save the tests in a Python file (e.g., `test_html_escapes.py`) and run them with `pytest`. Remember to replace `"hypotez/..."` with the actual path to your `html_escapes.py` file.
