## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/webdriver/__init__.py`

This module provides a collection of classes for interacting with web browsers using Selenium and other tools.  It simplifies the process of setting up and controlling browser instances for web automation tasks.

**How to use:**

This module exports various classes to create and manage different browser drivers.  The general pattern for using these drivers is:

1. **Import the desired driver class:**
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.webdriver import Chrome
   ```
   or
   ```python
   from hypotez.src.webdriver import Firefox
   ```
   and so on, for each respective driver.

2. **Instantiate the driver:**
    ```python
    driver = Chrome()
    # or
    driver = Firefox()
    ```

3. **Use the driver's methods:**
   The `Driver` class (and its subclasses) provide methods to interact with the browser, such as opening URLs, clicking elements, filling forms, etc.  Refer to the individual driver class documentation (e.g., `hypotez/src/webdriver/chrome.py`) for specifics.

   ```python
   # Example (assuming you have a way to import necessary elements like URL and locators)
   driver.get("https://www.example.com")
   element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "myElement")
   element.click()
   ```

**Driver Types:**

The module provides different browser driver types:


* **`Chrome`:**  Manages Chrome browser sessions.
* **`Firefox`:** Manages Firefox browser sessions.
* **`Edge`:** Manages Microsoft Edge browser sessions.
* **`BS`:**  Likely interacts with Beautiful Soup for web scraping (details needed to clarify usage).
* **`Playwrid`:** Likely uses Playwright for browser automation.  Further detail required.
* **`CrawleePython`:**  Possibly handles crawling tasks, specific usage unclear from the provided file alone.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Dependencies:** This code likely relies on Selenium, Playwright, and possibly other libraries for web automation.  Ensure these dependencies are installed correctly.  (e.g., `pip install selenium playwright`).
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `try...except` blocks to manage potential exceptions during browser interactions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`, network issues, etc.).
* **Browser Settings:**  Configure browser options (e.g., headless mode, window size) as needed for your automation scenarios within the instantiation (e.g. `driver = Chrome(headless=True, options=...)`).
* **`MODE = 'dev'`**: This variable's purpose is unclear from the file snippet alone.  Investigate its use within the driver classes. Its purpose should be documented for clarity.

**Further Documentation Needed:**

To provide a complete and usable guide, please also provide:

* The documentation for each driver class (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge`, etc.).
* The usage of the `MODE` variable.
* Example code demonstrating common use cases for each driver.
