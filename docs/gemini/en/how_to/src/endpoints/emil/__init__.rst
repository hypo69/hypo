How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block initializes a module named `emil`. It sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev', and imports the `EmilDesign` class from the `emil_design` module within the same directory.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code defines a constant `MODE` and assigns it the string value 'dev'. This likely represents the current operating mode for the `emil` module, possibly for development or testing.

2. The code imports the `EmilDesign` class from the `emil_design` module. This assumes a module named `emil_design` exists in the same directory and defines the `EmilDesign` class. This import statement allows other parts of the `emil` module to use the `EmilDesign` class.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming emil_design.py exists and contains the EmilDesign class
    # and you're in a python file that can import emil
    import hypotez.src.endpoints.emil

    # Access the mode
    print(hypotez.src.endpoints.emil.MODE)


    # Example using EmilDesign (if available)
    # This needs an emil_design module with a class EmilDesign
    # and its corresponding code to create an instance.
    try:
        design_instance = hypotez.src.endpoints.emil.EmilDesign()
        print(design_instance)  # or whatever you do with the instance
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"EmilDesign not found: {e}")
