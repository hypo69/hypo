```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src._examples.quick_start as qs

# Tests for the MODE constant
def test_mode_constant():
    """Checks the value of the MODE constant."""
    assert qs.MODE == 'dev'


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided Python code (`hypotez/src/_examples/quick_start.py`) is largely empty, containing only docstrings and comments.  This prevents us from writing meaningful tests.  The provided solution now only tests the `MODE` constant, which is the only truly testable part of the original code.

**Why other tests aren't needed (and what is missing):**

* **Functions/Classes:**  The code doesn't define any functions or classes that can be tested.  Without functions or methods, there's nothing to verify functionality.
* **Input/Output:** There are no variables or functions that take input and produce output.

**How to proceed if you provide more code:**

To create comprehensive tests, please provide a complete Python file (e.g., `quick_start.py`) that defines functions, classes, or methods.  The tests should then focus on checking the correctness of these components using various inputs and edge cases.  The example structure provided in the prompt will then be highly relevant.

**Example of a more useful test suite (if functions were added):**

```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src._examples.quick_start as qs

def test_my_function_valid_input():
    # Replace with actual function and valid input
    result = qs.my_function(10)  
    assert result == 20 #Example assertion

def test_my_function_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        qs.my_function("hello")  #Example raising exception

def test_my_function_zero_input():
    result = qs.my_function(0)
    assert result == 0  #Test for an edge case


```

Remember to replace `qs.my_function` with the actual function name and  modify assertions to test the real functionality of the function.  Provide the actual Python code, and I can write more targeted and useful tests.
