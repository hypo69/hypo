.. module:: src.product.product_fields
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Defines each product field for PrestaShop tables.

 <b>Class `ProductFields` Defines each product field for PrestaShop tables.</b>
langdetect in Python is used to determine the language of text. It relies on the language-detection library, developed by Google, and uses the Naive Bayes method for text language classification.

------

Example usage of langdetect for language detection:

.. code-block:: python

    from langdetect import detect, detect_langs

    # Detect the language of the text
    text = "Bonjour tout le monde"
    language = detect(text)
    print(f"Detected language: {language}")

    # Detect probabilities of multiple languages
    languages = detect_langs(text)
    print(f"Detected languages: {languages}")

.. code-block:: python

    from langdetect import detect, detect_langs, LangDetectException

    try:
        text = "Bonjour tout le monde"
        language = detect(text)
        print(f"Detected language: {language}")
        languages = detect_langs(text)
        print(f"Detected languages: {languages}")
    except LangDetectException as ex:
        print("Error detecting language", ex)


.. todo:: Thoroughly investigate langdetect's operation.

Class field names correspond to PrestaShop table field names.
Field order in this file follows the field order in the table.
The code later uses alphabetical order for consistency.

**Explanation of Improvements and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **Removed Redundant `@associations.setter`:** The initial code had a redundant `@associations.setter` for the `associations` property.  The second one was unnecessary and is now removed.

2. **Placeholder for Language Data:** The crucial `self.language` dictionary is now a placeholder.  **You MUST replace this with a method that fetches the list of languages and their IDs from your PrestaShop client.**  This is absolutely essential for proper multi-lingual support.

3. **Corrected Type Hinting:** Type hints are added and improved to clearly specify the expected types of data in the setter methods, e.g., `value: int = None` or `value: str = None`.

4. **Clearer Error Handling:** The error handling within setter methods is improved.  Instead of simply printing error messages, the code now logs them using `logger.error()` with detailed context, including the attempted value.  **Importantly, exceptions are caught and handled properly, preventing crashes.**

5. **`_load_product_fields_list`:**  This function now is correctly loading the file contents as a list.


**How to Use (Illustrative Example):**

```python
from hypotez.src.product.product_fields.product_fields import ProductFields

pf = ProductFields()

# Example setting a product ID
pf.id_product = 123

# Accessing the field (important to handle potential `None`)
product_id = pf.id_product or "Not found" # Handle case where the field is unset
print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")

# ... (rest of your code)
```

**Critical Missing Pieces (Not in the Code Snippet):**

* **Language Management:** The `self.language` dictionary is completely wrong.  You need a method that fetches language data from your PrestaShop API. This method should also accommodate different types of languages and handle potentially inconsistent data formats coming from PrestaShop.  This is fundamental.

* **Data Validation:**  The code lacks thorough validation (e.g., ensuring that `id_product` is actually a positive integer or that a `price` is a valid numeric value).  Implement proper data validation (using `pydantic` or other tools) to avoid unexpected errors at runtime.

* **PrestaShop API Interaction:** The code doesn't interact with the PrestaShop API.  You need functions that fetch, update, and create product data in PrestaShop, using the `pf` object to hold the formatted product information.

* **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve logging and error handling further to log exception details in the `logger`.

* **Proper `product_fields_default_values.json`:** Ensure that this JSON file has correct data structure for all the fields defined in your PrestaShop product table.  In the example, there's a placeholder, not a properly formatted JSON.

* **Import Statements (and `header`):** Ensure you have all necessary imports in your file and you're importing `header` correctly if it's used in your context.

By addressing these issues, your code becomes much more robust, efficient, and maintainable.  It's vital to create good structure and validation to prevent unexpected errors in a production environment.
