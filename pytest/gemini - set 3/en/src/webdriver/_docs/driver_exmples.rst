**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Clearer Assertions:**  The previous responses lacked strong assertions.  Now, tests explicitly check for `True` or `False` return values, correct types, and expected outcomes.  Crucially, the `assert` statements now relate to *specific aspects* of the method's behavior, as opposed to simply checking for existence.

* **Error Handling:** The `test_get_url_invalid` test example demonstrates handling *invalid* inputs.

* **Data-Driven Tests:**  A `@pytest.fixture` is introduced to provide the `chrome_driver_instance`. This is crucial for isolating tests.

* **More Comprehensive Tests:** The test suite now covers a wider range of functionalities, including edge cases like invalid URLs and custom user agents.

* **Realistic Assertions (Important):** The `test_save_cookies_localy` and other tests now mention that the assertion strategies depend on the *implementation* details of those specific functions in your `Driver` and `Chrome` classes.  You must replace the placeholder assertions with your actual assertions that verify what `_save_cookies_localy` *should* do.   Simply asserting `True` isn't sufficient in most realistic scenarios.

* **Dependencies:** The code now assumes your classes,  `src.webdriver.Driver` and `src.webdriver.Chrome`,  and `selenium` are imported correctly.  Import statements are essential.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_webdriver.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_webdriver.py` from your terminal.


**Critical Next Steps (for practical testing):**

*   **Replace Placeholders:** The `assert` statements for `test_save_cookies_localy` and related functions need *actual* conditions that reflect what success and failure look like in your implementation.
*   **Mocking (If applicable):** If `chrome_driver_instance.get_url` interacts with external resources or other parts of your system, you might need mocking to test it reliably without depending on the actual system.


This revised example provides a much better starting point for robust and realistic tests of your `Driver` and `Chrome` classes. Remember to adapt the assertions and tests to the specific behavior of your code. Remember to install pytest if you don't have it already. `pip install pytest`
