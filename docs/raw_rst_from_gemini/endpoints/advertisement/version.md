**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now includes a `print` statement to display the error message. This is crucial for debugging.  More robust error handling might involve raising a custom exception or logging the error.
* **Pathlib:** The code now uses `pathlib.Path` to construct the path to `settings.json`. This is significantly better than string manipulation because it handles different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) correctly.  The string-based approach (`__root__ / 'src' /  'settings.json'`) was potentially problematic with how the current working directory might be different from the location of the file.
* **Variable Naming:**  Python naming conventions prefer `snake_case` (e.g., `__version__` to `__version` or `__cofee__` to `__cofee`). This small change improves readability.
* **Explicit Variable Assignment:**  The code now uses explicit assignments (`__version__ = ...`) instead of implied assignments.  This makes the code slightly more readable.
* **`if settings` conditions:** The `if settings` checks are already good, but they are explicit now to emphasize that only if the `settings` dict is valid will the code access it's values. This also makes it less surprising if `settings` was never initialized.
* **Corrected spelling:** changed `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** If `settings.json` is missing or invalid, the current code prints an error but continues. A more robust solution would likely raise a more specific exception.
* **Default values:** If `settings.json` is missing or an error occurs, there may be unexpected behavior in the rest of the project (e.g., if the values from settings.json are used as arguments to functions).  Consider setting default values for those settings or having the application stop with a more descriptive message.
* **Logging:** For production code, you would likely use a logging framework (e.g., `logging`) to record errors more comprehensively, especially the error message `e` from the `try-except` block.


This improved version is safer, more readable, and follows best practices for Python code. Remember to adapt the error handling strategy to match your project's needs.  If you intend to raise exceptions from this script, the error handling needs to be adjusted to reflect a suitable response.
