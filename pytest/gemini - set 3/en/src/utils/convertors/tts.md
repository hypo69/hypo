**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The tests now effectively mock the `requests` library to simulate successful and failed downloads. This avoids actual network requests, making the tests faster and more reliable.
* **Temporary Files:** Creates temporary files for testing `speech_recognizer` with local files. The `tmpdir` fixture from `pytest` ensures that the files are deleted after the tests.
* **Error Handling:** Includes more comprehensive tests for exception handling, checking for different potential errors.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Uses `assert` statements with more descriptive messages to indicate expected outcomes.  Crucially, the tests now *expect* a particular error message, as the original code returns strings to indicate errors, and *that* needs to be tested, as well as any non-error cases.
* **`asyncio` Handling**: Added `asyncio.run` to properly handle the asynchronous function `text2speech`.
* **Complete Test Coverage:** The tests now include various scenarios (valid input, invalid URL, exceptions) for both functions.
* **pytest.raises:**  While not explicitly used for `speech_recognizer`, the test ensures that expected exceptions (e.g., for invalid URLs) are caught appropriately.
* **`tmpdir` fixture:** Used to create temporary files and ensure they are cleaned up.
* **Language Specification**: Improved language handling in `speech_recognizer` and added tests for different languages.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest`


**Important Considerations for real-world testing:**

* **Audio Data:** For real-world testing, you'll need appropriate audio files. Create a set of example audio files (valid and invalid) to use in your tests.
* **Speech Recognition Accuracy:**  Speech recognition is not perfect. Include tests that verify the recognized text is what you expect, given your audio input.  Just verifying that an error message comes back isn't sufficient; the *meaning* of the error, and what the code returns in valid cases, must be tested.
* **External Services:** If you depend on external services (e.g., a speech recognition API), consider simulating the external service responses and ensuring that all potential responses (including errors) are handled correctly in your code.  Don't test the API itself; test the function's *behavior* in different API response scenarios.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# Replace with expected output`) with the actual expected recognized text for each test case using valid audio example files.
