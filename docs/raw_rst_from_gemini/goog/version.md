__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''

```

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Corrected `copyright` typo:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"`.  This is a crucial fix; typos in variable names will lead to errors.
* **Clearer Error Handling:**  The `print()` statement within the `try...except` block provides informative feedback to the user if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted.  This is better than just silently using defaults.
* **Consistent Variable Names:** Using `__version__` (with a double underscore) is now in line with the other constants.  This is a good practice for Python.
* **Docstring:** While the prompt doesn't ask for a complete docstring, adding some basic documentation would be useful:

```python
"""
This module defines constants related to the project's version, author,
copyright, and other details. It loads data from settings.json if
available.  If settings.json is not found or is invalid, defaults are used.
"""
```

**How to use:**

This `version.py` file should now be imported into other modules to access the variables.  For example:

```python
import goog.version as v

print(v.__version__)  # Access the version
print(v.__author__)
```

**Crucial Considerations:**

* **`settings.json`:**  This file is critical.  Make sure it exists in the correct location (`../settings.json`) relative to `version.py` and contains valid JSON data.
* **Error Handling:**  The error handling is very important.  It helps prevent unexpected crashes if `settings.json` is missing or if it's not correctly formatted.
* **`venv`:**  The `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` shebang line is essential if you're using a virtual environment.  This ensures the correct Python interpreter is used.

This revised code is much more robust and user-friendly. Remember to adapt the code to your specific project structure if necessary. Remember to add a `settings.json` file in the correct location to test the code.
