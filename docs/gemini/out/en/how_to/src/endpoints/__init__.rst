How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code initializes a module named `src.endpoints`.  It sets a variable `MODE` to the string 'dev'.  Crucially, it imports several other classes from various submodules within the `src.endpoints` directory.  While the import statements are commented out, they show the intended usage and structure of the module.  These imports likely handle interactions with different e-commerce platforms and/or services (e.g., PrestaShop, Kazarinov).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file sets the `MODE` variable to 'dev'.
2. The file imports classes from other modules within the `endpoints` folder. These imports are currently commented out, which effectively disables the import and functionality of the classes.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # This is a demonStartion of potential usage but is not executable because the imports are commented out
    # in the original code.  To use, uncomment the relevant import statements.

    # Example (assuming the imports are uncommented):
    # from .prestashop import PrestaShop
    #
    # shop = PrestaShop(...) #  Use the PrestaShop class to interact with PrestaShop
    #
    # # Further actions would use the instantiated 'shop' object to access or manipulate PrestaShop data.
    #
    # print(MODE)  # Prints 'dev'
