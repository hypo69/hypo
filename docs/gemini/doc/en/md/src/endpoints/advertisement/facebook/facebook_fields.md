# hypotez/src/endpoints/advertisement/facebook/facebook_fields.py

## Overview

This module defines the `FacebookFields` class, responsible for loading and managing Facebook advertisement fields from a JSON file. It uses the `j_loads` function from the `src.utils.jjson` module to parse the JSON data.  It leverages the `logger` from `src.logger` for debugging purposes and `gs.path.src` to construct the file path.


## Classes

### `FacebookFields`

**Description**: This class loads Facebook advertisement fields from a JSON file and makes them accessible as attributes.

**Methods**

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `FacebookFields` object.

#### `_payload`

**Description**:  Loads the Facebook fields from the JSON file.  It populates the class instance with the fields as attributes.

**Implementation Details**:

1. Loads the JSON data from the specified file using `j_loads`.
2. Checks if the loaded data is valid. If not, logs a debug message and returns `None`.
3. Iterates through the loaded data.
4. Sets each data item as an attribute of the class instance using `setattr`.
5. Returns `True` if the loading process was successful.


## Functions

(No functions are defined in the provided code)


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  Stores the mode of operation (e.g., 'dev').


**Note**:  The provided code includes comments indicating that there is more implementation within the `__init__` and `_payload` methods, but no details are given about them.  The `...` are placeholders. Complete documentation would require further code details.
