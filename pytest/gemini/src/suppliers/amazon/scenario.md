**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to create a mock `Supplier` object. This is crucial for testing functions that depend on external resources (like drivers and locators) without actually interacting with them.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

3. **Assertions:**  Assertions are used to verify the expected outcomes (e.g., returning a list, handling empty lists, missing locators, etc.).

4. **Error Handling:** A test `test_get_list_products_in_category_error_during_execute_locator` demonstrates how to use `pytest.raises` to check for exceptions.  Crucially, it now includes an assertion to verify the error message.

5. **Fixture for Supplier:** The `supplier_mock` fixture makes the test setup more organized and reusable.

6. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for empty lists and missing locators.

7. **Completeness:** The code includes tests for multiple scenarios like valid input, empty list, missing locators, and error handling.

8. **Avoiding Unnecessary `continue`:** The original code had unnecessary `continue` statements that were removed.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Place the test code (above) in a file named `test_scenario.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `scenario.py` file.
3. Run `pytest test_scenario.py` from your terminal.


This improved solution provides more comprehensive and robust test coverage for your function, ensuring that it handles various scenarios correctly. Remember to adapt the locators and data in the tests to accurately reflect the actual implementation of `get_list_products_in_category`.  You can further extend the tests by incorporating more complex inputs and error scenarios.
