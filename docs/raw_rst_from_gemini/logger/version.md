    with open('settings.json', 'r') as settings_file:
        settings = json.load(settings_file)

    pass  # Important: Handle exceptions gracefully.  Don't crash.

__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez') if settings else 'hypotez'
__version__ = settings.get("version", '') if settings else ''
__doc__ = ''
__details__ = ''
__author__ = settings.get("author", '') if settings else ''
__copyright__ = settings.get("copyright", '') if settings else ''  # Corrected typo: copyrihgnt -> copyright
__cofee__ = settings.get("cofee", "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69") if settings else "Treat the developer to a cup of coffee for boosting enthusiasm in development: https://boosty.to/hypo69"
```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Exception Handling:** The `except` block now uses `pass` instead of `...`. This is crucial for robustness.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the script won't crash; it'll just use default values.  The `...` is a placeholder for *doing* something, often for code that might be added later, but without doing anything it's not helpful.
* **Typo Correction:** The `__copyright__` variable now correctly uses `copyright` instead of `copyrihgnt`.
* **PEP 8 Compliance (Style):**  Consistent with Python style guidelines, I've used `__version__` as a variable name. Python uses double underscores for special variable names like this to indicate they are not to be directly modified.


**How to Use (Example):**

```python
import logger.version

print(logger.version.__version__)
print(logger.version.__project_name__)

# ... other code that uses the variables ...
```


**Why `pass` is better than `...`:**

The `...` is a placeholder, typically for unfinished code.  It signals to other developers, "This part is not yet implemented." In this case, a missing `settings.json` is *not* a problem you want to leave as an unfinished bit of code. `pass` means "do nothing" in that case.  An empty `except` block doesn't do anything, and it's better practice to use explicit `pass` instead.



**Important Considerations:**

* **`settings.json` Structure:**  Ensure that `settings.json` has the correct structure if you want to use values from it. Example:

```json
{
  "project_name": "MyAwesomeProject",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, My Company",
  "cofee": "https://my-coffee-link.com"
}
```

* **Error Handling in a Production Environment:** In a production environment, you might want to log the `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` instead of just silently using defaults to help diagnose issues, for example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)  # Or a different level
try:
    # ... your code to load settings ...
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
    logging.warning(f"Error loading settings: {e}")
    # ... use default values ...
```


This revised answer provides a more robust and maintainable solution. Remember to place `settings.json` in the correct location relative to `version.py`.
