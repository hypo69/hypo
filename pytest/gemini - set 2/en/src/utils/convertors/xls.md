**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Dummy Data and File Creation:** The code now includes `dummy_xls_data` and `create_dummy_excel()` to create temporary Excel files for testing.  This is crucial, as you can't directly test against external files in a CI/CD pipeline or during automated tests.

2. **File Cleanup:** The `dummy_excel_file` fixture now correctly removes the temporary file after the test using `os.remove()`.  This prevents test failures from build-up of temporary files.

3. **Clearer Error Handling:** The `xls2dict` function now includes `try...except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions.  It's crucial to handle these exceptions correctly in your production code, and pytest's `pytest.raises` is used to verify that the correct exceptions are raised when the file is not found.

4. **`TypeError` Handling:** A `TypeError` is added to handle cases where the input might not be a file at all.

5. **`xls2dict` Function Definition:** The `xls2dict` function is now defined within the test file to allow testing. This is important so that you're not testing against code in a different file or an inaccessible module.

6. **`pytest.raises`:** The `test_xls2dict_invalid_file` test demonStartes the correct use of `pytest.raises` to assert that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised when the file doesn't exist.

7. **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided examples are basic; you'll need to expand on these tests significantly for thorough coverage based on your original `src.utils.xls` code.  The `test_xls2dict_invalid_file_type` demonStartes how to test invalid input types.


**How to use:**

1.  **Replace placeholders:** Update `from src.utils.xls import ...` with the correct import path and replace `dummy_xls_data` with actual test data loading from your `xls` file if possible.

2.  **Expand tests:** Add more tests covering various data formats, scenarios, and exception cases from your actual `xls` code.

3.  **Run tests:** Use `pytest` to run the tests.  For example, `pytest test_xls.py` (if you save the test code in a file named `test_xls.py`).


This improved solution is significantly more robust, handles exceptions correctly, and provides a starting point for writing comprehensive tests for your Excel conversion functions. Remember to tailor these tests to the specific functionalities of your `src.utils.xls` module. Remember to install pytest if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`
