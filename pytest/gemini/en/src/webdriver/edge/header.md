```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `open` function and `Path.exists`. This isolates the tests from the actual file system interactions, making them faster and more reliable.  Crucially, mocking `Path.exists` allows us to control whether a file is found.

* **Parameterization:** `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used for `test_settings_file_exists_and_load` and `test_README_file_exists_and_read`. This makes it easy to test both cases (file exists and file doesn't exist) in a single test function.

* **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more explicit about what is being checked (e.g., `assert isinstance(root_path, Path)`).

* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover cases where the marker files are not found, the files are in the same directory, and scenarios for `settings.json` and `README.MD` file existence or non-existence.

* **Exception Handling:** The test cases for file handling now include assertions to verify that exceptions are handled correctly (specifically `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`).

* **Fixture for mocking:**  The `mock_path_exists` fixture simplifies setting up the mocked behavior for the `Path.exists` method.

* **Example Data (commented out):**  I've commented out the example data for `example_data()` because there is no data in the original code that needs to be constructed.


This revised solution provides a much more robust and thorough set of tests for the given code. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest hypotez/src/webdriver/edge/test_header.py
```

(Replace `test_header.py` with the name of your test file if you rename it.) Remember to save the test cases in a file named `test_header.py` in the same directory as `header.py`. This will allow pytest to discover and run the test cases. Make sure your `test_header.py` is in the same directory with `hypotez` folder.
