**Explanation of Improvements and Why They Matter:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the script won't crash.  Instead, it prints a warning message and uses default values.  This is vital for robustness in a real-world application.  The previous version would have caused the entire program to fail.

2. **Clear Warning:** The `print` statement inside the `except` block gives valuable feedback to the developer about what happened.

3. **Corrected Typo:** Changed `"copyrihgnt"` to `"copyright"`. Typos in variable names can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

4. **Explicit Empty Strings:** The `__doc__`, `__details__`,  and other variables that are expected to hold strings are explicitly assigned empty strings (`''`). This prevents potential errors later in the code or documentation generation tools that might expect these variables to have meaningful values.

5. **PEP 8 Style:** Minor formatting adjustments for readability.


**How to Use This in a Larger Project**

This `version.py` file is designed to be imported into other modules in your project.  The variables (`__version__`, `__author__`, etc.) are then accessible for things like:

* **Versioning:** Displaying the version in user interfaces, documentation.
* **Author Attribution:** Including authorship information in help text.
* **Metadata:** Generating project metadata for various build systems.


**Example Usage (in another Python file):**

```python
import hypotez.src.db.version

print(hypotez.src.db.version.__version__)
print(hypotez.src.db.version.__author__)
```


By making these changes, the code becomes far more robust and less prone to unexpected errors.  The explicit error handling and default values make it suitable for integrating into a production environment. Remember to create a `settings.json` file with your project's settings.  A properly formatted `settings.json` is essential for this to work. For example:

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024 Your Company",
  "cofee": "Link to your Boosty page"
}
```
