```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Introduced `mock_supplier` and `mock_product_fields` fixtures to create and manage test data.  This isolates the tests and avoids unnecessary setup within each test function.
* **Clearer Assertions:** Replaced simple `print` statements in examples with assertions that directly verify the expected outcomes.  This is crucial for robust testing. For example, instead of `if result: print(...)`, we use `assert result is True` (or appropriate assertion for other outcomes).
* **Failure Cases:** Added crucial failure cases to `test_run_scenario_file` and `test_run_scenario_files`. This tests for files that don't exist (a common error) and also simulates a scenario where one of the files within a list might fail.
* **Error Handling:**  The code now checks for failures and reports them correctly using `assert`.
* **`@pytest.mark.asyncio`:** Added this decorator to the `test_execute_PrestaShop_insert_async_success` function to indicate that it's an asynchronous test. This allows `pytest` to handle the asynchronous execution correctly.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests now cover the main functions and methods for their different inputs and expected behaviors.
* **Realistic Scenarios:** The example data (e.g., `mock_product_fields`) provides a more realistic representation of the data used in the original code.


**Crucial Considerations for Further Improvement:**

* **Real Supplier Data:**  For real-world scenarios, you would need to use actual file paths and mocked APIs (e.g., to fetch URLs).
* **PrestaShop API Mocking:** Use a mocking library (like `unittest.mock`) to test interactions with the PrestaShop API without actually calling the external service, especially in `add_coupon` and `execute_PrestaShop_insert`.  This avoids dependency on external services and ensures isolation.
* **Specific Error Handling:** Your functions likely raise specific exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `APIError`). Tests should use `pytest.raises` to assert that these exceptions are handled correctly.
* **Edge Cases:** Your tests need to push the functions into more complex cases than provided in the example, to ensure that they can handle edge cases and non-trivial situations.
* **Dependency Management:** Explicitly install any required libraries.  


Remember to adjust the test cases and fixtures based on the actual functionality and error handling within the `executor` module.  This improved set of tests provides a good starting point for more thorough and comprehensive testing.
