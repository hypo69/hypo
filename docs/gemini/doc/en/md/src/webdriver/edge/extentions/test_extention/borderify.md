# borderify.js

## Overview

This JavaScript file modifies the border of a document's body element to a 5px red solid border, and displays an alert box.


## Functions

### `document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";`

**Description**: This line directly modifies the CSS style property of the `body` element.  It sets the border to 5 pixels wide, solid, and red.


### `alert()`

**Description**: This line displays a pop-up alert box.  It does not take any parameters and does not return a value.

**Raises**:

* `Error`:  While `alert` itself doesn't explicitly throw an error, any JavaScript exception arising in a prior function call could be propagated and lead to an error in the broader application.

**Note:**  This documentation only describes the *functionality* of the code snippets; it does not include any possible error handling or context of a larger application that might use these functions.
