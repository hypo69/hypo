**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `gs.path`:** The code now uses a `MockGsPath` fixture to mock the `gs.path` object.  This is *crucial* because the original code interacts with the filesystem (likely via `gs`).  Mocking allows testing without actually creating or modifying files on the real system.
* **Mocking PyQt6 GUI:** The `qtbot` fixture from `pytest-qt` is used.
* **Testing for File Existence:** Tests `add_context_menu_item` by checking if the dummy script file is created.  This verifies the logic within the function, and is a substitute for actual registry interaction, which pytest can't directly control.
* **Error Handling:** The tests now explicitly use `pytest.raises` to verify that the expected exceptions are raised when invalid inputs are provided.
* **Testing for File Existence in Remove:**  Since removing a key from the registry cannot be tested directly in `pytest` (due to the necessity to access windows registry), we create a dummy registry entry in a temporary directory and then verify that the entry is removed.
* **pytest main**: The code now includes a way to run the tests using `pytest.main([__file__])` (adapt this part to your project setup)


**Important Considerations (for a robust solution):**

* **`gs` module:**  The tests heavily rely on the `gs` module being correctly mocked or stubbed out. Provide a detailed mock for `gs.path` in a robust test environment.
* **Windows Registry:** Directly testing Windows Registry interactions is difficult from within `pytest`.  Mocking or simulating these interactions is often the best approach.
* **PyQt6 Application:** PyQt6 is tested, creating and handling the application. 

Remember to install `pytest`, `pytest-qt` (if you're using PyQt) and any other necessary libraries.  If `gs` is a significant part of the logic, a good mocking approach to `gs` would be needed.
