```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing imports: `json`, `j_loads`, `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson`, and `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` as requested.
- Added a placeholder function `some_function` with a docstring and basic error handling using `logger`.
- Included examples of using `j_loads` for loading JSON data and logging errors.
