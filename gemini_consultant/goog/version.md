```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Exception Handling:** The `except` block now uses `pass` instead of `...`.  This is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, the code won't crash.  Instead, it will continue running and use default values.  This is the proper way to handle file I/O exceptions in Python.

2. **Typo Correction:** The `__copyright__` key was misspelled as `__copyrihgnt__`. This is now corrected to `__copyright__`.

3. **PEP 8 Compliance (Minor):**  While not strictly necessary, using `__version__` (lowercase) as the variable name is more common for module version variables than using `__version__: str`.  This change helps to make the code more consistent with Python style guidelines.


**Why these changes are important:**

* **Robustness:**  The code is now more resilient to potential errors.  It won't crash if `settings.json` is unavailable or malformed.

* **Maintainability:**  Graceful handling of errors makes the code easier to maintain and debug.


**How to use this:**

You can use these variables in your other modules like this:


```python
import hypotez.src.goog.version as version

print(version.__version__)  # Assuming you have a version in settings.json
```

Remember to place your `settings.json` file in the correct location (`../settings.json`) relative to `version.py`.  If `settings.json` isn't found, the default values will be used.  For example, if `settings.json` looks like this:


```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe"
}
```

then `__version__` will be "1.2.3".


**Example `settings.json`** (showing the correct key names):


```json
{
  "project_name": "Hypotez",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024, Your Company",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/donate"
}
```
