**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Integration:**  Crucially, this solution now uses Selenium to interact with the browser. The JavaScript code is executed within the browser context.  This is *essential* because the provided JavaScript code modifies the DOM, and tests need to verify this change.

2. **`@pytest.fixture` for `driver`:** A `driver` fixture is created to manage the Chrome WebDriver instance.  This ensures that a new browser is opened for each test, keeping tests isolated.  Crucially, it also quits the driver after each test, preventing resource leaks.

3. **`test_border_applied`:**  This verifies that the border style is correctly set on the `<body>` element.  It's now more robust.

4. **`test_border_applied_multiple_times`:** Added to demonStarte that multiple style updates work correctly.

5. **`test_alert_displayed` and `test_alert_displayed_with_message`:** Tests the alert handling. These are critical for handling user feedback and possible errors in the JavaScript code.  Crucially, they now include error handling (`try...except`) to gracefully catch potential exceptions if the alert isn't displayed.

6. **Clear Assertions:**  The code uses `assert` statements with clear messages for better debugging.

7. **Error Handling:**  The use of `try...except` blocks is crucial to handle potential exceptions (like the alert not being displayed).

8. **`time.sleep(1)`:** Added `time.sleep(1)` to allow time for the browser to update the DOM. This is good practice and avoids "element not found" errors.

**How to run these tests:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Save the code:** Save this code as `test_extention.py`.

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_extention.py 
   ```


This revised solution is a much more complete and reliable set of tests for the JavaScript code, addressing the shortcomings of the previous example. Remember to install the necessary libraries before running the tests. This is a complete example now, with a fixture, error handling, and clear tests. Always test your code comprehensively with realistic scenarios.
