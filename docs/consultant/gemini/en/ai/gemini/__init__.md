# Placeholder for other AI suppliers if needed.

```

**Changes Made**:

- Added a module-level docstring in RST format explaining the purpose of the module.
- Moved the import statements to the top of the file for better readability and organization.
- Added a comment explaining the purpose of the `MODE` variable.
- Removed the unnecessary empty lines and commented-out lines.
- Improved the overall code formatting.

**Explanation of Changes**:

The original code was somewhat unstructured. The improved version adheres to RST formatting for comments and docstrings, making the code more readable and understandable.  The import statements are now grouped logically, enhancing code organization. The docstring now clearly defines the module's purpose. This revised version follows best practices for Python code style and documentation.

**Further Considerations**:

* **Error Handling:** While the code doesn't contain explicit calculations or data processing,  consider adding `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions, such as `ImportError` if a module isn't available.

* **Testing:**  For production-quality code, consider writing unit tests (using `pytest` or a similar framework) to verify the functionality and correctness of the code.

* **Configuration:** If `MODE` is dynamically determined from configuration files, be sure to document the configuration process clearly.

* **Comments:** Comments can be added explaining the purpose of the `MODE` variable and what values it might take, and any possible implications of this variable.
