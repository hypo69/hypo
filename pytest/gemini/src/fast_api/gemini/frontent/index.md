```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the HTML file.  Therefore, no tests are possible.
# pytest cannot execute HTML files directly.  You need to test Python code,
# not HTML. If you have Python code that renders or interacts with this HTML,
# provide that code and I can write tests.

# Example if there were some python code that renders this HTML:
# (This is just an example, replace with your actual code)
# def render_html(some_data):
#     # ... code to render the html based on the data ...
#     return """<html><body>...your html content with data from some_data... </body></html>"""

# Example Test (assuming a function that generates HTML)
# @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_data, expected_html", [
#     ({"name": "Alice"}, "<html><body><h1>Hello Alice</h1></body></html>"),
#     ({"name": "Bob"}, "<html><body><h1>Hello Bob</h1></body></html>"),
# ])
# def test_render_html(test_data, expected_html):
#     actual_html = render_html(test_data)
#     assert actual_html == expected_html

```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file `index.html` is a static web page.  There is no Python code to test.  Pytest is a testing framework for Python code.  To write effective tests, you need Python functions or classes that this HTML interacts with (e.g., a Flask or FastAPI route that renders this HTML, JavaScript code that interacts with an API).

**How to Write Tests if you had Python Code:**

1. **Isolate the Code:**  If you have Python functions or classes that interact with this HTML (e.g., generate the HTML content dynamically or handle user input), extract them into a separate Python file.
2. **Create Tests:**  Use `pytest` to test these isolated Python functions. Your tests would validate the correct rendering of HTML components, handling of inputs, and correctness of the output.


**Example (IlluStartive):**

```python
# example_file.py (hypothetical code)
def generate_greeting_html(name):
    if not isinstance(name, str):
        raise TypeError("Name must be a string")
    return f"""<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>...</head>
<body><h1>Hello {name}!</h1></body>
</html>"""
```

```python
# test_example_file.py
import pytest
from example_file import generate_greeting_html

def test_generate_greeting_html_valid_input():
    html = generate_greeting_html("Alice")
    assert "<h1>Hello Alice!</h1>" in html

def test_generate_greeting_html_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        generate_greeting_html(123)  # Test for an integer input

```

Without Python code, no tests can be written.  Please provide the relevant Python code that interacts with or uses this HTML file, and I can generate appropriate test cases.
