How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a constant variable named `MODE` and sets its value to 'dev'.  The code also contains several multi-line strings (docstrings) that describe the module, but these do not affect the primary function of setting the `MODE` variable.  Essentially, this file configures a development mode for a PrestaShop endpoint.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code block initializes a variable named `MODE` to the string value `'dev'`.
2. Several docstrings are included to document the module's purpose, platform compatibility, and other details but do not directly affect the running or usage of the code outside of documentation purposes.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Import the module (if needed for accessing the MODE variable).
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.domains.emildesign_com import MODE

    # Access and print the value of MODE.
    print(MODE)  # Output: dev
