**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Uses `pytest.fixture` for creating dummy project structures (`dummy_project`), which is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding side effects. This significantly improves test reliability.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, missing marker files, marker files not found, and cases where the project root is already in `sys.path`.
* **Error Handling:** Tests now correctly handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during settings and docstring loading. Tests the case when either file is missing.
* **Edge Cases:** Tests include a case where the marker file exists in the current directory to test the handling.
* **`pytest.raises` (NOT NEEDED HERE):**  Exception handling is now tested through assertions on the return values rather than `pytest.raises`, making it more straightforward and readable in this particular scenario.
* **Import Handling:** The code now properly imports `settings` and `doc_str` from the `header` module to test their values directly.
* **`sys.path` Handling:** Added a test to ensure the correct handling of the case when the path is already present in `sys.path`.

This revised solution provides a more robust and comprehensive test suite for the `set_project_root` function and the settings and docstring loading. Remember to adapt the test files to correctly reference the imported module names from your actual code. Also, adjust the assertions to precisely match the expected outputs of the functions.

To run the tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, run the tests from the command line:

```bash
pytest -v
```
