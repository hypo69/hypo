**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now accurately describe the test case.
* **Fixtures:** A `chrome_driver` fixture is introduced to set up a WebDriver instance and navigate to a test page. This is *essential* for running tests in an isolated, controlled environment, as otherwise the browser might be in an unexpected state from previous tests.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The `test_find_element_not_found` and `test_get_attribute_by_locator_nonexistent_element` demonstrate how to use `pytest.raises` to check for specific exceptions (`NoSuchElementException` and similar), making your tests more reliable.
* **Realistic Test Cases:** Tests now cover `get_url` with both valid and invalid URLs, and `find_element` with a check for an element that *should not* be found.
* **Example Locator:** An example `test_execute_locator_valid_locator`  shows how to use your `execute_locator` method with placeholder data.  Crucially, you *must* replace the placeholder data (e.g., the CSS selector `"h1"`) with an actual valid locator to ensure your test is relevant to your code.


**How to run:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Make sure you have a working Selenium WebDriver:**
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

3.  **Replace Placeholders:** Modify the placeholder values (like the example.com URL and the CSS selector `"h1"`) in the test functions to match the actual URLs and locators you want to test in your application.

4.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```


**Very Important:**

* **Real Test Data:** The `test_get_url_invalid` and other test cases need realistic data to be effective.  You'll need to get a web page with example elements and correct locators for the tests to be useful.
* **Avoid Running Tests on Live Websites (In a CI/CD Pipeline):**  Testing against live websites is very unreliable, especially in a CI/CD setting.  Ensure your tests are running against a reliable, local environment.
* **WebDriver Initialization:**  Properly initializing the WebDriver (`Driver(Chrome)`) in a fixture ensures isolation and avoids potential issues between tests.
