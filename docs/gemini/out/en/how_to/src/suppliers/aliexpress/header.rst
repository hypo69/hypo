How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a function `set_project_root` that determines the root directory of a project. It searches upwards from the current script's location for directories containing specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`). It then adds the root directory to the Python path (`sys.path`) if it's not already present.  The code also loads settings from a JSON file named `settings.json` located in the project's `src` directory, handling potential errors like the file not being found or invalid JSON data.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `Version` from `packaging`, and `Path` from `pathlib`.


2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names as input.

3. **Find project root:**
   - It starts from the directory containing the current script (`__file__`).
   - It iterates through parent directories of the current directory.
   - It checks if any of the specified marker files exists in each parent directory.
   - If a directory with marker files is found, it sets the `__root__` variable to that directory and exits the loop.

4. **Add root to sys.path:** If the found root directory is not already in `sys.path`, it adds it to the beginning of the list.

5. **Return root:** Returns the determined `__root__` path.

6. **Get Project Root:** Calls the `set_project_root` function to determine the project root directory, storing the result in the `__root__` variable.

7. **Load settings:**
    - It tries to open the `settings.json` file in the project's `src` directory.
    - It loads the JSON data from the file into the `settings` variable using `json.load`.
    - It handles potential errors like `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` if the file is not found or the JSON is invalid.  This avoids the script crashing.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.header import set_project_root

    # Create example project structure (for testing)
    project_root = Path("./myproject")
    project_root.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    (project_root / "src").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    (project_root / "src" / "settings.json").write_text('{"setting1": "value1"}')
    (project_root / "pyproject.toml").touch()


    # Change current working directory to the project root
    os.chdir(project_root)

    # Call the function
    project_root_path = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root_path}")

    # Verify that the path is correct
    assert project_root == project_root_path

    # Verify that sys.path contains the project root
    assert str(project_root) in sys.path
