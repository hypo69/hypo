**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `sys.path`:** The code now mocks `sys.path`. This is absolutely essential.  Directly using `os.getcwd()` and manipulating the file system would introduce dependencies and lead to unreliable tests that might fail because of other processes.

2. **`mock_sys_path` and `unmock_sys_path`:**  These functions wrap the path modification and reset to prevent side effects in your test cases.

3. **Error Handling and Robustness:** `test_path_construction_no_hypotez` shows how to test edge cases, like when 'hypotez' isn't found. The `try-except` block in `test_path_construction` handles potential `IndexError` gracefully, preventing the test from crashing.

4. **Clearer Test Names:** The test names (e.g., `test_path_construction_no_hypotez`) are more descriptive, improving readability and understanding.

5. **Dummy Imports:** `stub_module_imports` creates dummy classes and modules to replace actual imports. This is crucial; otherwise, tests won't run because they can't import the missing modules.  You'll need to adapt this to match the actual modules and classes in your project.

6. **File Handling (example):** The `test_print_dir_root` example demonStartes mocking file system interactions. **Crucially,** it removes the temporary test file at the end to avoid clutter.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3.  Replace the placeholder `# ...` with the real imports and their equivalent mock versions.
4.  Run `pytest test_header.py`.

This significantly improves the testability and reliability of your tests by isolating them from the underlying file system.  Remember to adjust the dummy classes in `stub_module_imports` according to your actual code. Add tests for other functions/methods in a similar, isolated manner.
