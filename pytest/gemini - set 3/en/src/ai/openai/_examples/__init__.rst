**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Assertions:** The tests now use more descriptive assertions (e.g., `assert isinstance(__details__, dict)`) to clearly state what's being verified.  This makes the tests easier to understand and debug.

2. **Explicit Error Handling:** The `test_version_is_valid_format` test now correctly uses `pytest.fail` to give a meaningful error message if the version format is invalid.  This is crucial for robust error handling.

3. **Edge Case and Type Checking:** The `test_details_contains_specific_key` example demonStartes how to check if a dictionary contains specific keys and their types.  Adapting this to your specific `__details__` structure is essential.


4. **Example for Exception Handling:**  The `test_function_does_not_raise_exception_with_valid_input` function demonStartes how to test for exceptions (and how to replace with your actual code).

5. **Flexibility:** The comments are now placeholders for you to replace with your actual functions, expected results, and the specific details of `__details__` if it's more complex.  You must add tests for those functions!

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Update the placeholder comments with the actual function calls, expected outputs, and details about the structure of `__details__` (e.g., expected keys and types).


2. **Add Tests for Other Functions:** If your file has other functions (which is likely), write separate test functions to cover them using similar logic.  Make sure to handle various cases (valid/invalid inputs, edge cases) appropriately.

3. **Run Tests:**  Save this code in a file named `test_examples.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/ai/openai/_examples/__init__.py`.  Then run pytest from your terminal:

   ```bash
   pytest test_examples.py
   ```


This revised solution provides a much more complete and robust testing framework for the provided code snippet.  Remember to adapt the specific tests to the actual structure of the code you're testing. Remember to install the `pytest` library if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
