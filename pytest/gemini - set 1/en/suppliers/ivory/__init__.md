```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory import MODE
from hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.graber import Graber


def test_mode_is_development():
    """Tests that the MODE constant is set to 'development'."""
    assert MODE == 'development', f"Expected MODE to be 'development', but got '{MODE}'"


def test_graber_class_exists():
    """Tests that the Graber class exists in the module."""
    assert Graber is not None, "Graber class not found."

# Example of a test with a fixture (if the 'Graber' class had methods needing setup).

# @pytest.fixture
# def graber_instance():
#     """Returns a Graber object for testing."""
#     return Graber()


# def test_graber_method_example(graber_instance):
#     """Tests a method of the Graber class (example)."""
#     # Replace with the actual method call and assertions.
#     # Example:
#     # result = graber_instance.some_method()
#     # assert result == expected_result
#     pass  # Replace with actual test logic


# Additional tests could be added depending on the functionality of the Graber class
# (e.g., to test for specific exceptions, edge cases, or constructors)
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  The test names (`test_mode_is_development`, `test_graber_class_exists`) clearly indicate the purpose of each test.

2. **Assertion:** The `test_mode_is_development` test now uses an assertion to verify that `MODE` is equal to 'development'. This is a much more robust way to check for the expected value.

3. **Class Existence Check:** The `test_graber_class_exists` test verifies that the `Graber` class is actually defined in the module. This is crucial for ensuring that the module is imported correctly and that the expected class is present.

4. **Fixtures (Example):**  The commented-out `graber_instance` fixture and `test_graber_method_example` show how to create a fixture to set up a `Graber` instance if needed for testing methods.  Crucially, this is an example *only*; if there's no relevant class method to test, the commented-out code is not necessary.

5. **Thoroughness:**  The tests are now very basic.  To make them more comprehensive, you would need to understand what the `Graber` class *does* and what its methods are. This example only demonStartes basic `pytest` usage to ensure the module structure exists.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_ivory_supplier.py`).
2.  Make sure `pytest` is installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run `pytest test_ivory_supplier.py` from your terminal.


**Important Considerations for Real-World Testing:**

* **`Graber` Class Methods:**  If the `Graber` class has methods that take arguments or return values, add tests for different input scenarios, including:
    * Valid inputs (various types, etc.)
    * Invalid or unexpected inputs, causing expected exceptions
    * Edge cases (e.g., empty lists, large numbers)
* **Dependencies:**  If the `Graber` class depends on other external libraries or resources, consider using mocks to isolate the tests and prevent relying on external systems.
* **Data-Driven Tests:**  If the `Graber` class processes data, use data-driven tests to test different types of data and ensure proper handling in diverse situations.


**Example Tests with Mock (if Graber depends on external resources):**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

# ... (other imports)

# ... (other tests)


# Example of using a Mock for an external resource (e.g., an API call)
@pytest.fixture
def mock_external_resource():
    mock_resource = MagicMock()
    mock_resource.get.return_value = {'data': 'some_data'}  # Example response
    return mock_resource


def test_graber_uses_external_resource(mock_external_resource, graber_instance):
    graber_instance.external_resource = mock_external_resource  # Injected Mock
    result = graber_instance.process_data()
    # Assertions based on expected behavior when using the external resource
    # ... (e.g., checking if the external resource's .get method was called)
    assert mock_external_resource.get.called
    assert result == 'processed_data'  # Example

```
