```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import necessary modules:**  Crucially imports `pytest` and `pathlib`.
2. **Sample Data:** Created a `sample_data` dictionary for testing `read_xls_as_dict`.  **Crucial:** Replace the dummy `sample_data` with actual data reflecting the structure expected by your `read_xls_as_dict` function.
3. **`sample_xls_file` Fixture:** This fixture now correctly creates a temporary xlsx file using `tmp_path` from `pytest`. This is *essential* for avoiding conflicts and ensuring that tests don't interfere with each other.
4. **`xls2dict` wrapper:** The wrapper function, `xls2dict`, encapsulates the logic of calling `read_xls_as_dict` to make testing simpler.
5. **Robustness:** Added tests for `test_xls2dict_invalid_file`, `test_xls2dict_not_xlsx`, and `test_xls2dict_empty_file` â€“ critical for real-world scenarios. The tests now correctly check for the return value `None` in case of failure.
6. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** Added a basic example (`test_save_xls_file_invalid_data`) showing how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions (e.g., `TypeError`).  You need to adapt this based on the exceptions that your code raises.
7. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Improved docstrings for better understanding of the test's purpose.
8. **File Handling:** The code now uses a temporary file in the tests (`TEST_FILE_NAME`) for safe and independent testing, and the `tmp_path` from `pytest`.

**Critical Next Steps:**

* **Replace the placeholder comments** in the `test_xls2dict_valid_input` and `test_save_xls_file_valid_input` with appropriate assertions based on the expected output of your functions.   What is the return value of `read_xls_as_dict`?  How will you verify it?
* **More specific edge cases:** Add tests for different file formats, empty sheets, missing columns, and other edge scenarios that your function might encounter.
* **Data-driven testing:** If possible, use data-driven tests to test with various inputs more efficiently.


This revised solution provides a solid foundation for testing your code.  Crucially, **you must replace the placeholder comments with appropriate assertions** based on the expected return values and behaviors of your functions. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific structure and function of your `src.utils.xls` code.
