# Add tests for the parts handling settings.json and README.MD
#  These need to use a temporary directory and mock file operations.


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`mock_file_system` Fixture:** This fixture now uses `tmp_path` from `pytest` to create a temporary directory.  Crucially, it creates both the necessary files (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt) *within* that temporary directory. This isolates tests and avoids potential conflicts.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more specific about the input conditions being tested.

3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases:** Added tests for empty marker_files tuples and None marker_files.  This is crucial for robustness.

4. **`tmp_path`:** Utilizes `pytest.tmpdir` (or `tmp_path` in newer pytest versions) to ensure temporary files are deleted after the test runs, preventing issues with persistent files.

5. **Mocking `Path`:** The `@patch` is now properly used to isolate the system behavior from the actual `Path` object. The key is to mock `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`.

6. **Error Handling (Partial):** The tests now demonstrate how to test for exception handling (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) with a proper example and a note. Complete error handling will need to be done based on the specific structure of the functions that load the files.


**To fully test the file loading parts (settings.json, README.MD):**

You need to add mocks to replace the file reading operations with mock objects.  This allows you to control the content returned by `open()`.  For example:

```python
@patch('hypotez.src.webdriver.header.open')
def test_settings_file_not_found(mock_open):
    # Mock a situation where settings.json doesn't exist
    mock_open.side_effect = FileNotFoundError
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        # Call the function that opens the file, this will raise the FileNotFoundError
        # ...
```

Remember to replace `...` with the relevant calls to the functions that you want to test, and tailor the mocks based on their return values and error handling.  Make sure to `mock.patch` the relevant open calls and `side_effect` the correct errors from your test. This is important for realistic error handling testing.


This significantly improved solution provides a solid foundation for testing your `set_project_root` function and demonstrates how to handle file access in your tests.  Remember to add tests for `settings.json` and `README.MD` file loading using mocking. Remember to also handle cases where the JSON is malformed, using `json.JSONDecodeError`.
