**Note:** The docstrings in the input code are incomplete and do not provide sufficient information for detailed documentation of the expected parameters, return values, or exceptions.  The module `header` is also not defined, thus the structure of documentation is based on the provided code.  To generate complete and accurate documentation, additional context (the complete code for the module `header` and the class `SpreadSheet`) is needed.
