**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exceptions:**  Crucially, the code now uses `pytest.raises` to test for `ValueError` or other exceptions that might be raised in the `Edge` class, validating the exception handling. This is essential for robustness.

2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the purpose, e.g., `test_edge_initialization_invalid_url`.

3. **Mock WebDriver:** The `test_edge_get_webdriver` test now uses a `mock_webdriver` fixture (correctly added). This is critical because interacting with a real browser in tests can be slow and unstable.

4. **Mocking and Fixtures:**  I've included a `mock_webdriver` fixture to mock the WebDriver object. This prevents your tests from actually launching a browser, which would make them much slower and less reliable.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The tests cover initialization (valid and invalid cases), `set_mode`, and the crucial case where the `get_webdriver` function would return a driver instance.

6. **Edge Cases:** Includes tests for invalid URL, and missing or invalid options.  This demonStartes the important principle of considering boundary and unexpected input conditions.

**To run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save this code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_edge.py`).
3. Put your `hypotez/src/webdriver/edge.py` file in the same directory.
4. Run `pytest test_edge.py`.

Remember to replace `"some_url"`, `"some_options"` and the placeholder class with the actual arguments and expected behavior of your `Edge` class.  If `Edge` class has additional methods or attributes, be sure to add test functions covering those as well. Also, adapt the error messages in the exceptions to match the specific errors expected.
