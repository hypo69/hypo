**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Selenium Integration:** The Javascript code needs to be executed within a browser context.  The provided Javascript code won't work directly in a Python environment.  The solution now utilizes Selenium to drive a Firefox browser, execute the Javascript, and then assert the result of changing the border style.

2. **`driver_setup` Fixture:**  Crucially, a `driver_setup` fixture manages the creation and cleanup of the Firefox driver, which is essential for proper testing and avoids leaving browser windows open after each test run.

3. **Explicit Waits (Important):** Instead of implicit waits, use `WebDriverWait` to check if the alert is present.  This prevents the test from failing randomly.  Replace `driver.switch_to.alert` with appropriate handling of alert acceptance or dismissal based on your requirements.


4. **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions (like `TimeoutException` if the alert is not found). This improves robustness.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest selenium webdriver-manager
    ```
2.  Install geckodriver:
    ```bash
    pip install webdriver-manager
    #or
    # (Use the appropriate command for your system to download geckodriver.)
    ```
3.  Run the tests:
    ```bash
    pytest your_test_file.py
    ```

Remember to replace `"about:blank"` with the appropriate URL if the Javascript code should be executed on a different webpage. This revised solution demonstrates a complete example that directly addresses the challenges of running Javascript code within a testing context.
