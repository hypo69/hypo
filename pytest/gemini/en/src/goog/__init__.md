#Important:
# 1. Replace placeholders (e.g., "sample_spreadsheet.csv", "empty_spreadsheet.csv", error messages) with appropriate paths and expected results from your actual implementation.
# 2. Add more specific tests for the different functions and methods in your `SpreadSheet` class. Make sure to create dummy test files and data to support these tests.

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now better describe the purpose (e.g., `test_spreadsheet_read_data_empty_file`).

2. **Error Handling (Crucial):**  `pytest.raises` is used to test for `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError` (example).  This is essential to verify exception handling.  **Replace the placeholder error messages with the exact exceptions your `SpreadSheet` class should raise.**

3. **Edge Cases:** Added tests for empty files and invalid file formats to cover edge cases.

4. **Valid Input Tests:**  Added a `test_spreadsheet_read_data_valid_input` example.  **Replace the placeholder file and assertion** with your actual spreadsheet and expected data.

5. **Fixtures (Example):**  A `sample_data` fixture is provided as an example; use fixtures if you have reusable test data or setups.

6. **Placeholder Comments:** Replace the comments containing "...".  The tests currently don't verify any actual functionality because the `SpreadSheet` class and its methods are unknown.  Your tests must directly interact with those methods to validate their logic.

7. **File Existence:** Your tests now need sample test files (e.g., `sample_spreadsheet.csv`, `empty_spreadsheet.csv`, `invalid_format.txt`, etc.) created for testing.  The file names should match the paths used in your tests.  This is critical to ensuring the tests run.

8. **Verification (Assertions):**  Tests need to assert values obtained from your methods, such as checking the file contents or the format of the read/write data.  Add appropriate assertions according to your implementation.

9. **Import:** The `pytest` library is imported correctly.

10. **Complete `SpreadSheet` Test Suite:** You need to write additional tests covering all functions and possible scenarios in the `SpreadSheet` class.  This example only shows a few simple examples.

**Before running these tests:**

* **Implement the `SpreadSheet` class:**  You need a concrete implementation for the `SpreadSheet` class and its methods like `read_data` and `write_data`.
* **Create the test files:**  Create the test files (sample, empty, invalid) that your tests reference.
* **Run pytest:**  Make sure to run `pytest` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file and your `hypotez/src/goog` module.


Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual code. This comprehensive example provides a good structure and methodology for writing robust `pytest` tests.
