# src.ai.openai.model

## Overview

This module provides a basic structure for interacting with OpenAI models within the Hypotez application.  It currently defines the `OpenAIModel` class from the `training` submodule, likely for training purposes.


## Classes

### `OpenAIModel`

**Description**: This class likely represents an OpenAI model, possibly with functionalities for training or other related operations.


## Functions

_(None defined in the provided code)_


## Modules

### `src.ai.openai.model.training`

**Description**:  This submodule contains the `OpenAIModel` class implementation.  Further documentation should exist within this module's file.


## Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**:  A string variable containing the mode of operation, likely set to 'dev'.  This would impact any operational logic within the module.


## Usage


```python
# Example usage (requires further implementation details of OpenAIModel)
# from src.ai.openai.model import OpenAIModel
# model = OpenAIModel() 
# # ... further calls to model methods
```

**Note**:  The provided code snippet is very basic.  To generate more comprehensive documentation, the actual implementations of the `OpenAIModel` class and any functions within `src.ai.openai.model.training`  need to be included.
