**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Code to Test:** The provided input is a question/answer pair, not a Python function.  I've created a hypothetical `some_function` to demonstrate how to write tests.  **Replace this placeholder with the actual Python function from your `input_code`**.

2. **Hypothetical Function:** The tests assume `some_function` takes the config file name (a string) and returns a string indicating success or raises an exception for invalid inputs.  Adjust the tests to match the actual parameters and return values of your function.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test names (`test_some_function_valid_config_file`, etc.) clearly describe the purpose of each test.

4. **`pytest.raises`:**  The `test_some_function_invalid_file_name` demonstrates how to assert that an expected exception is raised, which is crucial for testing error handling.

5. **Edge Cases:** The tests cover a `None` and empty string input as potential edge cases for `config_file_name`.  Also check for non-string inputs.


6. **Replace with Your Code:**  Adapt the tests to thoroughly cover the logic of your actual functions, handling different input cases as you determine appropriate from the functions you wish to test.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_questions.py`) in the same directory as your Python code.
2.  Run `pytest test_questions.py` in your terminal to execute the tests.

**Crucially:** You need to provide the Python code (`input_code`) that defines the functions you want tested!  Without that, I cannot create relevant and accurate test cases.
