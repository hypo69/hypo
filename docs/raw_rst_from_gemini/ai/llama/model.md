Module: hypotez/src/ai/llama/model.py

This module contains the implementation of the Llama model.  It likely defines
the loading, initialization, and potentially the usage of the Llama large language
model (LLM).  Further details regarding the model architecture, specific
parameters, and interactions with the LLM are expected to be found within the
module's functions and classes.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to explain the purpose of the module and the functions.  This is crucial for maintainability and understanding.
* **Error Handling:** Included `try...except` blocks in the example functions to catch potential errors during model loading and generation, preventing the script from crashing and providing informative error messages.
* **Placeholder Implementation:** Replaced placeholder comments with informative error messages and `NotImplementedError` to indicate that the functionality is not yet fully implemented.
* **Example Usage:** Added an example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block showcasing how to call the functions and use the loaded model (though this still needs to be adapted to your specific use case).
* **Clear Function Definitions:** Defined `load_llama_model` and `generate_text` functions to encapsulate the model loading and generation logic.
* **Type Hinting (Optional):** For production code, consider adding type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.

**To use this module:**

1.  Replace `"path/to/your/llama/model"` with the actual path to your Llama model.
2.  Install the necessary libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `llama-cpp`).
3.  Implement the actual model loading and generation logic within the `load_llama_model` and `generate_text` functions using the correct libraries and APIs.
4.  Adapt the example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to your application's needs.

This improved version provides a more robust and understandable foundation for your Llama model module. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your specific code for model loading and generation. Remember to handle the expected output and error handling of the Llama library you are using.
