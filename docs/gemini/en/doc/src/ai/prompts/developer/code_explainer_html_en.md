# Code Explainer Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of a Python code snippet, focusing on its functionality, algorithm, and relationships with other parts of the project.  It adheres to a specified format, including detailed explanations of imports, classes, functions, variables, and potential areas for improvement.


## Code Snippet

```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Args:
        a (number): The first number to add.
        b (number): The second number to add.

    Returns:
        number: The sum of a and b.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If input a or b are not numbers.
    """
    try:
        result = calculate_sum(a, b)
        return result
    except TypeError as ex:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid input types: a={type(a)}, b={type(b)}") from ex

```


## Algorithm

1. **Import `calculate_sum`:** The function `calculate_sum` is imported from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
2. **Define `add_numbers`:** A function `add_numbers` is defined that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
3. **Calculate the sum:** Inside the function, `calculate_sum(a, b)` is called to calculate the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. **Return the result:** The calculated sum `result` is returned.
5. **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block is used to catch potential `TypeError` exceptions during the `calculate_sum` call.  This error handling ensures that appropriate error messages are returned if non-numeric input is provided.

**Example:**

Input: `a = 3`, `b = 5`

Algorithm: `calculate_sum(3, 5)`

Output: `8`


## Explanation

**Imports:**

- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: This line imports the function `calculate_sum` from the `src.utils.calculator` module. This suggests a modular design where the `calculator` module contains functions for various calculations.  The `src` prefix implies this code likely resides within a larger project structure.


**Function `add_numbers`:**

- **Purpose:** This function adds two numbers together, delegating the actual calculation to the `calculate_sum` function.
- **Arguments:**
    - `a` (number): The first number to be added.
    - `b` (number): The second number to be added.
- **Return Value:** The sum of `a` and `b`.
- **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block gracefully handles cases where either `a` or `b` is not a number, raising a `TypeError` with a more informative message about the specific invalid input types.

**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

- The `add_numbers` function relies on the `calculate_sum` function for the core addition logic.
- The existence of `src.utils.calculator` implies a broader project structure organizing utilities.

**Potential Improvements:**

- **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints (e.g., `a: int`, `b: int`) would improve code clarity and allow for static analysis tools to catch potential type errors.
- **Input Validation:** While the code handles potential type errors, it might be useful to add checks for `None` or other unexpected input. For example, if `calculate_sum` expects numbers, checking if `a` and `b` are numeric is still necessary.


## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates a function for adding numbers. The use of error handling and a clear design promotes robustness and maintainability, particularly if the `calculate_sum` function also deals with possible errors.  The well-structured approach enhances readability and makes the code easier to maintain within a larger project.
