# hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/header.py

## Overview

This module defines functions for setting the project root directory and loading project settings from a JSON file.  It utilizes the `gs` module for file path management and handles potential errors during file reading. The module also attempts to load a README.md file for documentation purposes, and defines several variables to store project details such as name, version, documentation string, author, and copyright information.

## Functions

### `set_project_root`

**Description**: Finds the root directory of the project starting from the current file's directory, searching upwards.

**Parameters**:
- `marker_files` (tuple): Filenames or directory names to identify the project root (default: `('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', '.git')`).

**Returns**:
- `Path`: Path to the root directory if found, otherwise the directory where the script is located.

**Raises**:
- None


### Variables

**Description**: Defines several variables that store project details (name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and coffee link).


## Variables


**Description**: The module defines several variables containing project information, potentially loaded from a `settings.json` file.


**Variables**:
- `__root__`: Path to the project root.
- `settings`: Dictionary containing project settings (loaded from `settings.json`).  Defaults to `None` if the file doesn't exist or is invalid JSON.
- `doc_str`: String containing the contents of the `README.md` file, defaults to `None`.
- `__project_name__`: The project name (from `settings.json`, defaulting to 'hypotez').
- `__version__`: The project version (from `settings.json`, defaulting to '').
- `__doc__`: The project documentation (from `README.MD`, defaulting to '').
- `__details__`:  An empty string.
- `__author__`: The author (from `settings.json`, defaulting to '').
- `__copyright__`: The copyright information (from `settings.json`, defaulting to '').
- `__cofee__`: The developer's coffee link (from `settings.json`, defaulting to a specified link).

**Note**: The loading of settings and documentation uses a `try-except` block to handle potential errors (such as `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`) during file reading and parsing.  These exceptions are not explicitly raised within the function definitions.
