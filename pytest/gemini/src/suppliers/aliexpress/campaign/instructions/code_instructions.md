**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now uses mock functions (`create_directories`, `save_config`, etc.) instead of relying on external files or actual directory operations.  This makes the tests much faster and more reliable, as they don't depend on the file system.


2. **Error Handling:** A test (`test_create_campaign_no_categories`) is added to demonstrate how to test for expected exceptions.


3. **Clearer Tests:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.


4. **Fixture (Potential):**  While not absolutely necessary for this example, you *could* use a fixture to provide the `campaign_name` and `language` values consistently across several tests. But in this example, the tests are fairly small and independent, so it's not essential.



5. **Robustness:** The tests now include more robust error checking (e.g., `test_edit_campaign_missing_config`) which was missing in the original.


6. **File Handling:**  The mock functions now correctly handle saving to files and are consistent.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_campaign.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_campaign.py`

This revised solution is more complete and better demonstrates how to write comprehensive `pytest` tests for the given code, particularly considering error handling and file interactions. Remember to replace the mock functions with your actual implementations if available.
