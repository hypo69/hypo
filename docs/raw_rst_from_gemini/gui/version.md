    # Consider using a default settings dictionary here instead of relying on None.
    settings = {}  # Or a predefined default

__project_name__ = settings.get("project_name", 'hypotez')

```

**Explanation of Improvements and why they are important:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` and prints a warning message.  This is crucial.  If `settings.json` is missing or corrupted, your script won't crash silently.  It will provide feedback to the user.  Crucially, it now handles the error by assigning an empty dictionary to `settings`. This is much better than letting `settings` be `None` because it prevents `AttributeError` exceptions later on when you try to use `settings.get()`.

2. **Default Settings:** The most significant change is the addition of `settings = {}` *inside* the `except` block. This provides a critical safeguard.  If `settings.json` is missing or invalid, the script will still run, and variables like `__project_name__` etc., will have sensible default values. This prevents unexpected errors and makes the code more robust.


3. **Typo Correction:**  The typo in `__copyright__` was corrected.


**Why these changes are better practice:**

* **Robustness:** The error handling makes the code much more resilient to file issues.
* **Maintainability:**  It's easier to read and debug when errors are handled gracefully.
* **Predictability:** The use of a default dictionary prevents `NoneType` errors.
* **Clarity:** The warning message helps in understanding any problems with `settings.json` and allows for quicker resolution.


**Example `settings.json` (for testing):**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "Copyright 2024",
  "cofee": "https://example.com/coffee"
}
```

By making these changes, your code is more reliable and user-friendly. Remember to adjust the default `__cofee__` URL if you have a different one in mind. Remember to test your code with a missing or corrupted `settings.json` file to verify that the error handling is working as expected.
