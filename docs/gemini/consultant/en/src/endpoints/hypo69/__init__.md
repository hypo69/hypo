## Changes Made

- Added missing imports `os`, `sys` and `src.utils.jjson`, `src.logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`.
- Added `run_endpoint` function for better organization.
- Wrapped the main section of the code within a `try-except` block to gracefully handle potential errors.
- Added error logging with `logger.error`.
- Added RST-style docstrings for the module, `get_mode` and `run_endpoint` functions, adhering to Sphinx standards.
- Added a placeholder comment `# ... (potential imports here)` and `# ... (Endpoint logic to be implemented)` to indicate where further code is needed for the function.
- Added a docstring to the `MODE` variable.
- Moved `MODE` declaration inside the file.
- Added `if __name__ == '__main__':` block for a cleaner entry point.
- Added `-> str` and `-> None` type hints to `get_mode` and `run_endpoint`.
- Ensured consistent use of single quotes.
- Added missing comments using `#` for parts that might require modification or are not yet implemented.
