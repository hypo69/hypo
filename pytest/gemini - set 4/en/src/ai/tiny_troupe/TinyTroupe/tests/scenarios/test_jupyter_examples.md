```

**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes comprehensive `try...except` blocks to catch various potential errors during notebook reading, kernel execution, and file saving. This makes the tests much more robust.  Crucially, it now distinguishes between invalid notebook format issues and kernel execution errors.  This is crucial for debugging and meaningful failure messages.
* **Missing File Check:** A check is added to skip the test if the notebook file `notebook_path` doesn't exist.
* **Invalid Notebook Format Handling:** Added a test to catch errors if the notebook file is not valid. This helps to prevent cryptic failures down the line.
* **Specific Error Checks (Important):**  The `except` block now checks for `KernelError` (or other specific exceptions relevant to your kernel) to provide more informative error messages and better identify the cause of failure.
* **Preserves original structure and logic** of the original `test_notebook_execution` function while enhancing the robustness and error handling.


This significantly improved version provides more helpful error messages, making debugging and identifying issues easier. Remember to replace `"../examples/"` with the actual path to your notebook folder.  Thorough testing of different notebook types and content will enhance the test suite further. Consider adding more specific exception handling for different kernel-related errors if necessary.
