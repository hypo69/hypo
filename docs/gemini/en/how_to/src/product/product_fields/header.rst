How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` that finds the root directory of a project.  It then initializes several variables containing project metadata (name, version, documentation, etc.)  by reading data from `settings.json` and `README.MD` files.  Crucially, it adds the project root directory to Python's module search path (`sys.path`).

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging.version`, and `gs`.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple `marker_files` as an argument. This tuple contains files or directories to use as markers to locate the project root.

3. **Find project root:** It starts from the directory of the current file (`__file__`).  It then iterates through parent directories, checking for the presence of any files or directories in `marker_files`. The first directory containing a marker file is considered the project root.

4. **Add project root to sys.path:** If the found project root is not already in `sys.path`, it's added to the beginning of the path.

5. **Return the project root:** The function returns the determined project root directory.

6. **Get project root directory:** The `__root__` variable is assigned the result of the `set_project_root` function call.

7. **Read project settings:** The code attempts to open and load the `settings.json` file located within the project root, parsing its contents into the `settings` variable.  Error handling (try-except block) is in place for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` in case the file doesn't exist or has invalid JSON.

8. **Read project documentation (README.MD):** Similar to the settings file, the code tries to read the `README.MD` file, parsing its content into the `doc_str` variable. Error handling is present for potential errors.

9. **Initialize project metadata variables:** Several variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc., are initialized with data from the `settings` dictionary. Default values are provided for cases where the corresponding keys might not exist in the JSON.

10. **Optional:** If `gs.path.root` is defined, it might be used in other parts of the project.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming you have a project structure and 'settings.json' and 'README.MD' files)
    from hypotez.src.product.product_fields.header import set_project_root

    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {root_dir}")
    print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project version: {__version__}")

    # ... further usage of __root__, __project_name__, __version__ and other variables ...
