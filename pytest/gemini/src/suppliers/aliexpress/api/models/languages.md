    #No methods or functions are present, so no further tests are needed.
    #Consider if a lookup table for language codes/names is planned
    #or any methods for retrieval of languages

    #Example of how to add tests for a getter method (if it existed)
    # def test_get_language_by_code_valid_input(self):
    #    assert Language.get_language_by_code('EN') == 'English'
    # or similar


# Import the class from the file
try:
    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api.models.languages import Language
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: ModuleNotFoundError - {e}")
    # Exit or handle the error appropriately.  This is crucial for testing.
    exit(1)  


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-except` block to handle potential `ModuleNotFoundError`. This is extremely important in testing because if the file you're testing doesn't exist or cannot be imported, your tests will fail.  It now exits with an error code, so your test runner knows it failed.
2. **Comprehensive Constant Testing:** The `test_constants` method now thoroughly checks all the defined constants in the `Language` class.  This is crucial because it tests that all the language codes are *correctly* assigned.
3. **Clear Test Function Names:** The test function names are clear and descriptive (e.g., `test_constants`).
4. **Isolation and Independence:** Each test case is a separate function, ensuring independence.
5. **No Unnecessary Fixtures:**  Since the provided code doesn't define functions to test, there are no fixture requirements.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Save the test code:**  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_languages.py`).

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest test_languages.py
   ```

**Further Considerations (if the code changes):**

If the Python code you're testing includes methods or functions that take inputs or return values, you'll need to add more specific test cases.  These will include valid input cases, invalid input cases (checking for exceptions and appropriate error messages), boundary cases (e.g., empty strings, very large numbers), and, potentially, edge cases that the code might handle in unexpected ways.  The examples I've added (commented out) show the framework of how to do this. Remember to adapt them to the *actual* methods in your `Language` class.  This more comprehensive approach is crucial for robust testing. Remember to adjust the `from ... import Language` line to match the actual location of your file within your project.
