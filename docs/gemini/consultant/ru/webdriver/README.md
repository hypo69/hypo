Changes Made
```
- Added a comprehensive module docstring in RST format, describing the purpose and functionalities of the module.
- Added a docstring for the `main` function, explaining its role and the examples it demonstrates.
- Wrapped the main function's code block with a `try...except` block to catch and log potential errors during execution. This significantly improves error handling and prevents the script from crashing.
- Replaced `print` statements with `logger.info` or `logger.error` depending on the context. This prepares the code for logging and allows for more flexible use of the output.
- Improved the docstrings for the examples (though the code itself remains mostly the same, the improved structure with docstrings will be very helpful for documentation generation).
- Added imports for necessary classes (e.g., `By`).
- Ensured the correct use of `logger` from the `src.logger` module for all error handling.
