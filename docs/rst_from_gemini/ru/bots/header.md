**Improvements and explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` during the loading of `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  Crucially, it prints informative error messages, preventing silent failures and aiding in debugging.  Also, it assigns an empty dictionary to `settings` or an empty string to `doc_str` in case of errors, preventing subsequent code from crashing.
* **Explicit Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` calls. This is **critical** to handle different file encodings correctly, especially if your project uses non-ASCII characters.
* **Simplified Variable Names:** Changed `__root__` to `project_root` for better readability and consistency.
* **Corrected `copyright`:** Changed `copyrihgnt` to `copyright` in the code for accurate variable usage.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The error handling now provides context by printing the specific error message that occurred.
* **Empty String for doc_str:** Added `doc_str = ""` as a default in the error handling for `README.MD` for better code robustness.
* **Removed unnecessary __root__ assignment:** Removed redundant assignment of `__root__` to `project_root` in the `get_project_root()` function, avoiding unnecessary variable usage.
* **Removed unnecessary trailing whitespace:** Cleaned up trailing whitespace for better code formatting.
* **Empty Dict for settings in case of error:**  Added `settings = {}` to the exception block. This ensures that `settings` is defined if the file doesn't exist/is malformed.

These improvements make the code more robust, readable, and maintainable, especially in real-world projects where unexpected files or data may arise. The error handling prevents crashes and allows you to more easily identify issues with the input files. The explicit encoding is crucial for working with files potentially containing characters outside the ASCII range. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you haven't already (`pip install packaging`).


This revised version is significantly more robust and suitable for production use. Remember to adapt the `marker_files` tuple if your project uses different files to indicate the project root.
