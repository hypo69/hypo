## פונקציות

### `initialize_board`

**Description**: מאתחלת את לוח המשחק (חפיסת השוקולד).

**Parameters**:
- `rows` (int): מספר השורות בלוח.
- `cols` (int): מספר העמודות בלוח.

**Returns**:
- `list of lists`: רשימה של רשימות המייצגת את לוח המשחק, כאשר 'X' - שוקולד, ' ' - מקום ריק.

### `display_board`

**Description**: מציגה את המצב הנוכחי של הלוח על המסך.

**Parameters**:
- `board` (list of lists): לוח המשחק.
