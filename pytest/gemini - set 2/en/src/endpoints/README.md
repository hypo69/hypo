```python
import pytest

# No Python code provided to test.  The example README.md file describes modules, not functions.
# Therefore, no test cases can be generated.

# Placeholder test (replace with actual tests when provided code is present)
def test_placeholder():
    """This is a placeholder test."""
    assert True
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code is a README file describing a Python module (`endpoints`) and its submodules.  It doesn't contain any Python functions or classes for testing.  Therefore, I cannot write meaningful test cases.

To generate proper tests, you need to provide the actual Python code from the modules mentioned in the README (e.g., `src/endpoints/prestashop.py`, `src/endpoints/advertisement.py`, etc.).  The README is just documentation.

**Example of how to write tests *if* the code were provided:**

Let's say the `prestashop.py` module contained a function like this:

```python
from src.endpoints.prestashop import PrestashopAPI

def get_product_by_id(product_id):
    """Retrieves a product by its ID from the PrestaShop API."""
    # (Implementation using the PrestashopAPI class)
    try:
        product = PrestashopAPI().get_product(product_id)
        return product
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error fetching product: {e}")

```

Then a possible test would be:

```python
import pytest
from src.endpoints.prestashop import get_product_by_id
from unittest.mock import Mock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_prestashop_api():
    """Mocks the PrestashopAPI for testing."""
    api = Mock()
    api.get_product.return_value = {"id": 123, "name": "Test Product"}
    return api


def test_get_product_by_id_valid_input(mock_prestashop_api):
    """Tests with valid input."""
    product_id = 123
    api = PrestashopAPI()
    api.get_product = mock_prestashop_api.get_product
    result = get_product_by_id(product_id)
    assert result == {"id": 123, "name": "Test Product"}


def test_get_product_by_id_invalid_input():
    """Tests if ValueError is raised with invalid input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Error fetching product:"):
        get_product_by_id(999)  # Invalid product ID example


# ... other test functions for edge cases or invalid inputs ...
```

This example demonStartes mocking `PrestashopAPI` to isolate the test.  Replace the placeholder `PrestashopAPI` calls with your actual implementation.  Importantly, **replace the placeholder code** with the *actual* Python code you want to test. The structure of the tests would adapt based on the function's signature, behavior, and expected output.
