**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test function names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_root_directory_exception_handling`).

2. **Robust `test_root_directory`:** Checks if `__root__` is a `Path` object and if the path exists. This prevents cryptic errors if the extraction fails.

3. **`test_append_to_path`:**  Crucially, this test now accounts for the possibility that the path *already* exists in `sys.path`.  This is more realistic and prevents false negatives.  It also correctly removes the appended path, preventing interference with future tests or the code itself.

4. **`test_root_directory_exception_handling`:**  Tests the *exception* case, using `pytest.raises` to ensure the code handles situations where "hypotez" is not found.  This is a vital edge case.

5. **`test_root_path_with_no_hypotez`:** This test addresses a likely failure case where the hypotez folder is not found in the current path.  It uses `os.makedirs` to simulate this condition and then verifies that the returned path from `__root__` is valid and not the current working directory.

6. **Error Handling:** The tests now include checks for possible errors, especially in the `test_root_directory` function, using `assert isinstance(__root__, Path)` to catch problems early.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Save the test code in a file (e.g., `test_header.py`).

3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_header.py
    ```

This improved test suite provides much more comprehensive coverage and addresses potential issues in the code. Remember to adapt the tests to any further developments or changes in the `header.py` file.  If you expect other files (or even external data), you'd also want tests that cover those elements.
