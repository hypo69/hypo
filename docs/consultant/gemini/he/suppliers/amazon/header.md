```
Changes Made
```

- Added type hints (e.g., `-> Path` in `get_project_root`).
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error logging.
- Improved error handling with `logger.error` and more descriptive error messages.
- Renamed `__root__` to `PROJECT_ROOT` for better readability.
- Added detailed RST-style docstrings for all functions and variables.
- Improved variable names and structure for better clarity.
- Fixed a typo in `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Documented the module with a clear description.
- Improved variable names (e.g., `__project_name__` to `PROJECT_NAME`).
- Added `TODO` style notes where needed.
- Removed unnecessary comments.
