**Changes Made**

- Added type hints (`typing`) for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Imported `Path` from `pathlib`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` (assuming the `j_loads` function exists).
- Wrapped the main code block within a `try...except` block to catch and log exceptions using `logger.exception`. This prevents the script from crashing and provides better debugging information.
- Added error handling for individual operations within the `main` function to log errors appropriately. 
- Improved the docstring for the `main` function to match RST conventions.
- Made the code more robust by adding error handling to each example.
