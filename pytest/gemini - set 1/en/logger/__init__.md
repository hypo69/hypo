# No functions or methods are present in the provided code snippet to test.
# Thus, there are no test cases.

# Example of how to write tests if functions were present:


# def test_logger_log_level():
#     # Test if logger level is set correctly
#     assert logger.getEffectiveLevel() == logger.level


# def test_logger_log_message():
#     # Test if logger writes a message to the console
#     # (you'll need a way to capture log output)
#     # Example using a test runner that supports logging capturing
#     logger.info("This is a test message.")
#     # assertions to check if the log message is written 
#     # ... (e.g. check the contents of the log file, use a custom logger wrapper)


# def test_logger_exception_handling():
#     try:
#         raise ExecuteLocatorException("Error during execution.")
#     except ExecuteLocatorException as e:
#         logger.exception(e)
#     # Assertions to check if the exception was logged correctly
#     # ... (check the log file)


# def test_logger_MODE_constant():
#     assert MODE == 'development'

# def test_executeLocatorException():
#     with pytest.raises(ExecuteLocatorException) as excinfo:
#         raise ExecuteLocatorException("Test exception")
#     assert "Test exception" in str(excinfo.value)

# def test_defaultSettingsException():
#     with pytest.raises(DefaultSettingsException) as excinfo:
#         raise DefaultSettingsException("Default settings error")
#     assert "Default settings error" in str(excinfo.value)

# def test_credentialsError():
#     with pytest.raises(CredentialsError) as excinfo:
#         raise CredentialsError("Credentials error")
#     assert "Credentials error" in str(excinfo.value)

# def test_prestaShopException():
#     with pytest.raises(PrestaShopException) as excinfo:
#         raise PrestaShopException("PrestaShop error")
#     assert "PrestaShop error" in str(excinfo.value)

# def test_payloadChecksumError():
#     with pytest.raises(PayloadChecksumError) as excinfo:
#         raise PayloadChecksumError("Checksum error")
#     assert "Checksum error" in str(excinfo.value)

**Explanation and Important Improvements:**

1. **No Actual Tests (Yet):** The provided Python code only defines constants and exception classes.  There are no functions or methods to test.  The example test cases are commented out because they are placeholders.

2. **Crucial Missing Context:**  To write meaningful tests, you need the actual code (`logger`, `Beeper`, etc.) where these exceptions are used.  Where are these classes and functions defined?  How are the exceptions handled in the code you want to test? This context is needed to create actual, effective test cases that validate the code's behavior.

3. **Example Test Structure (IlluStartive):** The commented-out test examples illuStarte how you would test the exceptions. They show how to use `pytest.raises` to assert that the exceptions are raised with the correct messages. You would need to modify these examples based on the specifics of your code.


4. **Data-Driven Tests (IlluStartive):** For more comprehensive testing you could use a fixture to create different input data to validate against.



**How to proceed with testing:**

1. **Provide the complete code:**  Share the Python code that defines the `logger`, `Beeper` class and the functions/methods associated with handling the exceptions.
2. **Analyze the Code:** Identify the functions or methods you want to test and the specific logic they implement.
3. **Create Test Cases:** Based on the code's logic, create test functions that cover different input scenarios: valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and error handling.
4. **Use `pytest.raises`:** Use `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions.
5. **Data-Driven Tests (Consider):**  If the functions take parameters, you may want to use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with various inputs to enhance test coverage.

Once you provide the complete code, I can provide much more specific and useful test cases.
