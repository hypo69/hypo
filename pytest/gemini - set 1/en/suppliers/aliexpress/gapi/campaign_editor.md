# These examples are just placeholders.  You must replace them with
# actual test cases that target the specific functions and classes in
# your campaign_editor module.  Since the code only imports modules,
# you'll need to add the functions/classes themselves.


# Example test using pytest.raises for exception handling:


# def test_invalid_input_raises_exception(mock_header, mock_spreadsheet):
#   # Example: Testing a method that might raise an exception
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError): # Replace TypeError with actual exception
#         mock_spreadsheet.some_method("Invalid", 1)


# Important!  You must fill in the actual tests based on the functions/classes 
# defined in the `campaign_editor.py` file you haven't shown us.  The example
# tests above are only stubs.  Provide that file, and I can write appropriate tests.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now correctly mocks the `header` and `SpreadSheet` modules.  This is essential because we cannot test the code without the actual implementations of the modules.  Mocking allows us to simulate their behavior without relying on the real modules.

2. **Fixtures:** Fixtures are used to provide the mock objects. This is a good practice for better test organization and reusability.

3. **Empty Test Case Placeholder:** I've added a placeholder `test_no_functions_yet` test to verify that the necessary modules (mocked) are imported successfully.

4. **Example Test Placeholders:** Critically, example tests (`test_campaign_editor_function`, etc.) are now placeholders.  You MUST replace these with actual tests that target functions and methods defined in your `campaign_editor.py` file (which you haven't provided).

5. **Exception Handling:** The example `test_invalid_input_raises_exception` demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.  Replace the `TypeError` with the actual exception type that your code might raise.


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace the placeholders:** Add your actual functions and classes from `campaign_editor.py` to create the functions, methods, and classes these tests target.


2. **Modify Mock Behavior:** Adapt the mock objects (`mock_header` and `mock_spreadsheet`) to simulate the specific behavior of the methods in your code.  


3. **Add Assertions:** Write assertions to verify the expected results of your functions and methods when called with specific inputs. For example, check if the correct values are returned, or if exceptions are raised as expected.



**Example `campaign_editor.py` (to demonStarte the filling of the placeholders):**

```python
import header
from src.google import SpreadSheet

def some_function_to_test(data):
   # Add your actual code
   return data * 2


class CampaignEditor:
  def __init__(self, spreadsheet):
     self.spreadsheet = spreadsheet


  def process_campaign(self, campaign_id):
      # Add your actual logic to process campaigns here
      return self.spreadsheet.some_method(campaign_id, "some_parameter")
```


Then add tests in your test file targeting `some_function_to_test` and the `process_campaign` method of `CampaignEditor`. Remember to fill in the assertions and the `mock_spreadsheet.some_method` behavior.
