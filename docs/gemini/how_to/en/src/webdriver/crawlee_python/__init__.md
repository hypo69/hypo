## Usage Guide for `hypotez/src/webdriver/crawlee_python/__init__.py`

This file, `hypotez/src/webdriver/crawlee_python/__init__.py`, is an initialization file for a Python module likely related to web scraping or automation using a webdriver.

**Purpose:**

This file imports and likely configures the `CrawleePython` class.  It's crucial for using the functionality of the module.


**Key elements:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This variable likely defines the operating mode of the script.  `'dev'` suggests a development mode.  Other possible values might include `'prod'` for production.  This variable's use is critical for setting appropriate parameters or behaviors within the `CrawleePython` class.

* **`from .crawlee_python import CrawleePython`:** This line imports the `CrawleePython` class from the `crawlee_python.py` file located within the same directory. This is standard Python module import practice.


**How to use:**

To utilize the `CrawleePython` class, you would typically do the following:

1. **Import the class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.crawlee_python import CrawleePython
```

2. **Instantiate an object:**

```python
# Assuming a suitable constructor exists.
my_crawlee = CrawleePython()
```

3. **Call methods on the object:**

   The `CrawleePython` class will likely have methods to:

   * **Initialize the webdriver:**  This might involve setting up the browser, or a specific web driver.
   * **Perform actions:** Such as navigating to a website, filling out forms, or interacting with elements on web pages.
   * **Extract data:** This could involve parsing HTML, extracting text from elements, or managing cookies.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.crawlee_python import CrawleePython

def main():
    my_crawlee = CrawleePython()  # Instantiate the class
    my_crawlee.start_browser() # A possible method call
    my_crawlee.navigate_to('https://www.example.com')
    # ... other interactions ...
    my_crawlee.close_browser() # A possible method call

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`crawlee_python.py`:** This file (`crawlee_python.py`) likely contains the implementation of the `CrawleePython` class, defining the logic for web interaction.
* **Dependencies:** The code might depend on external libraries like Selenium or other webdrivers.  If so, ensure these dependencies are installed.
* **Error Handling:**  Crucial for robust scripts.  Use `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, element not found).
* **Documentation:** The `CrawleePython` class and its methods should have well-defined docstrings (within the `.crawlee_python` file) to explain their use and arguments.
