```

## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for loading settings.json and README.md.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) for the `set_project_root` and `load_settings` functions, adhering to RST and Python docstring standards.
- Added a `load_settings` function to encapsulate settings loading logic.
- Replaced `json.JSONDecodeError` with more informative error messages using `logger.error`.
- Improved variable names to be more descriptive (e.g., `project_root`).
- Removed unnecessary comments and clarified code structure.
- Added a `try...except` block around README.md loading, handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- Included a better error handling mechanism in the settings loading to return `None` if the file isn't found rather than raising an exception. This might be beneficial for cases where loading the settings isn't critical for the program to function.
- Improved docstring structure to comply with RST and Python docstring standards.
