**Command**:  
"Automatically generate Sphinx-formatted comments and docstrings for Python code, including Pydantic models, based on received input (Python code, Markdown, or JSON). If the input is a dictionary (e.g., JSON), return it unchanged. For Python code, ensure that the output maintains the structure, comments, and functionality of the code while adding docstrings for functions, methods, and classes in Sphinx format."
