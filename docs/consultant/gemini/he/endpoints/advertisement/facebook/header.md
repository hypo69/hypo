```
Changes Made
```
- Added missing `import` statement for `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` throughout the file.
- Added `from src.logger import logger` for error handling.
- Wrapped all `try...except` blocks in the file with appropriate error handling, logging errors to the logger.
- Added comprehensive RST-style documentation for the `get_project_root` function.
- Changed variable names to be more consistent and descriptive (e.g., `__root__` to `PROJECT_ROOT`).
- Improved variable names (e.g., `settings_file` to `settings_file_path`).
- Added a more descriptive docstring for the module.
- Added `TODO` items for potential improvements and tasks for the project.
- Improved variable naming conventions to be more consistent.
- The file now handles potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions during file reading. It logs the error using the logger, which is a best practice for production code.
