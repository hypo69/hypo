# Tests for the EmilDesign class (assuming it has methods)
# We need to create a mock EmilDesign class if it's not defined.
#  Add test cases for methods of EmilDesign class if any

#
#       def method1(self, arg1):

#           emil_design_instance.method1(123)

# Example of a test case assuming an emil_design_instance fixture
#   This is a placeholder,  you need to replace it with your actual class.

#       """Tests if EmilDesign instance is created correctly."""
#       assert isinstance(emil_design_instance, EmilDesign)

#  If there is no EmilDesign class and no relevant methods,
#  you might need to modify these tests (or remove them altogether)
#

# Example of testing for a potential AttributeError in case no methods
# are available in the EmilDesign class
#   def test_no_method_attribute_error(emil_design_instance):
#       with pytest.raises(AttributeError):  # Example of raising AttributeError
#           emil_design_instance.non_existent_method()


# Important:  If the emil.py file has other functions/classes,
# add your tests for them in a similar structure. The examples above
# are placeholders, and you need to replace them with your actual tests.
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing `EmilDesign` Class:** The provided code only defines the `MODE` constant. The tests above are now placeholders.  You need to update them with actual tests for the `EmilDesign` class if it exists and has methods.  If the `EmilDesign` class is not defined in `emil.py`, you need to determine if there's another relevant class or module you need to test and modify the tests accordingly.

2. **Mock Data (Fixtures):**  If `EmilDesign` has methods that depend on data, you'll need to create fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`) to provide that data for testing. The example shows how to create a placeholder `MockEmilDesign`.  Replace this with your actual `EmilDesign` and relevant methods and data.

3. **Error Handling:** The example tests now include `pytest.raises` to check if exceptions are raised appropriately when methods are called with invalid data types or for other cases where exceptions might be needed.

4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Add more tests covering various possible scenarios for `EmilDesign` functions, such as edge cases, boundary conditions, and different input data types.

5. **Clear and Descriptive Names:**  Test function names should clearly communicate the purpose of each test, as demonstrated in the example tests.

6. **Independent Tests:** Each test should be isolated and not rely on the outcome of other tests.

7. **Realistic Data:** Use realistic and meaningful data in your tests, not just random values. This is crucial for testing the robustness of your code.

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual code and add tests that fit the implementation in your `emil.py` file.  If `emil.py` contains no other classes or functions, then the current tests are about as thorough as possible, since the only thing was a single constant.
