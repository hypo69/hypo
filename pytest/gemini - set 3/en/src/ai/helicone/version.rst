**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `settings.json`:** The code now uses `mock_settings_file` to create a temporary `settings.json` file for testing, removing the need for a real file and avoiding potential issues with file access.
* **Error Handling:** Tests are added to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, validating the correct behavior when `settings.json` is not found or has invalid JSON.
* **Edge Cases:** Tests for an empty `settings.json` and invalid JSON content are included.
* **Cleanup:** The temporary `settings.json` file is removed after each test using `os.remove(mock_file)` to prevent file system pollution.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and informative.
* **Import fixes:** The code is now importing the correct modules with their necessary attributes for proper testing.
* **pytest fixtures:** Fixtures were not needed in this particular case as the solution does not rely on external input but hardcoded strings.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code (e.g., as `test_version.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/ai/helicone/version.py` file.
2.  Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_version.py`.


**Important Note:** The original code used `__root__` which is not a standard Python construct. This was replaced by `Path("settings.json")`. This assumes you want to test in a temporary directory and thus creates a temporary file. If you intend for the tests to interact with a specific project's files, `__root__` should be replaced with a way to set the appropriate path. You will need to adapt the `mock_settings_file` function if needed to your directory structure and ensure tests are run in a way that avoids side effects to other parts of the project.


This improved test suite provides more comprehensive and robust testing for the `version.py` module, covering various scenarios and potential issues. Remember to adapt the test setup if your actual project structure differs.
