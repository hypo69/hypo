**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Mocks:** The code now includes fixtures (`mock_project_root`, `settings_data`, `mock_settings_file`, `mock_readme_file`) to create mock files and directories, making tests more isolated and reusable.  This is crucial for testing `set_project_root()` as it depends on files.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover various scenarios: existing file, no file, multiple marker files, parent directory, and a case where the input to `marker_files` is invalid. This ensures broader coverage.
* **Error Handling:** Added a `test_set_project_root_invalid_input` test to verify the handling of `TypeError` when `marker_files` is not a tuple.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability.
* **Using `tmp_path`:** Correctly utilizes `tmp_path` to create temporary directories for the tests, ensuring they don't interfere with each other.
* **Robust Settings and README Tests:** Added tests for both cases—success (`test_settings_load_success`, `test_readme_load_success`) and failure (`test_settings_load_missing_file`, `test_readme_load_missing_file`)—when loading `settings.json` and `README.MD` files.
* **Assertions:** Assertions have been added to validate the expected outputs, ensuring the tests are accurate.
* **Handling `None` Values:** Added checks for `settings` and `doc_str` being `None` in the appropriate tests to handle the cases when the files are missing.

This revised solution addresses the requirements, offers more thorough testing, and is more maintainable. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pytest`, `packaging`, and `json`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have `requirements.txt`).  Make sure `hypotez/src/suppliers/cdata/header.py` is in the correct location and adjust paths if necessary. Then run `pytest` from your terminal.
