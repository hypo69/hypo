**Example Request**:  

```python
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result
```

**Expected Response**:  

```
<input code>
from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = calculate_sum(a, b)
    return result

<algorithm>
1. The function `calculate_sum` is imported from the `src.utils.calculator` module.
2. A function `add_numbers` is defined, taking two arguments, `a` and `b`.
3. The `calculate_sum(a, b)` function is called to compute the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. The result of the function is returned to the caller.

Example:  
- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 5`.  
- Algorithm: `calculate_sum(3, 5)`.  
- Result: `8`.  

<explanation>
**Imports**:  
- `from src.utils.calculator import calculate_sum`: Imports the `calculate_sum` function, which is used to perform the addition. This module is located in the `src.utils` package.

**Function `add_numbers`**:  
- Purpose: Simplifies the addition of two numbers by utilizing the `calculate_sum` function.  
- Arguments:  
  - `a` (number): The first operand.  
  - `b` (number): The second operand.  
- Return Value: The result of adding `a` and `b`.  

**Relationship with Other Packages**:  
- The `src.utils.calculator` module is likely part of a library for mathematical operations.  
- If `calculate_sum` relies on additional modules, this can be clarified in its documentation.

**Possible Improvements**:  
- Add type checks for the `a` and `b` arguments to prevent errors.  
- Localize the `calculate_sum` call within the module if it is not reused elsewhere.
