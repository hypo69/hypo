# Changes Made

*   Added `import json` and `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for file reading.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings for the `get_shop_data` function using reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, returning `None` in case of errors instead of crashing.
*   Improved variable names for clarity.
*   Added type hints for the `shop_id` parameter and the return value.
*   Fixed and commented out the unnecessary import `from ... import ...`
*   The code block in `get_shop_data` function for reading the shop data has been restructured and the json.load function replaced by j_loads from `utils.jjson`.
*   Added `exc_info=True` in logger.error to provide more context in error reporting.
*   Added missing imports and ensured compatibility with other parts of the codebase.
