**Improvements:**

* **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the class and methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.  This significantly improves code readability and understanding.
* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors during `page.title()` and `page.content()` calls.  This prevents the script from crashing if a website returns unexpected data or encounters an issue.  Critically, it logs errors so you know *why* a particular URL failed to process.
* **Content Length:** Increased the content extraction limit to 1000 characters (from 100).  This is more likely to capture useful information from pages.
* **Data Output:** Prints the *entire* `data` dictionary, which is invaluable for debugging and inspecting the output from the crawler.
* **Example Usage:**  Made the example usage more realistic and improved commenting.  Crucially, it uses a sample list of URLs instead of a single URL.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Used more descriptive variable names (`urls_to_crawl`).
* **Robustness:** The example now has a list of URLs to crawl, which is much more practical for realistic web scraping.
* **Error Logging:**  Log errors to understand what went wrong with a specific URL.

**Before running:**

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install playwright crawlee
   ```
2. **Ensure `gs` is correctly configured:**  The code relies on a `gs` object (likely from your project). You need to ensure that `gs.path.tmp` is defined correctly and points to the expected temporary directory.

This significantly improved version is much more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly. Remember to replace `['https://example.com', 'https://www.example.org']` with the actual URLs you want to crawl.  Always test with a small set of URLs first before running against a large list.  Crucially, the output will help you identify problems! Remember to adapt the `urls_to_crawl` list to the URLs you need to scrape.
