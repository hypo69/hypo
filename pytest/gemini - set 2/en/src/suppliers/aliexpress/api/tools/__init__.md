**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Test Data Fixture:** Created a `test_data` fixture to hold various URL inputs, including valid, invalid, malformed, and edge cases (empty, None). This improves organization and readability.

2. **Clear Test Names:** Test names like `test_get_product_id_invalid_input` are self-explanatory.

3. **Exception Handling:** Used `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct exception type (`ValueError`) is raised with invalid inputs. Importantly, it checks the *message* of the exception to ensure the specific error is caught, preventing false positives.

4. **Edge Cases:** Included tests for empty strings and `None` inputs, which are common edge cases.

5. **Robustness:** The tests now cover various potential issues like malformed URLs (missing ".html" part), URLs with query parameters, which are common in real-world scenarios.

6. **Error Message Assertions:**  Crucially, the error message is checked to verify that the correct error is raised.  This is critical for debugging and ensuring that your `get_product_id` function's error handling is working correctly.

7. **Type Handling:** The test now includes a `TypeError` check for the case when the input `url` is `None`. This will help in identifying issues if the function has type checking.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have pytest installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_aliexpress_tools.py`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_aliexpress_tools.py`


This improved test suite is more comprehensive, robust, and better reflects real-world usage scenarios for `get_product_id`. Remember to adapt the test data to accurately reflect the behavior of your actual `get_product_id` function.  If `get_product_id` interacts with external services, simulate various response possibilities (like non-200 status codes) in your tests.
