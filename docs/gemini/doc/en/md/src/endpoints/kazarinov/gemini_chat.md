# hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/gemini_chat.py

## Overview

This module handles model training and dialog generation for the Kazarinov project using GoogleGenerativeAI. It defines a `KazarinovAI` class for interacting with the Gemini model, including training, question answering, and dialog functionality.  The `chat()` function provides a user interface for interacting with the trained model.


## Classes

### `KazarinovAI`

**Description**: This class handles model training and dialog generation for the Kazarinov project using GoogleGenerativeAI. It manages API keys, system instructions, and training data.

**Attributes**:

- `api_key`: str. The API key for accessing the GoogleGenerativeAI model.
- `base_path`: Path. Base path for system instructions and training files on Google Drive.
- `system_instruction_list`: list. List of system instructions read from files in `base_path`.
- `history_file`: str. Filename for storing conversation history.
- `gemini_1`: GoogleGenerativeAI. Instance of the Gemini model.
- `gemini_2`: GoogleGenerativeAI. Another instance of the Gemini model (used for redundancy?).
- `timestamp`: str. Current timestamp (likely used for file naming).

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`

**Description**: Initializes the `KazarinovAI` object.

**Parameters**:

- `system_instruction` (str, optional): Instruction for the model's system role. Defaults to None.
- `generation_config` (dict | list[dict], optional): Configuration for content generation. Defaults to `{"response_mime_type": "text/plain"}`.

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there's an error initializing the GoogleGenerativeAI model.


#### `train`

**Description**: Trains the model using the provided list of training files.

**Parameters**:

- `train_files` (list | str): A list or single file name for training.


**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there's a problem processing training data.


#### `question_answer`

**Description**: Handles the question-answering process.

**Parameters**:
- `train_files` (list | str): A list or single file name for training questions.


**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there's a problem reading or processing questions.



#### `dialog`

**Description**: Runs a dialog based on pre-defined questions, shuffling them.

**Raises**:

- `Exception`: If there's a problem reading or shuffling questions.



#### `ask`

**Description**: Asks a question to the Gemini model.

**Parameters**:

- `q` (str): The question to ask.
- `no_log` (bool, optional): Whether to disable logging. Defaults to `False`.
- `with_pretrain` (bool, optional): Whether to use pretrain data. Defaults to `True`.

**Returns**:

- bool: Boolean indicating success or failure of the ask operation.


### `chat`

**Description**: Initiates a chat session with the AI assistant, Kazarinov.

**Parameters**:

None

**Raises**:
- `Exception`: If there is an issue reading system instruction files.

## Global Variables

- `MODE`: str.  Value of 'dev' (likely for development mode).


## File Notes

This file uses the `GoogleGenerativeAI` class from another module, likely interacting with the Google Gemini API. The structure seems to define a complex system for training and interacting with an AI model.  The `train` method is designed to handle large datasets, breaking them into chunks.  The `chat` function provides a basic interface for user interaction. There's extensive use of `pprint` for output formatting, and `logger` for logging,  along with GoogleDrive related file paths.  Comments explaining the flow and intentions behind the code are quite detailed.  Important modules used include `header`, `time`, `json`, `random`, `pathlib`, etc.  The structure is quite well-commented but could benefit from more clarity on the specific Gemini API calls.
