```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  Added `pytest.raises` for `FileNotFoundError` and other potential exceptions.  Crucially, it checks for the *correct* error message using `assert "string" in str(excinfo.value)`. This is vastly better than simply asserting the exception type.
* **`sample_xls` Fixture:**  This is now a proper fixture that uses `pytest.tmpdir` to create a temporary Excel file for testing, removing the need to manually create a test file. This is crucial for avoiding test leakage.
* **Clearer Assertions:** The example `test_xls2dict_valid_input` now demonstrates how to use `isinstance` to check if the function returns the expected type and basic asserts can be added for the structure of the returned data.
* **Specific Error Messages:** Tests now include more descriptive error messages to aid in debugging.
* **Realistic Data:** Sample data (`SAMPLE_DATA`) is now shown, and the `xls2dict` example now includes assertions on the returned data and file content (that should be adjusted based on the actual contents).
* **Import Errors:**  The imports are corrected.
* **Valid File Input:** The `test_xls2dict_valid_input` now has a sample `sample_xls` fixture.
* **Testing `save_xls_file`:**  The `save_xls_file` test now checks both valid and invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect file types).  The `save_xls_file` test has a more comprehensive example for error handling, testing various types of invalid input (such as incorrect file types or data types)


**How to Use:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest openpyxl #Important:Install openpyxl to generate Excel files
    ```

2.  **Replace Placeholders:** Modify the `SAMPLE_DATA`, `TEST_FILE`, `sample_xls` fixture, and assertions with your actual data and file paths. Adjust the error handling parts to match your expected behavior.



**Important:** The `xls2dict` and `save_xls_file` functions need to be implemented properly (with a library like `openpyxl`) in order for these tests to be usable.  The example `sample_xls` is a placeholder.  You'll need to fill in the actual Excel file creation logic.  The assertions inside the test functions will need to check for the actual structure of the returned data.
