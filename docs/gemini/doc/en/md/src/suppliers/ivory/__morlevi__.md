# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/__morlevi__.py

## Overview

This module contains functions related to interacting with the Morlevi website for product data retrieval.  It handles login, product page scraping, and pagination through product listings.  It leverages Selenium for web interaction and other libraries for data manipulation (requests, pandas, etc.).


## Classes

### `Product`

**Description**: (Assumed from the code, as no explicit class definition is present.)  A class likely to represent a single product, containing attributes/fields to store product details.  Methods are likely used to retrieve and store information.

**Methods:** (Assumed methods, inferred from the code)

* `__init__(supplier)`: Constructor to initialize a Product object with a `supplier` object.
* `get_product_details()`: Retrieves product details from the webpage. (Likely this method is composed of several sub-functions/steps.)


## Functions

### `login`

**Description**: Handles the login process for the Morlevi website.  It attempts to log in and deals with potential popups or errors during the process.

**Parameters:**
- `supplier` (object): An object representing the supplier details, including the driver, locators, and settings.


**Returns:**
- `bool`: `True` if login is successful, `None` if unsuccessful.


**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception encountered during the login process.


### `_login`

**Description**:  Handles the core login logic within the `login` function.

**Parameters:**
- `_s` (object): The `supplier` object, which contains details about the web driver, locators, and other needed information.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `True` if login is successful, `None` if unsuccessful.

**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception encountered during the core login steps.

### `grab_product_page`

**Description**: Retrieves product details from a specific product page on the Morlevi website.

**Parameters:**
- `s` (object):  The `supplier` object containing the webdriver instance and locator information.


**Returns:**
- `Product`: A `Product` object filled with the product's data.


**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception during product page scraping.


### `list_products_in_category_from_pagination`

**Description**: Retrieves a list of product URLs within a given category by paginating through the product list.

**Parameters:**
- `supplier` (object): The `supplier` object containing the webdriver instance and locator information for the pagination and product links.

**Returns:**
- `list`: A list of product URLs within the category.  Returns an empty list if no products are found or errors occur.


**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception during pagination or product URL retrieval.


### `get_list_products_in_category`

**Description**:  Collects product listings in a category.

**Parameters:**
- `s` (object): The `supplier` object.
- `scenario` (JSON): A JSON object (presumably defining the scenario).
- `presath` (PrestaShopWebServiceDict):  A dictionary for PrestaShop API interactions (possibly).

**Returns:**
- `list`: (Assumed) A list of products found in the category.


**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception during the product listing retrieval or processing.


### `get_list_categories_from_site`

**Description**: Retrieves the list of categories from the Morlevi website.


**Parameters:**
- `s` (object): The `supplier` object.
- `scenario_file` (str): Name of the scenario file.
- `brand` (str, optional): Brand filter (defaults to empty string).

**Returns:**
- `list`: A list of categories. (Note, no return details are provided in the code for the method)


**Raises:**
- `Exception`: Any exception during category retrieval.

## Notes

- The code heavily relies on a `supplier` object to manage the interaction with the website. This object should contain webdriver instances, locators, and any relevant configuration.
- The code includes several placeholder comments (`TODO`, etc.) and needs additional documentation in order to be complete and readily usable.
- `Product` class should be explicitly defined for a full and robust solution.
- The use of `logger` suggests logging is enabled.  Add details about the logging library or framework used.
- The code utilizes `execute_locator` and `click` methods which should be clearly defined within the `supplier` object or the webdriver instance.
- The structure and behavior of the `s.locators` are not fully defined; this is a key aspect of the module, needing complete specification for usage.
