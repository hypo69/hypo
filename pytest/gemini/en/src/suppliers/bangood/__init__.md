**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `requests`:** The code now uses `mock_requests` fixture to mock the `requests` library.  This is **crucial** for testing functions that interact with external APIs.  It prevents your tests from actually making network requests, which are slow and unreliable in testing.  The fixture defines mock responses for different scenarios (e.g., success, failure) in specific `test_` functions.
* **Clearer Failure Handling:** The `test_get_list_categories_from_site_failure` and `test_get_list_products_in_category_failure` tests now use `pytest.raises` to assert that the correct exception is raised when the API call fails.  This is more robust than simply checking for `None`.
* **Specific Exception Handling:**  `test_get_list_products_in_category_invalid_category_id` now uses a more specific exception.
* **Realistic Error Messages:** The tests now give informative error messages, like "Invalid category ID," making debugging easier if a test fails.
* **Placeholder Tests:**  The example test `test_graber_method` remains commented out, as you did not provide a `Graber` class. You'd need to adapt these tests to the actual methods of your `Graber` class and provide dummy data or mock responses for `Graber` operations if needed.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_bangood.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_bangood.py`

**Important Considerations:**

* **Mock Response Structure:** You need to define appropriate mock responses (`mock_get` in the fixture) that reflect the expected structure of the responses from the `banggood.com` API.  The example uses basic success responses. You'll need to adapt the structure to reflect real API responses.
* **Valid Input Data:** Replace the placeholder values like `123` in `test_get_list_products_in_category_success` with actual valid category IDs from the `banggood.com` site.
* **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling (e.g., specific exceptions) for all possible API errors (e.g., invalid API keys, network issues, JSON parsing errors).
* **`Graber` Class Tests:** If you have a `Graber` class, provide appropriate test cases for its methods, mocking the necessary dependencies.


This revised answer provides a more complete and practical approach to testing your code, including mocking external dependencies and proper exception handling. Remember to adapt the tests to the actual structure and functionality of your code. Remember to adapt the tests for your `Graber` class and mock its dependencies appropriately.
