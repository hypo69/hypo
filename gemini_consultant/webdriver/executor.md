"""
The purpose of the `executor` module is to perform actions on web elements based on provided configurations, 
known as "locators." These configurations (or "locators") are dictionaries containing information on how to locate and interact with elements on a web page. The module provides the following functionalities:

1. **Parsing and Handling Locators**: Converts dictionaries with configurations into `SimpleNamespace` objects, 
allowing for flexible manipulation of locator data.

2. **Interacting with Web Elements**: Depending on the provided data, the module can perform various actions such as clicks, 
sending messages, executing events, and retrieving attributes from web elements.

3. **Error Handling**: The module supports continuing execution in case of an error, allowing for the processing of web pages 
that might have unstable elements or require a special approach.

4. **Support for Multiple Locator Types**: Handles both single and multiple locators, enabling the identification and interaction 
with one or several web elements simultaneously.

This module provides flexibility and versatility in working with web elements, enabling the automation of complex web interaction scenarios.

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`StaleElementReferenceException` Handling:** The crucial addition is catching `StaleElementReferenceException`.  This exception occurs when the element you're trying to interact with has been detached from the DOM (e.g., the page reloaded).  Robust Selenium code **must** handle this.  The `try...except` block now includes this, logging the full exception with `exc_info=True` for better debugging.

* **Simplified `type` Event:** The `event.startswith("send_keys(")` section is simplified. Now it directly handles the `type` event without a separate `elif`.  This makes the code more concise and readable.

* **Logging:**  Adding `exc_info=True` to `logger.error` is vital for debugging. It provides a complete traceback, making it much easier to identify the cause of an exception within the Selenium interaction.

* **Error Handling Consistency:**  Improved consistency in the `try...except` blocks:  Catch `Exception` as the last resort, but log details in each place to help trace problems.

* **Potential Bug Fix:** The previous handling of `type` often created problems because it tried to use ActionChains (`actions.send_keys(...)`) for simple typing.  This update correctly uses `webelement.send_keys` instead of `ActionChains`.


**How to Use:**

```python
import asyncio
# ... (your code)

async def run_script(driver):
    locators = [
        {"by": "ID", "selector": "myElement", "event": "click()"},
        {"by": "CSS_SELECTOR", "selector": "input[name='message']", "event": "type(Hello World)"},
        {"by": "XPATH", "selector": "//button[@id='submit']", "event": "click()"},
    ]

    executor = ExecuteLocator(driver=driver)
    for locator_data in locators:
        await executor.execute_locator(locator_data)

# ... (rest of your code)
```

Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`gs.mode`:** Ensure `gs.mode` is properly set and used in your overall application, as this influences debugging output.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  The code is asynchronous, which is crucial for Selenium automation to avoid blocking the main thread.  Use `asyncio` and `await` correctly.
* **Driver Initialization:**  Make sure you have initialized your Selenium WebDriver (`driver`) properly before using `ExecuteLocator`.

These modifications provide a significantly more robust and reliable approach to handling potential exceptions, particularly `StaleElementReferenceException`. Remember to always inspect error messages and stack traces thoroughly when debugging. Remember to install the necessary packages for this code to work (selenium, asyncio).
