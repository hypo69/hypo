**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to `promote_post` and `promote_event` to catch potential errors during execution and log them.  Crucially, this prevents the entire script from crashing if one post fails.
* **Driver Initialization Check:** Added a check in `promote_post` and `promote_event` to ensure the `self.d` (driver) object is initialized before using it.  This prevents errors when a method is called before the driver is properly established.
* **Login Check:** The `__init__` method now checks if the current URL is the expected `start_page`. If not, it calls `self.login()` and raises an exception if the login fails, ensuring the user is on the correct page before proceeding.
* **Clearer Docstrings:**  Docstrings are improved to be more informative and helpful.  The docstring for `__init__` now clearly explains the purpose of accepting a driver, and includes the critical @todo item.
* **Parameter Validation:**  While not absolutely necessary, validating that `item` and `event` are `SimpleNamespace` objects could improve robustness.
* **`group_file_paths` Handling:** The `__init__` method now correctly stores the `group_file_paths` for future use in the class.

**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (assuming you have a 'driver' object already)
fb = Facebook(driver, "YourPromoterName", ["path/to/file1.jpg", "path/to/file2.png"])
item = SimpleNamespace(message="Your post message", ...other_data...)

if fb.promote_post(item):
	print("Post successful.")
else:
	print("Post failed.")

# ... other Facebook interactions
```

This revised code is significantly more robust and maintainable, adhering to best practices for error handling and object-oriented programming. Remember to replace placeholders like `"YourPromoterName"` and file paths with your actual values.  Importantly, ensure your webdriver (`Driver`) object is correctly initialized and operational before instantiating the `Facebook` class. Also, ensure the `login` function in `./scenarios/login.py` is correctly implemented and configured for your specific Facebook login requirements.
