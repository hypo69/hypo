**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The solution now uses `pytest.fixture` to create mock `settings.json` and `pyproject.toml` files for testing, removing reliance on the actual file system. This is crucial for unit testing and makes the tests more reproducible and independent.


* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover more scenarios:
    * Valid input (marker files present).
    * Missing marker files.
    * Marker file in a subdirectory.
    * Handling cases where the root directory is already in `sys.path`.
    * Explicit handling of exceptions (using `pytest.raises`).
    * Testing loading of settings when the file exists and also when it doesn't


* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive.


* **`pytest.raises`:** This is now correctly used to test exception handling, catching `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`


* **`mock_root_dir` fixture:** Added a fixture to create the mock project directory structure, making the tests more concise.


* **Using `Path` objects:**  The tests now correctly use `Path` objects for file paths, which is best practice for handling file paths in Python.


**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the tests and the code you want to test in the same directory.
3.  Run `pytest` from your terminal.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual tests for other functions if they exist.


This improved solution addresses the missing parts and provides a robust set of test cases for the provided code.  This should be sufficient to thoroughly cover most of the function's possible behaviors. Remember to adapt it to the specific logic of any other functions in the code.
