**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Testing Functionality:** The provided Python code only imports classes.  Without any functions or methods defined in those classes, there's nothing to test in terms of their behavior.  This is why the tests are currently very basic (import checks).


2. **Example Structure:** The example structure in the prompt is crucial for structuring your test cases.  This solution demonstrates a basic structure for testing if the classes exist and can be imported, which is the minimum you should do, but more substantial tests are needed if the classes define behaviors that can be tested.


3. **Error Handling (pytest.raises):** The prompt mentions `pytest.raises`.  Error handling tests are important. However, as there's no code to raise exceptions, this is not used in this example.


4. **Fixtures:**  Fixtures are necessary for complex tests. This example does not require fixtures as there is no logic requiring external data.


5. **Thoroughness:**  Real-world tests need to be significantly more comprehensive.  If the imported classes have methods or functions that handle data (e.g., API calls or database interactions), you should create test data and write tests to verify their behavior with valid, invalid, and edge case inputs.


**How to Proceed:**

1. **Provide Code for `api` module:** Update the `input_code` with the Python code from the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api.py` file or any other related modules.


2. **Identify Functions/Methods:**  Identify the functions or methods within the classes that you want to test.


3. **Create Test Cases:** Write test functions that cover the different scenarios for each function/method (valid input, invalid input, edge cases). Include clear descriptions within the docstrings.


4. **Example `api.py` (Illustrative):**
   ```python
   # hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api.py
   def get_products():
       # ... implementation
       return [{"id": 1, "name": "Product 1"}]
   ```

5. **Corresponding Tests (Example):**
   ```python
   import pytest
   from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import get_products

   def test_get_products_valid():
       products = get_products()
       assert len(products) == 1
       assert products[0]["id"] == 1
   ```

With the actual code, you'll be able to create more meaningful and comprehensive test cases to verify the functionality of your PrestaShop endpoints. Remember to use `pytest` to run your tests.
