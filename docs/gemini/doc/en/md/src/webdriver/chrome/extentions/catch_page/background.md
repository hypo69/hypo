# background.js

## Overview

This JavaScript file contains the background script for a Chrome extension. It listens for messages from content scripts and sends data to a server when a specific message is received.  It utilizes `chrome.action`, `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.storage.local`, and `fetch` APIs for communication and data handling.

## Functions

### `chrome.action.onClicked.addListener`

**Description**: This function listens for clicks on the extension's action icon.  When clicked, it sends a message to the current tab to collect data.

**Parameters**:

- `tab` (object):  Details about the current tab where the extension action was clicked.

**Returns**:
-  None

**Raises**:
-  No exceptions explicitly raised.


### `sendDataToServer`

**Description**: This function sends collected data to a server using a POST request.  It retrieves the data from `chrome.storage.local` and uses the `fetch` API for the request.

**Parameters**:

- `url` (string): The URL of the page whose data is to be collected. This parameter is not directly used within this function, it is simply passed from the calling context and is utilized within the `message.url` that is passed to this function.

**Returns**:
- None

**Raises**:
- `Error`: If the server request fails (e.g., network issue or server error).

**Notes**:

- It expects collected data to be available in the `chrome.storage.local`.
- The server URL (`http://127.0.0.1/hypotez/catch_request.php`) should be updated to the correct endpoint.


## Notes

- Error handling in `sendDataToServer` could be improved with more specific error types and logging.  For instance, rather than just `console.error`, the `catch` block could attempt to parse the response status code and provide more informative feedback to the user.
- The code assumes data is stored in `chrome.storage.local` as a key called 'collectedData'.  The way this data is collected and stored is not shown but is a critical part of the application's flow.  This documentation should be expanded to explain how this data is gathered.
- The function `sendDataToServer` is designed to handle potential errors gracefully.  This includes errors from the fetch request and cases where no data has been collected.
