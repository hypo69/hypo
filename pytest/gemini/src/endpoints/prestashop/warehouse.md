**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now heavily uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `gs`, `header`, and `PrestaShop` classes. This is crucial because it isolates the `PrestaWarehouse` class from the actual dependencies and allows testing its logic without relying on external services.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names are more descriptive, reflecting the specific aspect being tested.

3. **Exception Handling:** The `test_presta_warehouse_invalid_input` demonstrates how to test exception handling using `pytest.raises`. This is essential to verify how the class behaves when confronted with errors.

4. **Example for Method Testing:** The `test_presta_warehouse_method` includes an example for testing a method of `PrestaWarehouse`.  Crucially, it also checks the logger, which is critical if you use logging in your code.

5. **Mode Testing:** Included `test_presta_warehouse_mode_setting` to illustrate a simple test case for checking if the `MODE` variable is set correctly.

6. **Important Imports:** Ensures the necessary modules (`logger`) are imported for testing.

7. **Completeness:**  The provided solution lacks complete testing. You must replace the example mocks and functions with the actual code you want to test for comprehensive test coverage.

**How to use:**

1. **Replace Mock Classes:** Replace the mock classes (`MockPrestaShop`, etc.) with the actual implementation of your `gs`, `header` modules and the `PrestaShop` class.  If it's a complex class, mock only the specific method(s) you need to test.

2. **Add Tests for Methods and Attributes:** Add tests for methods (`do_something`, etc.), constructor attributes, and any other relevant parts of your `PrestaWarehouse` class.

3. **Install pytest:** If you haven't already, install pytest: `pip install pytest`.

4. **Run Tests:** Navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run `pytest`. This will execute the test suite.


Remember to adapt the example test cases and add more tests to cover various scenarios, including edge cases, invalid inputs, and different combinations of inputs.   Consider using data-driven tests (using `pytest.mark.parametrize`) to automate tests with multiple inputs.  Critically, ensure you're mocking (or replacing) dependencies to avoid actual API calls or external program execution within your tests. Remember to also validate any outputs from your methods.
