**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The solution now mocks the `process_product` function.  This is crucial for testing the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class in isolation without relying on external dependencies like network calls.

2. **`ProductData` Class:**  A `ProductData` class is created to hold product data, making the tests more readable and organized.

3. **Clearer Tests:**  The tests are more descriptive and concise, clearly stating the expected outcome for each case.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover valid input, empty input, and an invalid URL.

5. **Error Handling:** The test for invalid product IDs demonstrates testing for a scenario that may return `None`.

6. **pytest Fixtures:**  Fixtures are correctly used to set up the `parser` instance.

7. **`assert` statements:**  The `assert` statements are now more specific and accurate, checking for the expected values of the `product` attributes.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_affiliated_products.py`).
2. Make sure the `src.suppliers.aliexpress.affiliated_products_generator` file (or the code containing the `AliAffiliatedProducts` class) is also in the correct location in your project.
3. Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_affiliated_products.py`.


**Further Improvements:**

* **More Edge Cases:** Consider more edge cases, like empty `product_urls`, different types of product IDs (numbers, strings), and various invalid URL formats.
* **Exception Handling:**  Add tests to verify that the code correctly handles potential exceptions (e.g., invalid URLs).
* **Mock HTTP requests:** For a real-world scenario, you would likely need to mock HTTP requests to simulate interactions with the AliExpress API, which is not included here but a typical step for production code.
