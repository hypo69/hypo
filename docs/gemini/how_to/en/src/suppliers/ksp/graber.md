.. module: src.suppliers.ksp
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect product field values from `ksp.co.il`.
    Each product page field has a corresponding processing function in the parent class.
    Overload the function in this class if non-standard processing is needed.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, you can perform preliminary actions using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To use it, pass a value to `Context.locator`.
    To implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines and redefine its behavior.

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`Context` Class:** Now correctly handles storing the driver instance.  Critically, the `locator_for_decorator` attribute is added to `Context`. This is crucial for the decorator to function.
* **`close_pop_up` Decorator:**
    * The decorator now correctly uses `Context.driver` and `Context.locator_for_decorator` to execute the locator if it's set.
    *  The `try...except` block handles potential `ExecuteLocatorException` within the decorator.
    * The decorator is now called correctly within the `grab_page` function.


* **`grab_page` Function:**
    * Takes the `id_product` as an argument, passing it to the `_fetch_all_data` function.  This is essential for any function that needs to grab specific product information.
    * Uses `await close_pop_up()(self._fetch_all_data)` if a decorator is needed to invoke the `close_pop_up` decorator before calling the underlying function.  This is much cleaner than before.
    * **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...except` block to catch and log any errors during the data fetching process. This prevents the entire script from crashing if there's a problem with a specific field.  It also re-raises the exception so it can be handled further up the call stack if needed.


* **`_fetch_all_data` Function:** This is a placeholder for your data extraction logic.  It's *crucial* to implement this function to call the appropriate methods (`self.id_product`, etc.).



**How to Use:**

```python
# ... (Your code to initialize the driver)

graber = Graber(driver)
product_id = "1234" # Replace with the actual product ID.
try:
    product_data = await graber.grab_page(driver, product_id)
    # Process product_data
except Exception as e:
    # Handle exceptions, perhaps log the error, or retry the request.
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


```

**Crucially**:  You **must** replace the placeholder `self._fetch_all_data` with code that appropriately fetches and assigns the data to `self.fields`.  This updated code correctly handles the decorator and error conditions. Remember to install `pydantic` if you haven't already.

This revised answer is more robust and directly addresses the original code's shortcomings, including correct decorator usage and comprehensive error handling.
