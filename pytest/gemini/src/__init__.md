**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Import Statements:** The tests now correctly import the necessary modules (`from hypotez.src import MODE`, `from hypotez.src import gs`).  Crucially, I've added a `import os` statement (though it's not used in this example, it's needed in some scenarios where you would need access to OS paths or similar).
2. **`test_credentials_import`:** This test verifies that the `gs` module from `credentials.py` is successfully imported.
3. **`test_mode_is_dev`:**  This test directly asserts the value of the `MODE` variable.
4. **Mocking and Exception Handling:** The example commented-out tests demonstrate how to handle a `ModuleNotFoundError` by mocking the `gs` module's functionality using `monkeypatch`. This is often necessary when testing functions that rely on external resources or modules.
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The provided tests are a starting point. You need to add tests for any functions, classes, or data structures defined within your `hypotez/src/__init__.py` file.  The examples show how to test these based on different structures.

**To run the tests:**

1. Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the above code as a Python file (e.g., `test_hypotez.py`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_hypotez.py`

**Critical for `hypotez/src/credentials.py`:**

- You **must** create a `hypotez/src/credentials.py` file with the `gs` module definition.  The tests won't work otherwise.  If you don't have an actual module you want to test, then replace the example `MockGS` class with a *useful* mock that demonstrates the functionality you'd like to test. This will enable the test `test_credentials_import` to run.


**Example `hypotez/src/credentials.py` (minimal):**

```python
# hypotez/src/credentials.py
# from google.cloud import storage  # Or whatever imports you need.
# Replace with your actual code and imports.
# gs = None
def create_gs():
    # Your actual gs initialization logic goes here
    # ...
    return "Example GS Object"
gs = create_gs()
```

This shows how the `gs` variable is now initialized in a way that isn't dependent on any outside inputs.  If there is logic for loading credentials you'll need to mock or replace them in your test cases.
