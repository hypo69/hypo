# Module: hypotez/src/webdriver/_pytest/test_driver.py

## Overview

This module contains unit tests for the `DriverBase` class, ensuring the correct functionality of methods related to web driver interactions and management.  The tests use `pytest` and `unittest.mock` for isolating the tested code from external dependencies like web pages and files.

## Classes

### `TestDriverBase`

**Description**: This class contains test methods for the `DriverBase` class.

**Methods**:

- `test_driver_payload`: Tests the `driver_payload` method, verifying that it correctly interacts with mock objects for JavaScript and executor functionalities.  Asserts that the expected methods from mock objects are called and the results are properly assigned.

- `test_scroll`: Tests the `scroll` method.  Assert that the correct `execute_script` calls are made with appropriate arguments based on the provided `direction` in scroll.

- `test_locale`: Tests the `locale` property.  Demonstrates testing scenarios where the meta tag for locale is found, and when it's not found. Asserts that the correct locale is obtained in both situations.

- `test_get_url`: Tests the `get_url` method.  Asserts that navigation to the new URL is performed and verifies the correct handling of the `previous_url` attribute.  Confirms that `_save_cookies_localy` is called as expected.

- `test_extract_domain`: Tests the `extract_domain` method.  Confirms that the expected domains are extracted from various URL formats.

- `test_save_cookies_localy`: Tests the `_save_cookies_localy` method.  Asserts that the function correctly opens the file in write binary mode, uses pickle to serialize the cookies data and writes it to the file.

- `test_page_refresh`: Tests the `page_refresh` method.  Verifies that `get_url` is called with the current URL to refresh the page.

- `test_wait`: Tests the `wait` method.  Verifies that the `time.sleep` function is called with the correct duration for the `wait` method.

- `test_delete_driver_logs`: Tests the `delete_driver_logs` method.  Confirms that it correctly identifies and deletes log files in the specified temporary directory.
