**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`PROJECT_DIR` constant:** Defines a constant for the project directory for easier testing and modification.  Crucially, this allows you to run tests in a different directory (like your test environment) without needing to change the tests.

* **`mock_open_settings_file` fixture:**  This is a significant improvement, allowing you to mock opening `settings.json` and avoid needing to create or modify the actual file for each test case.

* **`mock_gs_path` fixture:** Mocks the `gs.path` object (which is critical for the file loading).  This lets you control where the script thinks the `gs` directory is without actually changing the script's structure.

* **Clearer test names:**  Improved test names make it easier to understand the purpose of each test.

* **`pytest.raises` for exception handling:** Used correctly to test the `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions.

* **Explicit mocking of `open`:** Directly mocks `open()` to control file behavior without side effects and without reliance on `unittest.mock`. This is more stable for mocking a function that doesn't have specific requirements on the file object.

* **Tests for valid and invalid settings.json:** Includes a test specifically checking the loading from a valid `settings.json` file and one testing the handling of `FileNotFoundError`.

* **Tests for `README.MD` loading:** A test is added to check the handling of `README.MD`'s existence.

* **Corrected Path manipulation:** Uses correct path manipulation (e.g., `PROJECT_DIR / "src"`) for consistent results across different operating systems and test environments.


**How to use these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  **Replace `hypotez`:** Update `PROJECT_DIR` with the actual path to your `hypotez` project.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

This revised solution provides a more robust and maintainable set of tests that effectively cover the code's functionality, edge cases, and error handling. Remember to adapt the paths and fixture values to match your specific project structure.  Critically, if you are using an external module called `gs`, you must ensure the testing environment includes a correct mock for it, such as the `MockGS` class provided.
