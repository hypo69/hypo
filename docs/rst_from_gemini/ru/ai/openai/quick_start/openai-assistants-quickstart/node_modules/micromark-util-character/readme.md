This package provides utility functions for checking character codes against various sets, such as ASCII alphanumeric characters, punctuation, whitespace, etc.  It's designed to be used with [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark), a markdown parser.

## What is this?

This package exposes functions for efficiently determining if a given character code belongs to specific character classes (e.g., ASCII letters, punctuation).

## When should I use this?

You'll likely use this package when building custom extensions for micromark.  These functions help you define rules for how micromark handles different character types within your extensions.

## Install

This package is ESM only.

**Node.js (version 16+)**

```bash
npm install micromark-util-character
```

**Deno (with esm.sh)**

```typescript
import * as character from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-character@1';
```

**Browsers (with esm.sh)**

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as character from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-character@1?bundle';
</script>
```

## Use

```javascript
import { asciiAlpha } from 'micromark-util-character';

console.log(asciiAlpha(64)); // false
console.log(asciiAlpha(65)); // true
```

## API

### ASCII Character Checks

These functions check if a character code is part of specific ASCII character classes.

* `asciiAlpha(code)`: Checks for ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z).
* `asciiAlphanumeric(code)`: Checks for ASCII letters or digits (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
* `asciiAtext(code)`: Checks for ASCII characters conforming to the atext definition in RFC 5322.
* `asciiControl(code)`: Checks for ASCII control characters.
* `asciiDigit(code)`: Checks for ASCII digits (0-9).
* `asciiHexDigit(code)`: Checks for ASCII hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F).
* `asciiPunctuation(code)`: Checks for ASCII punctuation characters.


### Markdown Specific Checks

These functions are specifically tailored to micromark's markdown handling.

* `markdownLineEnding(code)`: Checks for newline characters (CR, LF, CRLF).
* `markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)`: Checks for newlines or spaces.
* `markdownSpace(code)`: Checks for spaces, tabs, and virtual spaces.

### Unicode Character Checks

These functions cover Unicode character classes.

* `unicodePunctuation(code)`: Checks for Unicode punctuation characters.
* `unicodeWhitespace(code)`: Checks for Unicode whitespace characters.  Note that it does *not* handle micromark's virtual whitespace.


## Types

This package is typed with TypeScript. No additional types are exported.

## Compatibility

## Security

This package is considered safe.  See the `security.md` file in the micromark repository for security reporting guidelines.
