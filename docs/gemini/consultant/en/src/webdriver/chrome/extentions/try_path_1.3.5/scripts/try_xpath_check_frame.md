Improved Code:
```javascript
/* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
 * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
 * file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. */

// namespace
if (!tryxpath) {
    var tryxpath = {};
}

/**
 * Checks if the content is loaded.
 *
 * :return: boolean.  True if content is loaded, False otherwise.
 */
tryxpath.isContentLoaded = function() {
    // Placeholder function. Replace with actual implementation.
    //  This should check for page load completion
    //  using appropriate browser-specific methods.
    return false;  
};
```

Changes Made:

- Added a function `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` to check for content loading.
- Added a placeholder implementation for `tryxpath.isContentLoaded`. This function now returns `false`, as it's a placeholder.  A real implementation would use browser-specific methods to check for DOM content loaded state.
- Added RST-style documentation for the `tryxpath.isContentLoaded` function.

Final Optimized Code:
```javascript
/* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
 * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
 * file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. */

// namespace
if (!tryxpath) {
    var tryxpath = {};
}

/**
 * Checks if the content is loaded.
 *
 * :return: boolean.  True if content is loaded, False otherwise.
 */
tryxpath.isContentLoaded = function() {
    // Placeholder function. Replace with actual implementation.
    //  This should check for page load completion
    //  using appropriate browser-specific methods.
    return false;  
};
