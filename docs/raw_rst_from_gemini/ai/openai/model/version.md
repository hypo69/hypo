**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`, printing an informative error message.  This is crucial for robustness.  The example shows how to log the error rather than just print it which is often better practice in production code.  Consider what your application should do in the event of a `settings.json` error.  Should it default to values? Should it crash?  It depends on the context.
* **Encoding:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to the `open()` function.  This is essential for handling files that might contain characters outside the ASCII range.  This prevents potential encoding errors.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `copyrihgnt` changed to `copyright` for better readability and consistency.
* **`get()` method:**  The code consistently uses `settings.get("key", default_value)` which is best practice for accessing dictionary keys.  This prevents `KeyError` exceptions if the key doesn't exist.
* **Explicit Default Handling for doc and details:**  Added `settings.get("doc", "")` and `settings.get("details", "")` to handle cases where those keys might not exist.  Empty strings are reasonable defaults.
* **Type Hinting:**  Added a type hint to `get_project_root` for better code readability and maintainability.  Also enforced that `get_project_root` returns a `Path` object, not a string. This is a best practice, making it more resilient to potential issues with string manipulations.

These changes significantly improve the code's robustness, readability, and maintainability, making it suitable for production environments. Remember to adjust error handling and default values to fit the specific needs of your application.  Logging errors is almost always a good idea.  Also consider handling cases where the entire settings file is malformed, which the current code doesn't account for.
