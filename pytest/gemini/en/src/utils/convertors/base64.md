```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`pytest.raises` for exceptions:** Correctly uses `pytest.raises` to test for expected exceptions (e.g., invalid Base64).
* **Clear test descriptions:** Test names now better explain the purpose of each test.
* **File Existence Verification:**  `os.path.exists(tmp_file_path)` is used to ensure the temporary file was created.
* **Empty Content Test:** Added a test case specifically for handling empty Base64 input.
* **Data validation:** Ensures that the decoded content matches the original input.
* **Error Handling:**  Handles cases where the input isn't valid Base64 correctly using `pytest.raises` and the `base64.binascii.Error`  exception type.
* **`tmp_file_path` Fixture:** Introduced a fixture that handles creating and cleaning up temporary files to eliminate issues with file cleanup and test isolation.
* **Multiple Extension Test:** Added a test to verify that different file extensions are correctly handled in the temporary file naming.
* **Robustness:** The tests now explicitly check that the temporary file has the expected content and that the temporary file is correctly deleted after the test.


This improved solution addresses potential issues and provides more comprehensive test coverage.  Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```
