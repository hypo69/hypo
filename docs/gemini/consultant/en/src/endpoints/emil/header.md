```
## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`
- Added missing import `from src.logger import logger`
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for JSON loading.
- Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) to the `set_project_root` function following the RST standard.
- Implemented `load_settings` and `load_readme` functions for better code organization and error handling.
- Changed `gs.path.root` to `PROJECT_ROOT` for consistency and clarity.
- Improved error handling with `logger.error` for better debugging.
- Included comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) for all functions and variables for better code documentation.
