How to use the __init__.py file in the prestashop examples
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This file (`hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/_examples/__init__.py`) appears to be an initialization file for a module related to PrestaShop endpoints.  It likely defines constants, imports necessary packages, and potentially defines version information for the PrestaShop example code.  The multiple use of triple-quoted string documentation suggests that this is a way to provide metadata about the module for use in documentation generators.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Imports Necessary Packages:** The code imports the `Version` class from the `packaging.version` module and variables (`__version__`, `__doc__`, `__details__`) from a file named `.version`. This suggests the code might handle versioning and potentially documentation for the PrestaShop endpoints.

2. **Defines a Constant:** The code defines a constant named `MODE` and sets its value to 'dev'. This likely controls the operational mode (e.g., development, production) for the associated PrestaShop functions.

3. **Handles Metadata:**  Multiple multiline strings within triple quotes seem to be intended for use by documentation generation tools to document the code's purpose and platform compatibility.  These comments would appear as a description in the documentation.

4. **Additional Imports:** The code also imports necessary external modules, such as versioning libraries.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming the necessary modules are installed and the .version file is present)
    from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples import MODE

    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
    else:
        print("Running in production mode.")
