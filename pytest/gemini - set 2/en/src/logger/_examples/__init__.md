#     if 'platform' in __details__:
#         assert isinstance(__details['platform'], (list, tuple, str))

#  from the `__details__` dictionary.  Thoroughly test the structure of `__details__` in case it has multiple types of values.


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:** The test function names now clearly describe the purpose of each test.

2. **Specific Assertions:** The tests now use `isinstance()` to verify the expected data types of `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` and other specific checks for expected keys.

3. **Edge Case (and potential error handling):** Tests for `__details__` now include checks to verify it's a dictionary and contains expected keys (`'version'`, `'description'`). The added `try...except` block catches `KeyError` if a key is missing, preventing the test from failing silently.  Importantly,  it *won't pass* the test if there are key-value pairs that aren't expected.

4. **Comprehensive Tests:** The tests cover various aspects, including type checking, presence of data, and edge cases.

5. **Adaptability:** The `test_details_contains_keys` example now demonstrates how you can easily adapt the tests if the structure or content of `__details__` changes.


**Crucial Next Steps:**

* **Analyze `__details__`:** Carefully examine the structure of the `__details__` dictionary to add more specific assertions about the values associated with its keys, ensuring the tests comprehensively cover the expected structure and data types.
* **Error Handling:**  If `__details__` can be empty or contain unusual data types, enhance the tests to handle these scenarios properly.


This revised solution addresses the issues and provides a more robust and adaptable test suite for your code. Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the test functions with actual assertions based on the expected data types and values in your `__details__` dictionary. Remember to review and update the tests as the codebase evolves.
