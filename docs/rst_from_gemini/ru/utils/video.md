Video Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions for downloading and saving video files,
as well as retrieving video data.  It includes robust error handling and logging
for reliable operation.

Functions:
    save_video_from_url(url: str, save_path: str) -> Optional[Path]:
        Download a video from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles
        potential network issues, file saving errors, and empty downloads.

    get_video_data(file_name: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        Retrieve binary data of a video file if it exists.  Handles file not found
        and read errors.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_video_from_url("https://www.example.com/sample.mp4", "myvideo.mp4"))
    PosixPath('myvideo.mp4')  # or None if failed
    >>> data = get_video_data("myvideo.mp4")
    >>> if data:
    ...     print(data[:10])  # Print first 10 bytes to check

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** More robust error handling with specific exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`). Crucial addition of `save_path.unlink()` if the download fails or the file is empty.  This prevents leaving incomplete files.  Added `timeout` to `session.get` to prevent indefinite hangs on slow or unresponsive servers.
* **Clearer Docstrings:** Docstrings are improved for better readability and clarity, specifying potential errors. Added examples with valid URLs to be used for testing.
* **Empty File Handling:** Now explicitly checks and handles the case where the downloaded file is empty. Empty files are deleted.
* **Timeout:**  Added a timeout to the `aiohttp.ClientSession` to prevent the program from getting stuck if the video server is unresponsive. A 60-second timeout is a good starting point but might need adjustment depending on your expected download times.
* **Logging:** Consistent use of `logger` for logging errors.
* **Import `FileNotFoundError`:**  Added the `import FileNotFoundError` line as it's needed for the specific `except FileNotFoundError` block.


**How to Use/Test:**

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp aiofiles
   ```
2. **Create a `src/logger.py` file:**  (This is not included in the example, but crucial)


   ```python
   import logging

   # Configure your logger
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Or logging.DEBUG for more details
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


   # ... (rest of your logger code if needed)
   ```
3. **Replace `"https://www.example.com/sample.mp4"`:** with a valid video URL.
4. **Run:**
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

This revised code is more robust and less prone to unexpected behavior, providing a better experience for users. Remember to adapt the `url` to a valid video URL for testing purposes. Remember to have a properly setup logger.
