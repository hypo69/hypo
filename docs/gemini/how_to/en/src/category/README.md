# Usage Guide for the Data Categorization Module (Product Class)

This module allows for categorizing data (`Product`) received from a `Supplier`.  The core class is `Product`.

## Core Classes

* **`Supplier`**: Represents a data source (e.g., a supplier).  This class likely has methods for retrieving data.

* **`Product`**: Represents a piece of data received from a `Supplier`. This class is the focus of categorization.


## How to Use the `Product` Class

This section details how to utilize the `Product` class to categorize data.  Please provide the relevant Python code (e.g., class definitions) for a complete guide.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
# Example Supplier class (replace with your actual class)
class Supplier:
    def get_products(self):
        # Replace this with your actual data retrieval logic.
        return [
            {'name': 'Product A', 'category': 'Electronics'},
            {'name': 'Product B', 'category': 'Clothing'},
            {'name': 'Product C', 'category': 'Electronics'},
        ]

# Example Product class (replace with your actual class)
class Product:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def categorize(self):
        # Implement your categorization logic here.  
        # Example: Based on the 'category' key in the 'data' dictionary.
        if 'category' in self.data:
            return self.data['category']
        else:
            return 'Uncategorized'

# Example usage:
supplier = Supplier()
products = supplier.get_products()

for product_data in products:
    product = Product(product_data)
    category = product.categorize()
    print(f"Product: {product_data['name']}, Category: {category}")
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

1. The `Supplier` class fetches product data.  You'll need to replace this with your actual data retrieval methods.
2. The `Product` class stores the product data.
3. The `categorize` method is crucial.  It must contain the logic for determining the product category.  The example uses a simple check for the `category` key; adapt this for more complex categorization rules.
4. The example code iterates over the products returned by the supplier and prints the product name and its determined category.


## Important Considerations

* **Data Structure:** Ensure the `data` received from the `Supplier` is in a consistent format, allowing the `Product` class to extract the necessary information.
* **Categorization Logic:**  Carefully design the logic within the `Product.categorize()` method.  This may involve complex rules, external data sources, or machine learning models.  Provide details in the module's documentation for a clear explanation.
* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to catch cases where data is missing or in an unexpected format.
