hypotez/src/_examples/quick_start.py

Quick start to `hypotez`.  This file serves as a basic example
demonstrating how to use the hypotez library.

Detailed explanation of the intended use cases, including:

*   How to initialize the hypotez object.
*   How to define datasets and models.
*   How to perform calculations and analysis.
*   How to visualize results.

Example usage and expected output should be included.

    """
    Example function for demonstrating use cases of the library.  
    This example placeholder should be replaced with actual code
    that demonstrates the library's functionality in the context of 
    a quick start.

**Explanation of Improvements and Rationale:**

* **Docstring Enhancement:**  The docstring is significantly expanded to describe the purpose of the file and the expected use cases. It now explicitly encourages users to add a detailed explanation of how to use the library, showing how to initialize objects, define datasets and models, perform calculations and analysis, and visualize results.  Crucially, it includes a placeholder for actual usage examples.  The original docstring was too brief and unhelpful.

* **Example Function:** Added a placeholder function `example_function` to illustrate the structure of how code examples would be included.  This is essential for a "quick start" guide.  The placeholder `# ...` indicates where the actual implementation of the hypotez library usage should go.

* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This is standard Python practice. It ensures that the `example_function` is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

* **File Header:** Maintained the file header, but now it's more informative.

This improved version now provides a much more useful and instructive template for a quick start guide to the `hypotez` library.  It guides the developer toward creating a comprehensive example, filling in the missing sections with actual hypotez usage code, as part of this initial step. Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with the actual code that demonstrates how to use the `hypotez` library.
