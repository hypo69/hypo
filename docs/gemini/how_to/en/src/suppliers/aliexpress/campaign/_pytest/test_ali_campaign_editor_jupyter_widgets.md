**Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Docstrings:**  Added comprehensive docstrings to each test function.  These docstrings now clearly explain what the test is supposed to do, the arguments, the example usage, and the purpose of the function being tested. This is crucial for maintainability and understanding.
* **Return Values:** The `test_read_text_file` function now returns the `content` read from the file (as was requested in the example).  The other tests were modified to not have a return statement.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names and formatting for better code readability.
* **`header` Module:** Added a placeholder comment `# Assuming this is a module you defined in the src folder` for the `import header` line.  This clarifies that you're importing from a module *you* created, indicating a missing part of the context.  This is often an essential piece to testing code.
* **Assertions:**  `test_save_text_file` now has an important assertion that verifies `mock_mkdir` was called once. This ensures the function correctly handles directory creation (if needed).
* **Example Usage:**  Updated example usage in the docstrings to illustrate how to call and use the functions being tested.


**How to Run These Tests:**

Assuming you have `pytest` installed, you can run these tests from your terminal using:

```bash
pytest hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_pytest/test_ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets.py
```

This will execute the tests and report the results.  Remember to replace `"hypotez/src/..."` with the actual path to your project if it's different.  Importantly, you'll need a `src.utils.file.file` module to run this test correctly.  This example is complete in that it would work if you filled in the rest of that module.
