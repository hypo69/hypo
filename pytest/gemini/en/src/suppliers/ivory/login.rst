```python
import pytest
import hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.login as login

# No functions or classes are present in the provided code.
#  Therefore, no tests can be written.

# Example of how to write tests if there was code present:
# Example Code (replace with your actual code)
# def some_function(input_data):
#     if input_data == "valid":
#         return "success"
#     elif input_data is None:
#         raise ValueError("Input cannot be None")
#     else:
#         raise ValueError("Invalid input")

# Example Tests (replace with your actual tests)
# def test_some_function_valid_input():
#     assert some_function("valid") == "success"
# 
# def test_some_function_invalid_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid input"):
#         some_function("invalid")
# 
# def test_some_function_none_input():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Input cannot be None"):
#         some_function(None)
# 
# # Example Fixture (replace with your actual fixture if needed)
# @pytest.fixture
# def example_data():
#     return {"input": "valid"}
# 
# def test_some_function_with_fixture(example_data):
#     assert some_function(example_data["input"]) == "success"
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Code Provided:** The input code (`hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/login.py`) is completely empty.  You *must* provide the Python code you want tested.  These example tests are placeholder.

2. **Testing Structure:** The provided example structure is a good guide.  Always:
   - Define test functions with clear names (`test_function_name`).
   - Use `pytest.raises` to test for specific exceptions.
   - Include assertions (`assert`) to check the expected return values.
   - Write tests for various cases (valid, invalid, edge).
   - Use fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`) for reusable setup if needed (e.g., creating test data).

3. **Crucial: The Actual Code:**  Without the `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/login.py` file content, the tests are useless.  Provide the Python code for testing.  This will allow generation of appropriate and accurate tests.

4. **Error Handling:** If the code raises exceptions, test those exceptions using `pytest.raises()`.  The `match` argument is highly recommended for more specific exception checking:

```python
with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Input cannot be None"):
    my_function(None) 
```

5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** Consider all possible inputs and states that your function might encounter, and test them thoroughly.


**How to Run the Tests (Assuming the code is added):**

1. Save the test code (e.g., `test_login.py`) in the same directory as the `login.py` file.
2. Run `pytest test_login.py` from your terminal.  Pytest will discover and run the test functions.

Remember to replace the example code and tests with the actual code from `hypotez/src/suppliers/ivory/login.py` to create meaningful tests.
