This Python script defines header information for a project, sets the project root directory, loads settings from a JSON file, and retrieves documentation.

**Usage Guide:**

This `header.py` script is a crucial initialization file for your project. It establishes the project's root path and essential variables like project name, version, author, and documentation.

**How to use it:**

1. **Project Structure:** Ensure your project directory structure includes a `src` directory containing a `settings.json` file and an optional `README.MD` file (for documentation).  The example provided assumes this structure:

```
myproject/
├── src/
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── ... (your code)
│   └── README.MD
└── ... (other project files)
```

2. **Import and Initialization:**  Import the `header.py` file in other Python modules within your project:

```python
from hypotez.src.bots import header  # Replace 'hypotez' with your project name
```

This will execute the initialization code within `header.py` and populate the global variables like `__root__`, `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.

3. **Accessing Variables:** Access the project root path and other variables from anywhere in your project:

```python
import hypotez.src.bots.header as header # Import header directly
project_root = header.__root__
project_name = header.__project_name__
# ...use the variables as needed
```


**Explanation of the Code:**

* **`set_project_root()`:** This function finds the root directory of your project by searching upwards from the current file's location.  It looks for specific marker files (like `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git`) to pinpoint the project's base.  This is important for correctly importing modules from different levels of the directory structure.

* **Project Root Path:** The root path is saved as `__root__` which is critical for correctly importing all modules.  Crucially, the project path is added to `sys.path` to allow correct module loading.

* **Settings Loading:** The code attempts to load settings from a `settings.json` file located in the `src` directory under the project root. This JSON file should contain project-specific configurations.

* **Documentation Loading:**  It attempts to load documentation from a `README.MD` file in the `src` directory under the project root for easy reference.

* **Global Variables:**  Importantly, these global variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, etc.) are made accessible in modules across your project, which can then be used for various tasks like generating project documentation or including specific information.  Default values are set to handle cases where files might be missing.


**Example settings.json:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "copyright": "2024, My Company"
}
```

**Example README.MD:**
```markdown
# My Awesome Project
A brief description of the project.
```

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks now handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` exceptions when loading settings and documentation, preventing the program from crashing.


This revised guide provides a comprehensive explanation of how to use `header.py`, its purpose, and the crucial role it plays in your project structure.  It addresses the initial concerns about proper file handling and variable access. Remember to replace `"hypotez"` with your project's actual name. Remember to tailor the marker files in `set_project_root()` to your specific project structure.
