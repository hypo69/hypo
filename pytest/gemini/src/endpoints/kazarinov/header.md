```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now effectively mock the `gs` module and the file operations using `@patch`. This is crucial for isolating the `set_project_root` function from external dependencies and creating reproducible test environments.

2. **Fixtures for Data:**  Fixtures like `settings_file_content`, `mock_settings_file`, and `mock_readme_file` are introduced to manage test data efficiently. This improves code organization and readability.  The `mock_settings_file` fixture now creates a temporary JSON file for the settings, making the tests much more robust.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover scenarios with valid files, edge cases (no marker files, empty marker files), and exception handling (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError).

4. **Correct use of `pytest.raises`:** Added `pytest.raises` for exception handling in the cases of invalid JSON and `FileNotFoundError`.

5. **Clearer Test Names:** Test function names (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`, `test_set_project_root_no_marker_file`) are more informative about the tested scenario.

6. **Reproducibility:** The tests are more isolated and more likely to provide reliable results due to the use of temporary files within `tmp_path`.

7. **Import `sys`:** Added `import sys` to the test file so that it can use `sys.path.insert` in the tests.

8. **Import `Path`:** Made sure that `from pathlib import Path` was imported, which is necessary to use `Path` objects.

9. **Explicit type hints:** Added type hints to the `set_project_root` function signature to improve readability and maintainability.


This revised solution provides a more robust and thorough test suite for the `set_project_root` function, addressing the issues and limitations of the previous version. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `packaging`, `json`, `pathlib`) if you haven't already.


```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
