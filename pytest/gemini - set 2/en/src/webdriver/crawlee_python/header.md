```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures:** Added `example_settings_file` and `example_readme_file` fixtures to create temporary test files containing sample data, making the tests more robust. This avoids cluttering the tests with file creation and removal logic.

2. **Error Handling:** Used `pytest.raises` for testing `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` to validate exception handling in the header.py code.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, improving readability and understanding.

4. **Mocking:** Instead of relying on the actual filesystem, `tmp_path` from `pytest` is used for creating temporary directories and files. This is better for testing as it isolates the tests from the actual file system.

5. **`gs` Object:** The code now correctly uses the `gs` object in the test to properly mock the `root` attribute of the `gs.path` object, which is crucial to ensure the expected behavior.

6. **Complete Test Coverage:** The tests now cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, the case where the marker file is in the parent directory, cases with no marker files, and cases where marker files are present in multiple directories. Importantly, tests are added to cover situations where the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files are not present.

7. **Type Checking:** The tests ensure the returned value from `set_project_root()` is a `Path` object, making the code more robust.


**To run the tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_header.py`) in the same directory as your `header.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the project directory.

This revised solution provides comprehensive test coverage, isolates the tests effectively, and uses the `tmp_path` fixture from `pytest` for creating temporary files/directories, making the tests more robust and maintainable. Remember to replace `"temp_settings.json"` and `"temp_readme.md"` with appropriate file names when running the tests. Remember to adjust the test paths if your project structure is different.
