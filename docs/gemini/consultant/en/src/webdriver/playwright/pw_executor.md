```

## Changes Made

- Added necessary imports: `json`, `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`, and `logger` from `src.logger`.
- Added RST-style docstrings for the module and the `execute_playwright_test` function, including type hints, error handling descriptions, and usage examples.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for reading the configuration file, handling potential errors.
- Improved error handling using `logger.error` to log exceptions and propagate them as needed, reducing the use of bare `try-except` blocks.
- Added more descriptive comments (# comments) to explain the steps involved in the function, enhancing readability.
