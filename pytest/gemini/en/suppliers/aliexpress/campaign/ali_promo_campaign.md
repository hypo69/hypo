**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the tests now use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock external functions (e.g., `get_filenames`, `extract_prod_ids`, `read_text_file`, `get_directory_names`) and methods. This isolates the tests from the external dependencies and avoids potential side effects.  Mocking `asyncio` and `Future` correctly is more complex and needs a better approach depending on how you actually use those (using a `mock_return_value` to return a `Future` object).


2. **Clearer Test Cases:** The tests are more descriptive, outlining the expected behavior and checking the relevant parts of the code.


3. **Edge Case Handling:** The tests now explicitly cover cases where input files might be missing or empty, which were missing in the original tests.


4. **Exception Handling:**  The original code had some exception handling. I added a test for `test_ali_promo_campaign_process_campaign_no_products` to check for `None` return from `process_category_products`. I also incorporated error checking into the tests where necessary.


5. **Asyncio Considerations:**  Testing asynchronous functions with `pytest` requires a specific approach. I provided an example (commented out).  You'll need to use proper mocking for `asyncio` and `Future` objects to test `generate_output`.


6. **Correct `@patch` Usage:** The `@patch` decorators are correctly used to patch the functions of the class.


7. **Data Setup and Teardown:** I added temporary file creation using `j_dumps`. This creates the actual file, ensuring the test works correctly on the file creation part.


8. **Complete Example:** I included more comprehensive examples of how to use `@patch`, `pytest.raises`, and mocking in the example tests.


**Important Considerations for Asyncio:**

- **Asynchronous Testing:**  Testing asynchronous code requires careful handling of `asyncio` events and `Future` objects.  Mock `asyncio.run` to return a `Future` object.


- **`pytest.mark.asyncio`:** Use this decorator to mark tests that run with `asyncio`.


- **Event Loop:**  The tests need to run inside an event loop, otherwise the asynchronous functions will not be executed.  This generally involves mocking the asyncio event loop.


- **`asyncio.run` mocking:**  You need to mock `asyncio.run` correctly to avoid problems with real asyncio loop starting.  A good mocking pattern using `Future` object is recommended for testing async functions.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Place the provided code (`ali_promo_campaign.py`) and the tests in the same directory.
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest`

Remember to replace placeholders (`/path/to/your/code`) with the actual paths.  Adjust the mocking patterns for the async functions according to how you use the `asyncio` library in your actual code. Remember that if your `AliPromoCampaign` class directly interacts with file system in certain situations, then patching the file system interaction is the best method to avoid unintended consequences (as files might get overwritten).


This revised solution provides a more robust and complete set of tests for the `AliPromoCampaign` class, addressing the issues in the original response.
