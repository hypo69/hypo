# These tests check for correct types, but not the expected values.
#  It's highly unlikely that __annotations__ or other attributes
#  will have specific values that would be important to test.


#  Important Note:  The `__annotations__` attribute is typically not something
#  that you would test in a simple versioning module like this.  Type
#  annotations are often used in function definitions to specify expected
#  types for arguments and return values.

# Also note the comment in test_name_value; it's impossible to
#  test the contents of __name__ or __doc__ without more specific
#  information or direct execution of the module.
