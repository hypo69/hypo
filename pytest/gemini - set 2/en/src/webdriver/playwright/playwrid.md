**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures for Data:**  Crucially, `mock_settings_file` and `custom_settings_file` fixtures now create temporary JSON files. This avoids hardcoding file paths and makes tests more robust (and avoids accidentally modifying existing files).
* **Mocking `super().run()`:**  The `test_playwrid_start` test now uses `monkeypatch` to mock `super().run()`. This is essential because running the Playwright browser is slow and unnecessary for testing the `Playwrid` class itself.
* **Comprehensive Exception Handling:** The `test_playwrid_start_exception` test demonstrates exception handling.  It uses `pytest.raises` to check that a `FileNotFoundError` is correctly raised when the settings file is not found. This tests the error handling in the `_load_settings` function.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names like `test_playwrid_init_valid_settings` and `test_playwrid_load_settings_no_custom` are more descriptive and easier to understand.
* **Import Corrections:** The code now imports the correct modules (`hypotez.src`, `crawlee.playwright_crawler`, etc.).
* **Using `monkeypatch` Correctly:** The `monkeypatch` is used to mock the `PlaywrightCrawler.run` method.
* **Import `os` (if needed):** The `os` module is added to the imports.  It's good practice for path handling.

This revised solution is much more robust and effective at testing the `Playwrid` class without requiring an external Playwright environment. Remember to install `pytest` and `pytest-mock` if you haven't already.

pip install pytest pytest-mock
