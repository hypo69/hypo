```python
import pytest

# Replace with actual code from hypotez/src/endpoints/__init__.py
# Example (replace with your code):



def test_mode_is_dev():
    """Tests that the MODE variable is set to 'dev'."""
    assert MODE == 'dev'


def test_mode_is_not_prod():
    """Tests that MODE is NOT 'prod' (useful for ensuring proper defaults)."""
    assert MODE != 'prod'


# Example testing for potential imports (if present)
# You'll need to adapt these tests if imports are different
# def test_imports():
#     from .prestashop import PrestaShop  # Example import
#     assert PrestaShop  # Check if the class exists

# Example to test for exception handling (if applicable)
# def test_invalid_mode():
#     with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
#         MODE = 'invalid'
#     assert "Invalid mode" in str(excinfo.value)  # or any error message
#     # Add more assertions as necessary for your exception handling
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Missing Code:**  The provided code from `hypotez/src/endpoints/__init__.py` is empty.  The test cases above are *example* tests.  You *must* replace the placeholder comments (`# Example...`) with the actual code from your file.


2. **Understanding the Code:**  Thorough testing requires a deep understanding of the code you are testing.  Consider these points in your testing:

   * **Variables:** Do you have any other variables that could be tested (e.g., `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`)?
   * **Functions:** What functions do you have?  What are their inputs and outputs?  What exceptions might they raise?
   * **Classes:**  Do you have classes?  What methods do they have?  What are their attributes?  Do they require initialization?
   * **Imports:**  If the file imports other modules, make sure to test the imports themselves (e.g., `from .prestashop import PrestaShop`).



3. **Example `test_invalid_mode`:** This test demonStartes how to use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.  You will need to adapt it based on the actual exceptions your code might throw.


4. **Realistic Test Data:**  Example tests often use placeholder data. In your actual tests, use data that closely resembles the real-world data expected by your code.


5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**  As the prompt mentions, test with boundary conditions (e.g., very large numbers, very small values, empty lists, empty strings).


6. **Use `pytest` Fixtures:** If you need to use common data in multiple tests, use `pytest` fixtures. This will be crucial for testing functions that depend on external resources.


7. **Comprehensive Tests:**  Make sure your tests cover all relevant scenarios. Test valid inputs, various edge cases (like invalid data types, unexpected input values), boundary conditions (the maximum or minimum value for numeric inputs), and error cases where exceptions should be raised.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_endpoints.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
3. Run the tests from your terminal:
   ```bash
   pytest test_endpoints.py
   ```


This expanded response provides a more realistic and practical approach to writing `pytest` tests, accounting for the potential lack of code in the initial prompt. Remember to replace the examples with your actual code. Remember to replace the placeholder comments and import statements with your actual code and requirements. Always strive for comprehensive test coverage.
