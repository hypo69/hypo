**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** Added necessary imports (`pytest`, `sys`, `os`, `Path`).

2. **`test_mode_is_dev`:** A simple test to verify the `MODE` constant.

3. **`test_root_path_exists`:** Checks if the calculated root path actually exists.  Crucially, it now handles potential errors related to incorrect paths or project structures better.

4. **`test_root_path_correct_construction`:**  This is significantly improved. It now creates a simulated project directory structure to test the logic of the path calculation.  It also uses `Path` objects for cleaner and more robust path comparisons. The most important improvement here is simulating the scenario where the current directory is *within* the 'hypotez' directory.


5. **`test_root_path_handles_no_hypotez`:** Added a test to ensure the code gracefully handles cases where 'hypotez' is not present in the path.

6. **`test_root_path_append_to_sys_path`:** Added a test to ensure that the calculated root path is actually appended to `sys.path`, addressing a potential error that wasn't clear in the previous version. This test now uses a more sophisticated approach.


7. **Error Handling (Crucial):** The tests now include `try...except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` or other exceptions that might occur during file system operations, preventing the tests from failing prematurely. This is a critical aspect of robust test writing.

8. **Directory Cleanup:** Added code to clean up the test directory created by the `test_root_path_correct_construction` test. This prevents accidental pollution of the test environment.

**How to run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
3. Run the tests from the command line: `pytest test_header.py`


This revised solution is significantly more robust and comprehensive, addressing potential issues and providing more accurate testing for the provided code. Remember to adjust the directory paths if your project structure differs. Remember to replace `hypotez` with the correct name of your project.  Always thoroughly simulate the various situations that could arise in a real-world environment.
