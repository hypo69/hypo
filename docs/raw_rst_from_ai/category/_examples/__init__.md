from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__

```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

The original code had several redundant and potentially confusing lines:

* **`## \file ...` and `""" ... """` blocks:**  These are largely redundant and likely meant for documentation generation tools like Sphinx.  Sphinx handles file and module docstrings independently. Removing them simplifies the code and reduces clutter.
* **Multiple blank lines:** Excessive blank lines don't add functionality and just make the code less readable.

The revised code:

1. **Focuses on Python code:**  The code is now pure Python, without extraneous markdown-style comments.
2. **Clearer module docstring:** The `""" module: src.category._examples """` line is a single, clear docstring that properly documents the module's purpose.
3. **Correct use of `"""`:** The triple-quoted strings are now correctly used for docstrings, which are essential for documenting Python code.

**Important Considerations (for a complete docstring):**

The provided code snippet imports `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from a `.version` file.  To generate proper documentation, you need the content of that `.version` file.  For example, `.version` might look like this:

```python
__version__ = Version("1.0.0")
__doc__ = "Documentation for this example category"
__details__ = {"author": "Example Author"}
```

By including a good `.version` file, you would properly document the module, its version, documentation, and any other details needed.


**Example of how this would be used in a larger project (with proper `.version` file):**

```python
# ... (in src/category/_examples/__init__.py)
from packaging.version import Version
from .version import __version__, __doc__, __details__

# In a docstring (e.g., for a function or class)
def example_function():
    """
    This is an example function in the _examples category.

    :return:
    """
    # ... function code ...
    return True


# Example usage in a doc generation tool (like Sphinx)
# (this is not Python code, but an example showing how Sphinx might process this)
# ... some documentation generation ...
```

Without the `.version` content, Sphinx or other doc generators will show empty placeholders for `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` in the output documentation.  So, make sure to create the `.version` file with the proper information. Remember to keep the `__version__` and `__doc__` updated with appropriate values. Also, add appropriate docstrings for functions, classes, etc. as examples in this `.version` file if there are any.
