**Explanation:**

The provided input is a prompt for generating "how to" documentation for code blocks, not the code itself.  To provide the "Improved Code" and "Optimized Code," a code block needs to be included in the `input_code`.  The response has been updated to reflect this and to correctly format the requested markdown.
