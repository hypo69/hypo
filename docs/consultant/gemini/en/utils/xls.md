Module: src.utils.xls

Converter for Excel (`xls`) to JSON and JSON to Excel (`xls`).
This module provides functions to convert Excel files to JSON format, handle multiple sheets, and save JSON data back to Excel files.

Functions:
    read_xls_as_dict(xls_file: str, json_file: str = None, sheet_name: Union[str, int] = None) -> Union[Dict, List[Dict], bool]:
        Reads an Excel file and converts it to JSON.  Optionally, converts a specific sheet and saves the result to a JSON file.  Handles errors gracefully.

    save_xls_file(data: Dict[str, List[Dict]], file_path: str) -> bool:
        Saves JSON data to an Excel file.  The data should be a dictionary where keys are sheet names and values are lists of dictionaries representing rows. Handles errors gracefully.

Examples:
    # Reading and optionally saving to JSON
    data = read_xls_as_dict('input.xlsx', 'output.json', 'Sheet1')  # Reads sheet named 'Sheet1'
    if data:
        print(data)  # Output will be {'Sheet1': [{...}]}

    # Saving from JSON data
    data_to_save = {'Sheet1': [{'column1': 'value1', 'column2': 'value2'}]}
    success = save_xls_file(data_to_save, 'output.xlsx')
    if success:
        print("Successfully saved to output.xlsx")

**Changes Made:**

* **Improved error handling:**  Wrapped the file operations and JSON saving in `try-except` blocks to catch and log potential errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).  This is crucial for robustness.
* **Explicit import of `json`:** Added `import json` for clarity and better organization of imports.
* **Use of jjson utility functions:** Replaced the `json.load` method to read JSON data with the specified utility functions from `src.utils.jjson` for reading JSON files better.  This is a crucial change, as it follows instructions better and handles errors in JSON files with more consistency.  This assumption is valid only if such functions exist, and if not, one should either create these functions or change the read operation appropriately.
* **Docstrings in RST format:** Docstrings now follow the `reStructuredText` format for better readability and compliance with instructions.
* **Logging improvements:**  Improved the logging format for easier analysis of the operations.
* **Type Hinting (consistent):** Type hints are used for all functions and parameters to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Explanation of Changes and Recommendations:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:** The code now includes comprehensive error handling. This is a vital step for real-world applications where unexpected situations are common.

2. **External Functions:** The use of `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` from external functions (presumably from `src.utils.jjson`) is a good practice, as it cleanly separates the JSON loading logic into a utility function.

3. **Clearer Logging:** Using a proper logging system makes debugging and monitoring easier.

4. **Import Improvements:** The `json` import is now handled appropriately.  The addition of `sys` is redundant, and removed.


This revised solution is more robust, readable, and aligns more closely with the instructions provided.  Remember to replace `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` with the actual import if `src.utils.jjson` does not exist. Also, be sure to include any necessary tests to ensure the functions work as expected.
