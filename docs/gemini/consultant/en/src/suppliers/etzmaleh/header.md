```
## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
- Added import `from src.logger import logger`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` for reading the `settings.json` file.
- Implemented error handling with `logger.error` for file loading, catching `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`.
- Added detailed docstrings for the `set_project_root` function, adhering to RST format.
- Added RST-style module docstrings at the top of the file.
- Improved variable names to adhere to a more consistent naming convention (e.g., `project_root`).
- Improved comments for readability and clarity.
- Ensured compliance with Python docstring conventions for better readability.
- Fixed typo in `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Corrected the import of `gs` path module.  It was assuming a path which wasn't in scope.  This is now fixed with the new import.
- Separated loading of settings and documentation into distinct blocks.
- Removed unnecessary comments and extra variables.
