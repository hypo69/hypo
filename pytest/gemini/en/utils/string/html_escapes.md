# Test cases for potential edge or boundary cases in your dictionary
# In this example, the code is directly using a dictionary, not a function,
# so the `edge_cases` fixture is not strictly needed.
# Uncomment if you have further edge cases related to the dictionary.



#  Add more tests as necessary for different categories of characters
# and potential issues with the data. For example, you might test cases
# where you have special characters, symbols, unicode characters.
# Consider testing values with unicode characters not mentioned above.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Test Names:**  Test names clearly indicate the purpose (e.g., `test_valid_html_escape`, `test_invalid_html_escape`).

2. **Explicit Error Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to check for `KeyError` and `TypeError` for invalid inputs.  This is crucial for robust testing.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes tests for valid inputs (`&`, '<', 'á' etc.), checking both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.

4. **Edge Case Testing:** Includes tests for an empty key (`""`) and a non-string key (123) to cover potential issues that might not be obvious when using a dictionary.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code (e.g., `test_html_escapes.py`) in the same directory as your `html_escapes.py` file.
2.  **Run:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory, and run `pytest test_html_escapes.py`.

This improved test suite provides a much better way to verify the functionality and robustness of the `html_escapes` dictionary. Remember to adapt the test cases based on the actual content and potential issues within your `html_escapes` dictionary.  If you had more complex logic (e.g., a function that uses this dictionary), the test suite would need to be adjusted to reflect the function's behavior.
