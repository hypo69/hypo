**Changes and explanations:**

* **Docstrings:** Added a module-level docstring (`"""..."""`) explaining the purpose of the `src.translators` module.  This is crucial for documentation. The previous docstring (`__doc__`) was empty, which is unhelpful.
* **Removed unnecessary comments:** The comments like `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` and `#! venv/Scripts/python.exe` are generally handled by the interpreter and IDE and can usually be removed for cleaner code.  (If you're using a non-standard interpreter setting, it's fine to leave them in that context.)
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `__version__` instead of `__version__: str =` is standard Python style.

This revised version is more readable, follows Python conventions, and provides better documentation.  The docstrings make it clear what the purpose of the module is, without needing separate explanation comments. Remember to include the file path for clarity when necessary, but internal comments like the one related to the Python executable path aren't necessary here if the interpreter/environment is correctly set up.
