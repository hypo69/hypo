```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now mocks the `build` function. This is essential because the original code makes real API calls. Mocking prevents these real calls, which could fail or take time, and allows testing in isolation.


* **`mock_build` Fixture:** This fixture now correctly sets up the mock for `build`.


* **`google_drive_handler` Fixture:**  This fixture creates a `GoogleDriveHandler` instance *with the mocked build*. This is very important for testing the `upload_file` method properly.


* **`test_create_credentials`:**  This test verifies that `_create_credentials` creates `Credentials` object and also checks for the existence of the token.pickle file. It correctly mocks the `gs.path` for testing.


* **`test_upload_file`:** This test now correctly mocks the `build` function and creates a dummy file for testing purposes.


* **`test_upload_file_invalid_file`:** Added a test case to check if a `FileNotFoundError` is raised when the file doesn't exist.


* **Error Handling:** The tests now use `pytest.raises` for checking expected exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).


* **File Cleanup:**  The dummy file `test_file.txt` is now deleted after the test using `file_path.unlink()`. This ensures that tests don't leave files behind in the test directory.

* **Monkeypatching:** Using `monkeypatch` within `test_create_credentials` to mock `gs.path.secrets` correctly.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Place the provided code (`hypotez/src/goog/drive/drive.py`) and the test code in your project.
3.  Run `pytest` in your terminal from the directory containing your test file.

This revised solution is significantly better for testing the Google Drive code because it now avoids real API calls, making the tests much more reliable and faster. Remember to replace placeholder paths and credentials with your actual values if needed.  Crucially, the tests now mock the `build` function so the API isn't actually used during testing. This is critical to prevent errors and to make the tests fast.
