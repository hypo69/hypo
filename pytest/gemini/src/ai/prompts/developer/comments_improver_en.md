**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import:** The code now imports the necessary module (`comments_improver_en`).  Crucially, it assumes the file is named `comments_improver_en.py`. Change this if your file has a different name.
2. **Example Code:**  Added placeholder example code for `improve_comment`.  **Replace** this with your actual function.
3. **Fixture:** Introduced a `comments` fixture to provide a list of example comments for testing different scenarios in a single test. This significantly improves code organization.
4. **Clearer Assertions:** Instead of just `assert improved == ...`, I now use more informative assertions, checking the type (`assert isinstance(improved, str)`) and the expected output (including the exact format of the expected output), which helps debugging when tests fail.
5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases now cover:
   - Valid inputs (various types of comments)
   - Empty comments
   - Comments with only spaces
   - Invalid input (non-string)
6. **Exception Handling:** Uses `pytest.raises` to test for the `TypeError` when an invalid input is provided.  This is crucial for robust testing.
7. **Descriptive Test Names:**  Test names are now more descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
8. **Docstrings:** The code includes docstrings in the functions and fixture, which is important for clarity and maintainability.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save the example code and the test code (above) in separate files (e.g., `comments_improver_en.py` and `test_comments_improver.py`).
2.  Run pytest from your terminal: `pytest test_comments_improver.py`

Remember to replace the example `improve_comment` function with your actual code, and adjust imports if necessary. This improved test suite provides more thorough coverage and makes debugging easier. Remember to change `comments_improver_en` to the correct name of your file.
