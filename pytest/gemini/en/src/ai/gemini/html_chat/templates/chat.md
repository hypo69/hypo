**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The code now effectively mocks the jQuery AJAX calls and the DOM elements (`#chat-log`, `#user-input`). This is crucial for testing the JavaScript portion without relying on an external server.

2. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more focused on the expected behavior. For example, `test_chat_form_submission_empty_input` now verifies that the `append` method isn't called with empty data.


3. **Exception Handling (test_chat_form_submission_invalid_input):** A `pytest.raises` context manager is used to assert that the code correctly handles an invalid JSON response. This is much better than just assuming the `success` callback will always work.

4. **`monkeypatch` (test_chat_form_submission_invalid_input):** The `monkeypatch` fixture is used to directly replace the `requests.post` function with a mock function that returns an error response. This is necessary for testing situations where the server returns unexpected or error responses.

5. **More Realistic Tests:** The tests now include a mocked response to show the `success` method being called. They also check for the correct handling of cases where the AJAX response might be something other than JSON, which is a realistic scenario.

6. **No External Dependencies:** The tests do not depend on running a real server or website, making them more reliable and faster to execute.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Server-Side Tests:**  The provided code demonstrates a client-side (JavaScript) interaction.  To thoroughly test the *entire* flow, you would need tests on the server-side (Python backend) to ensure that the POST request to `/ask` is handled correctly and sends back appropriate data (JSON).

* **JSON Validation:** The tests would benefit from actually validating the JSON response. Using a library like `json.loads` would be useful, as shown in the `Invalid JSON Response` test. This prevents runtime errors if the structure of the response changes and your application is not prepared for it.


This improved solution is more robust and provides a better test coverage for the provided JavaScript code. Remember to adapt the fixture and mock function to suit your particular testing needs.


Remember to install the necessary libraries (`pytest`, `requests` if you need it).
