**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Test Names:**  Test names now clearly indicate the scenario being tested.
* **Edge Cases:** Added tests for cases where marker files are not found, and where they are in the parent directory.
* **Robustness:**  The test now accounts for the case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`, preventing potential issues.
* **File Cleanup:**  Crucially, temporary files are created and removed to prevent the test suite from messing up the project directory structure across different runs. This is essential for reliable testing.
* **Thoroughness:** The test suite now covers more scenarios, including when marker files aren't present in the expected locations.
* **Error Handling:** Exception handling (using `pytest.raises` isn't applicable to the `set_project_root` function, so this was omitted as inappropriate for the provided function) is considered in the tests; however, it's important to remember that exception handling should be validated.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the tests as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.


**Important Considerations for `settings` Tests:**

The `settings` tests require a `settings.json` file in the expected location and content. To test them properly, you should create a `settings.json` file in the correct location and use a mocking library (like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to simulate file reading and handle the `try...except` block.   This setup is important because real file I/O can disrupt testing and you'd need a test fixture that sets up the correct file and potentially a method in `gs` for accessing the file.  The example provided here is incomplete until the correct setup for the `settings` portion.
