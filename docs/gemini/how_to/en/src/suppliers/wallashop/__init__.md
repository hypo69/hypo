## Usage Guide for hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/__init__.py

This file, `hypotez/src/suppliers/wallashop/__init__.py`, serves as the initialization file for the WallaShop supplier module within the Hypotez project.  It primarily imports necessary components from other modules within the `wallashop` package.

**Key Functionality:**

* **Initialization:** The `__init__.py` file is crucial for organizing and importing other modules within the `wallashop` package.  It allows you to use the `wallashop` components within your larger project.
* **Import Statements:** The file contains a `from .graber import Graber` statement. This indicates that the `Graber` class (likely for data acquisition/processing) defined in the `graber.py` module within the `wallashop` directory is being made available for use.

**How to Use:**

1. **Import the `Graber` class:**

```python
from hypotez.src.suppliers.wallashop import Graber
```

2. **Create an instance of the `Graber` class:**

```python
graber_instance = Graber()
```

3. **Use the `Graber` methods:**

   The `Graber` class will likely have methods for specific tasks related to data extraction or processing from WallaShop.  Refer to the documentation for the `graber.py` module for details on these methods.  For example:


   ```python
   data = graber_instance.get_product_data(product_id)
   ```

   Or any other applicable method.

**Important Considerations:**

* **`MODE = 'dev'`:** This global variable likely controls the operation mode (e.g., development or production).  How this variable is used should be documented in the corresponding modules.
* **File Encodings & Execution:** The `#!` directives (`#! venv/Scripts/python.exe`, `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`) are typically used for specifying the interpreter when the script is executed directly.  Ensure your environment is correctly configured for Python 3.12 and the `venv` location is accessible.
* **Documentation:** The file's docstrings (`"""..."""`) are essential for users of the `wallashop` module. The docstrings should thoroughly explain the functionality, parameters, and return values of all exported classes and functions. Adding type hints can significantly improve code readability and maintainability.

**Example Project Structure (Illustrative):**

```
hypotez/
└── src/
    └── suppliers/
        └── wallashop/
            └── __init__.py
            └── graber.py  # Contains the Graber class
```

**Next Steps:**

To fully understand how to use the `wallashop` module, you need to examine the `graber.py` file. This file will contain the implementation of the `Graber` class and the details on its methods for accessing WallaShop data.
