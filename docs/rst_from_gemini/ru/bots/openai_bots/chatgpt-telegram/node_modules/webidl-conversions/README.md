# README for `webidl-conversions`

## Summary

This JavaScript package implements algorithms for converting JavaScript values to their corresponding WebIDL types.  This allows JavaScript code to interact with WebIDL-defined functions and properties, mirroring how WebIDL-based interfaces operate on JavaScript arguments and return values.

## Usage

```javascript
const conversions = require("webidl-conversions");

function doStuff(x, y) {
  x = conversions["boolean"](x);
  y = conversions["unsigned long"](y);
  // ... your algorithm using x and y (which are now in the correct WebIDL types)
}
```

## API Details

The package exports an object (`conversions`) where each key corresponds to a WebIDL type.  Calling a function with a JavaScript value will return the JavaScript equivalent of the WebIDL value after conversion, or throw an error if the conversion isn't possible according to the WebIDL specification.

## Implemented Types

Currently, most numeric types are supported (e.g., `boolean`, `unsigned long`, `float`, etc.).  This library is actively being developed, with support growing for more WebIDL types as needed.

## Status and Considerations

* **Numeric Types:** Primarily numeric types are covered.
* **Modifiers:**  Support for WebIDL modifiers (e.g., `[Clamp]`) is planned. This likely will involve additional parameters to the conversion functions, like `{ clamp: true }`.
* **Error Messages:**  Improved error messages, providing more context about the conversion failure, are desirable and may be added.
* **Alternatives:**  Consider using more standard JavaScript libraries or techniques for argument processing if this level of fidelity isn't strictly required.

## Background (Conceptual Explanation of WebIDL Conversions)

WebIDL defines its own type system that is distinct from JavaScript.  The process of implementing WebIDL APIs in JavaScript involves converting between these two systems.  This package handles that conversion for common WebIDL types.  The conversion involves a complex interaction between JavaScript, the WebIDL specification, and an underlying implementation (e.g., in C++ or Rust).

## Intended Use Case

This package is primarily for implementing faithful JavaScript polyfills or wrappers for web platform interfaces described in WebIDL.  It is _not_ a general-purpose argument processing library.

## Example (Illustrative)


```javascript
console.log(conversions['unsigned long'](123)); // Output: 123
console.log(conversions['unsigned long']("123")); // Output: 123
console.log(conversions['unsigned long'](true)); // Output: 1
// Conversions for other types (boolean, float, etc.) will follow the WebIDL rules.
```
```
