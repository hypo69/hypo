**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **No Actual Code to Test:** The provided code only defined classes and a constant.  No functions were present to test.  The example tests now create instances of each class to verify that they can be instantiated.

2. **Example Fixture:**  A `@pytest.fixture` called `example_prestashop_instance` is included as an example of how to use fixtures. This would be replaced with a fixture if there was a function or class needing some data to run.

3. **Clear Test Names:** The test names are now more descriptive, indicating the purpose of each test.

4. **Exception Handling (Crucial):**  The tests include `try...except` blocks. This is important because instantiating a class could potentially fail for various reasons (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect arguments).  The tests now catch and report exceptions that occur during instantiation.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The tests now create instances for every class, verifying their basic creation.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the example test code (e.g., `test_prestashop.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez` project.
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_prestashop.py`

**Next Steps (Critical if your code had functions):**

If your `hypotez` project contained any functions or methods, you need to write tests for them.  The example above is limited because there is no code for functions to test. You need to add test cases for those functions, handling various input conditions, including edge cases and exceptions. For instance, if a function took arguments, validate that valid arguments yield the expected results, invalid arguments raise exceptions as expected, and edge cases (like empty lists, None values, etc.) are handled correctly.

Remember to replace the example fixtures and tests with appropriate ones based on the functions and classes in your `hypotez` code.
