## Changes Made

*   Added a docstring to the `analyze_code` function following RST standards.
*   Added a docstring to the module describing its purpose.
*   Added error handling using `logger.error` to catch exceptions during code analysis.
*   Included input validation to ensure `code_snippet` is a string.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
*   Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads` import statement.
*   Replaced placeholders (`...`) with comments to indicate necessary but not yet implemented code.
*   Added example usage at the end with a sample Python function.
