How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block defines a function `set_project_root` to locate the root directory of a project. It initializes several project-related variables like `__root__`, `settings`, `doc_str`, and various metadata strings (e.g., `__project_name__`, `__version__`).  It also checks for a settings file (`settings.json`) and a documentation file (`README.MD`) to load and populate relevant metadata. Finally, it inserts the project root directory into the Python path if it's not already present.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, and `packaging.version` modules for system interaction, file handling, path manipulation, and version handling.

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker files as input.

3. **Find the project root:**
    - It starts from the current file's directory and iterates upwards through its parent directories.
    - It checks if any of the marker files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) exists within the current directory.
    - If a marker file is found, it sets the `__root__` variable to the directory containing it and breaks the loop.

4. **Add project root to the path:**
    - If `__root__` is not already present in `sys.path`, it's added to the front of the path.

5. **Return the root directory:**
    - The function returns the calculated root path `__root__`.

6. **Set `__root__` variable:**  The `set_project_root()` function is called to obtain the project root, and this result is assigned to the `__root__` variable.

7. **Load project settings:** It tries to load project settings from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'settings.json'`. If the file is not found or parsing fails (JSONDecodeError), it handles the error.

8. **Load documentation string:** Attempts to load the documentation string from `gs.path.root / 'src' / 'README.MD'`.  If the file is not found or parsing fails (FileNotFoundError), it handles the error.

9. **Define metadata variables:**
   - Several project metadata variables (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__coffee__`) are defined, using values from the loaded `settings` dictionary (or default values if the setting isn't found or the settings file does not exist).

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming gs.path exists (likely defined elsewhere) and marker files are in place.
    import sys
    from hypotez.src.bots.header import set_project_root

    # Example usage:
    project_root = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
    print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
    print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")
