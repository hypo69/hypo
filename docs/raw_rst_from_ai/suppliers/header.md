**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling:** The most significant improvement is the addition of error handling. The original code didn't check if a project root was found, leading to unexpected behavior if the marker files weren't present.  Now, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised if the root directory isn't found. This makes the function more robust.  The `else` block is crucial for this error handling.

* **Docstring Enhancement:** The docstring is more informative, specifying that the function raises a `FileNotFoundError`.  It also clarifies the intended behavior when no markers are found.

* **Variable Name Consistency:**  Using `root_path` instead of `__root__` is a bit more descriptive and less prone to confusion.  Using a different variable name inside the function is standard Pythonic practice.

* **Efficiency:** While the original logic was correct, the error handling and the `else` block make it a bit more efficient.  The original version did extra work on the loop when `__root__` was found (the insertion into `sys.path` would happen redundantly),  this improvement avoids that unnecessary step.

* **Readability:**  Minor improvements in variable names and structure enhance readability.

**How to Use:**

This improved function now reliably returns the root path or raises an error if it can't be found.  Importantly, the `get_project_root` function is now used to assign the root directory, not the variable `__root__` which was reassigned to the result of `get_project_root()`.

```python
# ... other imports ...

try:
    root_dir = get_project_root()
    # Now you can use root_dir to access files in the project
    print(f"Project root: {root_dir}")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This revised code addresses the potential problem of missing project root directories and provides more reliable project access. The `try...except` block is essential to prevent your program from crashing if the project root can't be found. Remember to install the `packaging` library if you haven't already: `pip install packaging`
