**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`pytest.raises` for Exception Handling:** The example now includes `pytest.raises` for checking the `ValueError` raised when `extract_domain` is called with an invalid URL.
2. **Explicit Waits:** The `driver` fixture now includes an `implicitly_wait` call to improve robustness by waiting a defined time for elements to become available. This is crucial for avoiding `NoSuchElementException`.
3. **`temp_dir` fixture:** A fixture `temp_dir` is added to create a temporary directory for test files (if needed) which will be deleted after the test.  This prevents test files from persisting, which can cause problems with other tests.
4. **Error Handling:** Test cases include appropriate checks for `success` return values and `None` (for non-existent elements).
5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The provided code now has tests for `get_url`, `extract_domain`, `find_element_by_css_selector`, and `scroll`.
6. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test names (e.g., `test_get_url_invalid`) now more clearly indicate the scenario being tested.
7. **Robustness:** Tests for the case where the element is not found.
8. **Driver Instance:** Created a `Driver` instance in the tests. This is important for mocking or stubbing in more complex scenarios.
9. **`driver` fixture:**  Avoids creating and quitting the driver in each test.  The driver is set up and torn down in the fixture. This is good practice and improves testing speed by avoiding repeated setup/teardown actions.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Install pytest and selenium:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-selenium selenium
    ```
2.  Make sure you have the correct Chrome webdriver executable in your system's PATH or the correct path to the executable passed to the `webdriver.Chrome()` function.
3. Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_webdriver.py`).
4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest test_webdriver.py
   ```


**Important Considerations:**

- **Selenium WebDriver:** Ensure you have the correct Selenium WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) installed and in your system's PATH (or provide the path to it) for the tests to run properly.
- **`driver.get_url` and Error Handling**: Consider how the `driver.get_url()` method handles errors or exceptions in the context of the overall application logic. The existing tests cover basic cases; you might need more tests if the actual handling in `driver.py` is more complex.
- **Specific Locators:** Replace `"https://www.example.com"` with real URLs and add more detailed tests using specific locators for elements on the example websites in the given project to ensure your `execute_locator`, `find_element`, `get_webelement_by_locator`, and similar methods work as expected.
- **Multiple Tests:** Add tests to validate every function in the `src.webdriver.executor.ExecuteLocator` class and its associated methods for robust test coverage.

Remember to replace `"https://www.example.com"` with actual URLs to test against real web pages.  The more realistic your test URLs, the better your tests will be. Add specific tests for the handling of exceptions and cases where the expected results differ from simple examples.
