**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `MockIopClient` and `MockIopRequest` to simulate the external API calls.  This is crucial for testability and avoids relying on external dependencies.  This is a safer approach than trying to use `unittest.mock`.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_upload_invalid_file_name` and `test_missing_file_parameter` test cases are added to demonstrate handling situations where the input is not correct. These examples use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.
* **Data Creation/Cleanup:** Added `os.remove("pom.xml")` to clean up the temporary dummy file created for testing, preventing file buildup.
* **Realistic Testing:** The `test_invalid_response_type` demonstrates how to handle different error types returned by the API.
* **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are more specific and descriptive, checking for the expected behavior and potential errors.
* **Complete Test Cases:** The tests are now more comprehensive, covering cases for valid input and potential issues.

**Before Running:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Ensure the `iop` module is available in your project. If not, you need to add it as a dependency in your `requirements.txt` and install it.
2.  **Install pytest:** If you don't have pytest installed, run `pip install pytest`.

**To Run Tests:**

Save the code as `test_upload.py` in the same directory as your `iop` module and run `pytest test_upload.py` from your terminal. This will execute the tests and report the results.


Remember to adapt these tests based on the actual API's behavior and error codes.  Adding more tests for different error scenarios (e.g., file size limits, invalid file types) would significantly enhance the test coverage.
