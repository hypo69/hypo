    print("No parent categories found for ID 11036.")

```

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The original code lacked error handling. If `c.get_parent_categories_list(11036)` returns an empty list or `None` (meaning no parent categories were found),  `print(list_parent_categories_from_prestashop)` would potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior. The added `if` statement now checks if the list is empty or `None`.  This prevents the program from crashing or printing nothing in those cases. It prints a informative message instead.

2. **Iterating and Printing:**  The code now iterates through the `list_parent_categories_from_prestashop` and prints each category individually, making the output much more useful. This is crucial if you expect multiple parent categories.  Without this iteration, you'd only see the list object itself.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `else` block provides feedback that's critical for debugging and understanding program execution.  If no categories are found for the given ID, it's important to know.

**How to use it:**

Make sure you have the `Category` class and `ide_header` module correctly defined and working.  The code now correctly handles and presents the result of the `get_parent_categories_list` function.

**Example Output (if categories are found):**

```
{'id': 1234, 'name': 'Parent Category A'}
{'id': 5678, 'name': 'Parent Category B'}
```

**Example Output (if no categories are found):**

```
No parent categories found for ID 11036.
```


This improved version is much more robust and informative, providing a better user experience and more helpful debugging information.  Remember to replace the example output with the actual output based on your data.  Also, consider handling potential `KeyError` exceptions if the dictionaries returned by `get_parent_categories_list` might be missing keys like 'id' or 'name'.  Add exception handling if you need to protect against potential problems.


```python
import pprint

# ... (previous code)

if list_parent_categories_from_prestashop:
    for category in list_parent_categories_from_prestashop:
        try:
            pprint.pprint(category)  # Use pprint for better formatting
        except KeyError as e:
            print(f"Error: Missing key '{e}' in category data.")
else:
    print("No parent categories found for ID 11036.")

# ... (rest of your code)
```

This version uses `pprint` for a more readable output of the dictionaries if there are several parent categories.  The `try-except` block now catches `KeyError` which might happen if the data structures returned by the function aren't always formatted as expected.  This will give more meaningful error messages if the dictionaries returned have unexpected keys.
