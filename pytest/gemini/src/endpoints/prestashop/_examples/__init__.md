#Important:  Always add tests that address edge cases and exception handling,
#if there are functions that require these, according to the prompt
#  - Invalid input types
#  - Empty or malformed input
#  - Unexpected conditions, like files not existing, or failing network calls.
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly state the purpose (e.g., `test_version_is_a_version_object`).
* **`pytest.raises` for Type Errors (Example):** Added a placeholder example `test_invalid_version_input` to show how to test for exceptions using `pytest.raises`.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **Docstrings:** Improved docstrings to match the requested format for better clarity.
* **`isinstance` checks:**  Added `isinstance` checks to ensure the variables are of the correct types, as specified in the prompt.
* **Handling Missing Variables:** Included a `try...except NameError` block to gracefully skip the test if the `MODE` variable is not defined. This prevents the test from failing due to missing variables.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided tests cover basic checks for the `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` variables.  Add more tests if there are other functions or classes in the module.
* **Example Fixture:**  Shows how a fixture could be used if the functions or classes in the code required additional data for testing.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the above code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_prestashop_examples.py`).
2.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_prestashop_examples.py`.

**Crucial Considerations:**

The example code provided only had very basic imports and variables. To create truly comprehensive tests, you would need to analyze the rest of the `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/_examples/__init__.py` file, determine its functions and classes, and then create specific tests for them that cover valid inputs, edge cases, and exception handling. This example provides a template and demonstrates how to write tests for different types of variables in the `__init__.py` file, but the provided code alone is insufficient for thorough testing.  You'll likely need to examine the underlying functions of the project.
