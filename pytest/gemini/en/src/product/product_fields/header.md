**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Fixtures for Dummy Data:** The `dummy_project_structure` fixture now creates a temporary directory with necessary files ('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'src/settings.json', 'src/README.MD') for testing. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoids interference with the real project structure.

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now cover more scenarios, including:
   - A case where the marker files are missing in the parent directories.
   - A case where there is an incorrect or non-existent marker file.
   - Testing `set_project_root` with a situation where `pyproject.toml` is deleted.
   - Handling cases where `settings.json` or `README.MD` doesn't exist.


3. **Exception Handling:** The tests now use `pytest.raises` (which is not used, but should be). I've replaced that with specific exception handling. 

4. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions now directly check for the expected behavior and types, making the tests more readable and easier to debug.

5. **Modular Loading Functions:** Created functions `load_settings` and `load_readme` to load settings and README content. This improves code organization and makes the test cases more focused on the individual functions' functionality.

6. **Correct `dummy_project_structure` usage:** Updated the `test_set_project_root_no_marker_files` and `test_set_project_root_incorrect_marker_file` to correctly use the returned path.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3. Run the tests from your terminal using `pytest test_header.py`.


Remember to replace `load_settings` and `load_readme` with the actual functions from your `header.py` file. Also adjust the `expected_path` in `test_set_project_root_incorrect_marker_file` to match the expected return value in your code.  This enhanced solution provides more robust and comprehensive test coverage for your code.
