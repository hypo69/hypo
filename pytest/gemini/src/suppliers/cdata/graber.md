**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** Critically important for testing classes like `Graber` that depend on external resources (like `Driver`).  The `pytest.fixture` `driver_mock` creates a mock object that simulates the `Driver` behavior.  This allows you to control the behavior of `execute_locator` in your tests without interacting with a real browser.

2. **`@patch` for Context:** The `@patch` decorator now correctly patches the `Context` class to control the `locator_for_decorator` attribute. This isolates the test from other potential interactions with the `Context` object.

3. **`assert_called_with`:** Now uses `mock_execute.assert_called_with("some_locator")` to verify that the correct locator was passed to `execute_locator`.

4. **Exception Handling Test:** Includes a test that verifies exception handling if `execute_locator` raises an exception.

5. **Dummy `some_method_that_might_use_decorator`:** A placeholder for a method that would typically use the decorator, allowing tests to be written to check the decorator's behavior in the context of a real method.  Crucially, this example now uses `asyncio.run` to handle the asynchronous method.

6. **`Driver` instantiation:** Creates a proper `Driver` object, rather than relying on `driver_mock`, in the  `test_graber_locator_decorator_set` test. This is crucial to test proper interaction with the `Driver` object.

7. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now more clearly describe the scenario being tested.

8. **Complete Test Case:** The tests are more complete by covering both the successful execution path and the exceptional path.

**How to run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_graber.py`).
3. Run `pytest test_graber.py` from your terminal in the directory containing the test file.


Remember to replace the placeholder `some_method_that_might_use_decorator` with the actual method from the `Graber` class that uses the `@close_pop_up` decorator if it exists.  You'll also need to adapt the tests to other methods within the `Graber` class if they use the decorator.  This is a significantly improved starting point for your testing suite.
