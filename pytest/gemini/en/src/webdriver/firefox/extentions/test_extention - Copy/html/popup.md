```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML.  
# Therefore, no tests can be written.


# Example of a test case if there was Python code:
# This is a placeholder and would need to be adapted to the actual Python code
# def test_some_function_with_valid_input(example_data):
#     """Tests some_function with valid input."""
#     # Assuming some_function is defined elsewhere
#     result = some_function(example_data['input'])
#     assert result == example_data['expected_output']
#
#
# def test_some_function_with_invalid_input():
#     """Tests some_function with invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input)."""
#     with pytest.raises(TypeError):  # Example exception
#         some_function('not a number')
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file `popup.html` is not Python code.  There's no Python function or class to test.  Therefore, no meaningful test cases can be created from the given input.


**How to proceed if you have Python code:**

If you have Python code that you want to test, please provide it.  I'll create test cases that cover:

* **Valid inputs:**  Testing the function with data that it expects and should handle correctly.
* **Invalid inputs:** Testing the function with data of the incorrect type, out-of-range values, or other inputs that it might not be designed to handle.
* **Edge cases:** Testing the function with input values near limits, boundary conditions, or unusual situations that could cause unexpected behavior.
* **Exception handling:** Using `pytest.raises` to ensure the function correctly handles potential exceptions (like `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.).
* **Documentation:** Tests should have docstrings to explain the purpose of each test.


**Example of how the input code would need to be modified to be testable**

```python
# Example Python code (replace with your actual code)
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle."""
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Length and width must be positive values.")
    return length * width

# Example test fixture (if needed)
@pytest.fixture
def valid_data():
    return {"length": 10, "width": 5, "expected_area": 50}

@pytest.fixture
def invalid_data():
    return {"length": -1, "width": 5, "expected_error": ValueError}
```

With this example Python function, you would see how to create proper test functions to verify the behavior with correct and incorrect inputs.  Remember to replace the example code with your actual Python code.  Provide the complete Python code for a more effective and thorough set of tests.
