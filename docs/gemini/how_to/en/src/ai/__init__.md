## Usage Guide for src/ai/__init__.py

This file, `/src/ai/__init__.py`, is the initialization module for the AI models interface.  It's designed to be used in a Python environment and provides access to different AI models.

**How to use:**

This module exports classes representing various AI models.  To use a specific model, you'll import the relevant class from within this module.

**Example Usage (using OpenAIModel):**

```python
from src.ai import OpenAIModel

# Initialize an OpenAIModel object.  This will require you to set up your OpenAI API key.
# You'll need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key.
openai_model = OpenAIModel(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Use the model to generate text (example):
try:
    response = openai_model.generate_text("Write a short poem about a cat.")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Example Usage (using GoogleGenerativeAI):**

```python
from src.ai import GoogleGenerativeAI

# Initialize a GoogleGenerativeAI object.
# Ensure the necessary credentials (e.g., service account key) are configured.
# Replace with your Google API config.
google_model = GoogleGenerativeAI()

# Generate text (example)
try:
    response = google_model.generate_text("Summarize this article...")  # Input data to summarize
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **API Keys/Credentials:** The `OpenAIModel` and `GoogleGenerativeAI` classes will likely require API keys or service account credentials.  **Do not hardcode sensitive information directly into your code.** Instead, use environment variables or configuration files to store these credentials securely.  Example: `openai_model = OpenAIModel(api_key=os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'))`

* **Error Handling:** The provided examples include `try...except` blocks to catch and handle potential errors during model interaction. Always implement robust error handling when working with external services like AI APIs.

* **Model Selection:** The `MODE` variable (`MODE = 'dev'`) likely controls which models are used in different environments (development vs. production).  Check the implementations in `.gemini.py` and `.openai.py` to see how this impacts behavior.

* **Module Structure:** The structure within the `src.ai` folder (e.g., `.gemini.py`, `.openai.py`) contains the implementations for the AI model interactions.  Refer to those files for more detailed information about specific model calls.


**Missing Information:**

The guide lacks specific details on:

* **How to install the necessary libraries.** (e.g., `openai`, `google-api-python-client` etc.)  A requirements.txt is recommended for external dependencies.
* **Detailed usage for `GoogleGenerativeAI`.** (Likely needs Google Cloud API setup).
* **Specific error handling** and potential exceptions for each function.
* **Input validation** of the parameters used in the calls (e.g., ensuring text is provided to `generate_text`).

Remember to complete these aspects for a truly comprehensive usage guide.
