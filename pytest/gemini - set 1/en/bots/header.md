**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Fixtures:** Added `example_settings_json` and `mock_settings_file` fixtures to create controlled test environments.  This isolates the `get_project_root` function from needing to interact with the actual file system for the majority of tests.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test names now clearly indicate the scenario being tested (e.g., `test_get_project_root_valid_path`).
* **Comprehensive Cases:** Added tests for various cases: valid paths, multiple marker files, no markers found, marker in parent directory, ensuring `sys.path` update.  Crucially, tests with `FileNotFoundError` and the case where `settings.json` is missing have been added.
* **`pytest.raises`:** Used `pytest.raises` to test `FileNotFoundError`.
* **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Uses `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary directories for testing, ensuring that tests do not interfere with each other or the real file system.
* **Mocking:** Uses `mock_settings_file` to create a mock `settings.json` file, allowing controlled input to the `get_project_root` function.
* **`README` Test:** Added a test for loading `README.MD` to cover that part of the code.


**How to Run Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Make sure the `hypotez` package and its sub-modules are structured appropriately.  Adjust `sys.path` if needed.
3.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This improved test suite is far more robust, covers a wider range of potential issues (including edge cases and exceptional conditions), and utilizes pytest fixtures to create a cleaner and more manageable testing framework. Remember to adapt the paths and filenames if your project structure is different. Remember to have `hypotez.src.bots.header.py` in the same directory as the test file. Remember to include `from hypotez.src.bots.header import get_project_root` in your test file.
