**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `logger`:** The solution now includes a `mocked_logger` fixture that creates a mock logger. This is crucial for testing functions that rely on external libraries or components (like logging) without needing to actually interact with them.  This isolates the login function's behavior.


2. **Type Error Handling:** The `test_login_type_error` test now correctly uses `pytest.raises` to assert that a `TypeError` is raised when an integer is passed as input, demonstrating exception handling.


3. **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are now more specific to the expected behavior.  The `test_login_valid_input` example now has an assertion to verify the return value is `True` (an essential part of testing).


4. **Edge Case Tests:** The `test_login_invalid_input` test handles the case of receiving a `None` value for the `supplier` parameter.  The `test_login_with_empty_string` test verifies the function's behavior when an empty string is used as input.


5. **Robustness:** The tests now cover more scenarios, making the test suite more comprehensive and dependable.


6. **Comments:**  Comments have been added to explain the purpose of each test.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_login.py`).
2.  Make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_login.py`

This revised solution is significantly more robust and comprehensive, better covering the functionality of the `login` function and demonstrating best practices for writing effective pytest tests.  Remember to adapt the assertions to correctly reflect the expected behavior of your `login` function for different inputs.


**Important Considerations (and Potential Further Tests):**

* **Actual Logger Verification (If Needed):** If your actual logging behavior in `login` needs to include specific messages or log levels, you should adjust the mock logger to store those messages for later verification in the test cases.
* **Error Handling:** The code does not currently handle exceptions.  You should design `login` to handle cases like the database connection errors or other problems.  Tests should cover how those are handled in the code.
* **Data Validation:**  Consider adding tests for data validation aspects of the login function (e.g., if the `supplier` string has to match a specific format or length).  These are often critical for production-quality software.
