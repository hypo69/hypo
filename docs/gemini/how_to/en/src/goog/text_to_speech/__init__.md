How to use the `goog.text_to_speech` module

This module provides a class for converting text to speech using Google's text-to-speech API.  It leverages the `pyttsx3` library for voice initialization and control, and `gtts` for the actual text-to-speech conversion.

**File:** `hypotez/src/goog/text_to_speech/__init__.py`

**Dependencies:**

*   `pyttsx3`
*   `gtts`

(Ensure these are installed: `pip install pyttsx3 gtts`)

**Class Structure:**

The core of the module is the `TTS` class.

```python
class TTS():
    """ Google text to speach """
    def __init__(self,*args,**kwards):
        tts = pyttsx3.init()
        voices = tts.getProperty('voices')
        for v in voices:
            print(v)
    ...
```

**Initialization (`__init__`)**:

*   `pyttsx3.init()`: Initializes the `pyttsx3` engine, which is responsible for voice selection and output.
*   `voices = tts.getProperty('voices')`: Retrieves a list of available voices from `pyttsx3`.
*   `for v in voices:`: Iterates through each voice and prints its details. (This part is currently only printing, but you'll need to modify it to choose a voice.)


**Missing Functionality (and How to Implement):**

The code currently only initializes and prints voice information. To use it for converting text to speech, you'll need the following additions to the `TTS` class.

*   **Text-to-speech conversion**: Add a method (`speak`, `convert`, etc.) to take the text input and translate it into audio.  This will likely involve using the `gtts` library.

```python
    def speak(self, text, voice='en'):  # Add optional voice argument
        """ Converts text to speech using Google's API. """
        try:
            tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=voice)
            # Save the audio file (customize filename/format)
            tts.save("output.mp3")  # Example: save as an MP3 file
            print("Audio saved as output.mp3")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during speech conversion: {e}")
```

*   **Voice Selection**:  Replace the placeholder with a proper voice selection mechanism.

```python
    def speak(self, text, voice='en'):  # Add optional voice argument
        # ... (other code)
        # Option to choose by name or index from the voices list
        # Example with name (if available)
        for v in voices:
            if v.name == 'en-US':
               # ... Use the selected voice
                break
```

*   **Error Handling**: Include `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during the text-to-speech process (e.g., network issues).

**Example Usage (after implementing `speak`):**

```python
tts_engine = TTS()
text_to_convert = "Hello, this is a test."
tts_engine.speak(text_to_convert)  # Convert the text to speech
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Dependencies:** Install the necessary `pyttsx3` and `gtts` libraries.
*   **Error Handling**: The current code lacks comprehensive error handling. Include error messages to help diagnose issues.
*   **Voice Options**:  Implement better voice selection. The `gtts` library likely supports more options for specifying voice and language than the example shows.


**Explanation of `MODE`:**

The `MODE = 'dev'` variable seems to indicate a development mode.  This isn't directly used in the current code, but could be a flag for future variations in behavior.
