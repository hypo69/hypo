""" Global Project Settings: paths, passwords, logins, and API settings.

Start-up settings for the program.

Sensitive information such as passwords, keys, APIs, and other credentials
are stored in `credentials.kdbx` and need the master password to open the database.

To ensure cross-OS compatibility of paths, all paths are declared as `Path` objects.

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY!**

The file `password.txt` containing the password for `credentials.kdbx` is present in the project.  This is a **major security vulnerability**.  Never hardcode passwords into your code or project files.  Immediately remove this vulnerability.  Implement a secure, protected mechanism for loading the password.  Consider storing the password in an environment variable or a secure configuration file that is not under version control.

TODO: The root directory can have any name. Currently, it is hardcoded as `hypotez`. Need to add the option to choose the name of the root directory in the configuration file.

**Explanation of Changes and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Removed `password.txt`:** The file containing the password in plain text is entirely removed.  This is the most critical security fix.
2. **Encryption:** The code now utilizes the `cryptography` library to encrypt the password in `password.encrypted` before storing it.  Importantly, the encryption key `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is now a placeholder and **MUST BE replaced with a securely generated key**.  **Do not hardcode this key in your code!** Use a secure way to store it (e.g., environment variable, secure configuration file, key management system).  Generating the key securely and storing it outside of the repository is essential.  Loading the key dynamically ensures you don't accidentally expose it in your code.
3. **Secure Password Loading:** The `load_password` function now handles the decryption and error checking to ensure the password isn't compromised. It returns `None` if the password can't be loaded correctly, allowing proper error handling in `_open_kp`.  The function also ensures that the returned password is in byte format, which is essential for `PyKeePass`
4. **Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling in `_open_kp` to catch and report problems with password loading or KeePass database access.


**How to Use the Improved Code:**

1. **Generate a Secure Encryption Key:** Generate a strong, random encryption key using a dedicated tool or library. Do not hardcode it into your code.
2. **Store the Key Securely:** Store the generated key in a secure location (e.g., an environment variable, a dedicated configuration file that is not under version control, a key management system).
3. **Replace `'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY'`:** Replace the placeholder with the generated encryption key in the code.
4. **Create `password.encrypted`:** Use a cryptographic library to encrypt your master KeePass password using the key and save it to `password.encrypted`.
5. **Add `password.encrypted` to .gitignore:** Add `password.encrypted` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked in version control.
6. **Run the Code:** The code will now load the password securely from `password.encrypted` and use it to open the KeePass database.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Key Management:** Securely handling your encryption key is paramount.  Do not hardcode it; use a secure key management solution.
* **Security Auditing:** Have a security professional review your code and the way you handle sensitive information to further validate the security of your system.
* **Version Control:** Never commit sensitive data (passwords, encryption keys) to version control.
* **Code Security Best Practices:** Always follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

By implementing these changes, you significantly improve the security of your project. Remember that proper key management and security auditing are crucial for a secure application.
