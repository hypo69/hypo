# Changes Made

*   Added imports for `logger` from `src.logger` and `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson`.
*   Removed unnecessary `sys.path` modifications.  These were likely for testing and not needed in production code.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings using reStructuredText (RST) format to the functions and added type hints.
*   Replaced the `try...except` block with a `logger.error` call for better error handling.
*   Added a `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to handle the notebook list better.
*   Modified `NOTEBOOK_FOLDER` to use a relative path.
*   Combined the notebook execution logic into a single function (`test_notebook_execution`).
*   Updated the error handling and logging mechanisms to be more robust and informative.
