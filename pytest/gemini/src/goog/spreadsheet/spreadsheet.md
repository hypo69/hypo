**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:**  Crucially, the tests now mock the `gspread` library's functions (`open_by_key`, `worksheet`, etc.) and the logger.  This is essential for isolating the `SpreadSheet` class and preventing actual interactions with Google Sheets.
* **Error Handling:** The `test_spreadsheet_init_spreadsheet_not_found` test now correctly checks for the `gspread.exceptions.SpreadsheetNotFound` exception.
* **Dummy Data:** The `test_upload_data_to_sheet_valid` test creates dummy data using pandas, and then writes it to a temporary CSV file for testing.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Assertions are now more specific (e.g., checking the `spreadsheet.spreadsheet_id` value, ensuring methods were called with the correct arguments).
* **Use of `tmpdir`:** The `tmpdir` fixture from `pytest` is used to create temporary files. This is essential for preventing side effects and ensuring test isolation.
* **`MagicMock` for Mocking:** We use `MagicMock` for mocking objects, making the tests more flexible and robust.
* **Import `SpreadSheet` Directly:** The test file now imports `SpreadSheet` from the correct module, which is a best practice.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** The provided tests cover initialization with valid/invalid spreadsheet IDs, handling missing files, and the core upload function, ensuring that your class behaves as expected in various scenarios.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest gspread google-api-python-client oauth2client pandas
    ```
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_spreadsheet.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pytest test_spreadsheet.py
    ```

Remember to replace the dummy credentials file path (`/mnt/data/google_extracted/your_data_file.csv`) in your original code with a valid path for your tests.  You'll also want to create appropriate mocks for the `_create_credentials` and `_authorize_client` methods in a more production-ready test environment.  But the examples I have given should give you a solid foundation.


This significantly improved solution addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a robust and comprehensive test suite. Remember to adapt the mocks and assertions to your exact function and class structures.
