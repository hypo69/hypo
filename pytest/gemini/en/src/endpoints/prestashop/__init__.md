def test_mode_value():

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Import Errors:** The provided code only defines imports, no function or class implementations.  The tests now check if the modules are importable. This is crucial, as errors during import prevent any further testing.
* **`MODE` Variable:**  The code defines a `MODE` variable, but its value is arbitrary. A test verifies that the value is one of a few expected options (e.g., 'dev', 'prod', 'test').  This is a simple example of testing a global variable that could be used for configuration.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  The test suite focuses on the importability of the modules, a core aspect of verifying the code's setup. It's vital to check the import success; otherwise, nothing else can run.
* **pytest Assertions:**  Using `assert` statements directly is the standard practice in `pytest` for asserting values.
* **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are self-explanatory about their purpose (e.g., `test_prestashop_module_imports`).
* **Fixture Structure (Example):** The example fixture structure demonstrates a format to set up data for testing.   If real function definitions are present, these will need to be tested with different data.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2.  Save the test code (e.g., `test_prestashop.py`) in the same directory as your `hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/__init__.py` file.
3.  Run `pytest test_prestashop.py` from your terminal.

**Important Considerations for More Comprehensive Testing:**

If the `prestashop` module contained functions or classes that accept input and produce output, the testing should include:

* **Data-Driven Tests:**  Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test with various inputs for greater coverage.
* **Valid and Invalid Input:** Tests should cover valid inputs as well as invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect data types, missing data) to ensure robustness.
* **Edge Cases:** Test boundary conditions, such as maximum or minimum values, empty lists, or special cases that might cause unexpected behavior.
* **Exception Handling:** Use `pytest.raises` to assert that the code handles expected exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).
* **Mock Dependencies:** If the `prestashop` module interacts with external APIs or databases, mock these dependencies for isolation and to test the module in isolation.


This revised response provides a practical example of unit testing for the module based on the available code.  Adding further tests for the `__init__.py` depends on the actual functions and classes that are present in the module. Remember to tailor the test suite according to the specific code you want to test.
