How to use the `hypotez/src/webdriver/bs/header.py` file

This file sets up the project environment and gathers metadata about the project.  It's crucial for initialisation in your `webdriver/bs` module.

**Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root(marker_files)`:**
   - **Purpose:** Locates the project root directory by searching upwards from the current file's location.  It looks for specific marker files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.git`) to determine the project's base directory.  Crucially, it adds the root directory to Python's `sys.path` if it's not already present. This allows Python to import modules from within the project.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     from hypotez.src.webdriver.bs.header import set_project_root
     project_root = set_project_root()
     print(f"Project root: {project_root}")
     ```
     This example will return the path to the project root.


2. **Project Metadata Retrieval:**
   - **Purpose:** Reads configuration data from `src/settings.json` and documentation from `src/README.MD` to provide project-specific metadata. This data is essential for your application.
   - **Usage:** The code loads and parses the `settings.json` file.  Importantly, it handles potential `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` for robustness.  
   - **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks ensure that if the `settings.json` or `README.MD` file is missing or corrupted, the script doesn't crash. It sets variables to default values instead.


3. **Assigning Metadata:**
   - **Purpose:** Extracts various project details (project name, version, author, copyright, documentation) from the `settings.json` file.  If the file is not found, or if a required field is missing, it uses default values.
   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     from hypotez.src.webdriver.bs.header import __project_name__, __version__
     print(f"Project name: {__project_name__}")
     print(f"Project version: {__version__}")
     ```

**Key Variables:**

- `__root__`: Path to the project's root directory (set by `set_project_root()`).
- `settings`: Dictionary containing project configuration data (loaded from `settings.json`).
- `doc_str`: String containing the project's documentation (loaded from `README.MD`).
- `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__doc__`, etc.: Variables holding the extracted project metadata.


**Before Use:**

- **`settings.json`:** Ensure that a `settings.json` file exists in the `src` directory. This file should be a valid JSON formatted file.  A suitable `settings.json` example would contain relevant project data such as the project name, author, version, etc.
- **`README.MD`:**  Ensure that a `README.MD` file exists in the `src` directory containing the project documentation.


**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** The error handling is vital to prevent your application from crashing due to missing or corrupted configuration files.
- **Modular Design:** This header file is designed to be used in other parts of the `webdriver/bs` module, providing a consistent and easily-reusable way to access project metadata.


**Example Usage in another `webdriver/bs` file:**

```python
from hypotez.src.webdriver.bs.header import __project_name__

# ... other code ...

print(f"This is a script for: {__project_name__}")
```
This demonstrates how to use the project name that was extracted from the configuration file.
