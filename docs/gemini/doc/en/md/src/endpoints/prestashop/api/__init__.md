# hypotez/src/endpoints/prestashop/api/__init__.py

## Overview

This module initializes the PrestaShop API endpoints. It sets a global variable `MODE` and imports the `PrestaShop` class from the `api` submodule.


## Global Variables

### `MODE`

**Description**: This variable defines the operating mode, currently set to 'dev'.


## Modules

### `PrestaShop`

**Description**: The `PrestaShop` class likely handles interactions with the PrestaShop API.  Details on its implementation are not included in the provided snippet.  To generate complete documentation, the content of the `api.py` file would be required.


## Usage Example

```python
# Assuming an appropriate setup for accessing the PrestaShop API
# import the needed classes and functions
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import PrestaShop

# Access the PrestaShop class, potentially performing operations
prestashop_api = PrestaShop()
# ... call methods on the PrestaShop object ...
```

**Note:**  The provided code snippet is incomplete.  To provide accurate and comprehensive documentation, the code for the `PrestaShop` class needs to be included.
