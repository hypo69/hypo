    """
    Returns an instance of the PrestaShop API.

    This function is a helper to easily get a PrestaShop API object.  It's 
    crucial for ensuring proper initialization and avoiding errors.  You should 
    use this instead of directly importing PrestaShop.

    :raises ImportError: If PrestaShop is not properly imported or configured.
    :returns: PrestaShop object
    :rtype: PrestaShop

        raise ImportError(f"Error initializing PrestaShop API: {e}")

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`get_prestashop_instance()` function:**  This is a crucial addition.  The `__init__.py` file should not be responsible for directly creating and returning objects.  Instead, it should provide a controlled way to obtain them.  This function handles potential errors during initialization.

2. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block catches any exceptions during `PrestaShop()` instantiation and raises a more informative `ImportError`. This is critical for debugging.  If `PrestaShop` relies on external resources or configurations, this allows for better error handling in the calling code.

3. **Docstrings:** The `get_prestashop_instance()` function has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, usage, potential errors, and return value.  This is crucial for users of this module.


**How to Use:**

```python
# Example usage in another module
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.api import get_prestashop_instance

try:
    ps_api = get_prestashop_instance()
    # Use the ps_api object here
    data = ps_api.get_products()  # Example method call
    print(data)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Failed to initialize PrestaShop API: {e}")
```


This improved code provides a much more robust and user-friendly way to access the PrestaShop API.  It avoids the possibility of hidden errors that are hard to track down in a larger project and allows the caller to handle potential problems gracefully. Remember to adjust the `get_products()` example to your actual API methods. Also, ensure the `PrestaShop` class has appropriate methods like `get_products` defined.  The `MODE` variable is currently unused and could be removed or used to change configurations depending on the needs.
