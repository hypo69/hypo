**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking `ResultsExtractor`:** The original code directly used `ResultsExtractor`, which would interact with the actual TinyTroupe system.  To make the tests independent, `ResultsExtractor` is now mocked. This lets us control the return value of the `extract_results_from_agent` function. This is crucial for testability, making the tests much more reliable and stable.

* **Assertions:** Replaced the `proposition_holds` function with actual assertions. Assertions now directly check for the existence of specific strings within the `results` to ensure the desired output format and content.  *Critically important:* replace `"idea 1"` with actual expectations based on the expected output of the `extract_results_from_agent` method, which is not provided and needs to be verified.

* **Edge Cases:** Added tests for scenarios where no agent is found (`test_brainstorming_scenario_no_agent`) and for invalid extraction objectives (`test_brainstorming_scenario_invalid_extraction_objective`), which both use `pytest.raises` to verify that the expected exceptions are raised.

* **Empty Results:**  Added a test (`test_brainstorming_scenario_empty_results`) to handle the case where the extraction produces no results. This is essential, as a real-world application could encounter such situations.


**Important Considerations (and Adaptations):**

1. **`proposition_holds` Replacement:**  The `proposition_holds` function from `testing_utils` is not included.  You'll need to replace the assertion logic related to the `results` variable based on the specific expected output format, if available.

2. **`focus_group_world` Fixture:** This fixture is assumed to set up the necessary TinyWorld and agents.  Ensure it's correctly defined and populates the world with the expected agents.

3. **Detailed Assertions:** The example assertion (`assert "idea 1" in results`) is a placeholder.  Replace this with specific assertions that check the structure and content of the `results` variable, given the format the `ResultsExtractor` is expected to output.  Without the actual implementation details, it's hard to say exactly how to structure this.


**To make these tests truly effective, you need to:**

- **Understand the expected output:**  What is the format of the `results` variable?  What specific strings or data should it contain?
- **Update Assertions:** Replace placeholder assertions with those based on the expected output of your system.

With these changes, the test suite will be far more robust and effective in verifying the correct functionality of the `test_brainstorming_scenario` function. Remember to adapt the tests to the actual expected behavior of your code. Remember to run `pytest` to execute these tests!
