```

**Changes and explanations:**

* **Corrected Import:**  The import `from src import gs` is now `from .. import gs`.  This uses the `..` (parent directory) syntax to correctly resolve the `gs` module from the `src` directory.
* **`__root__` -> `root_path`:**  Using `__root__` as a variable name is generally a bad idea.  It's easily confused with the built-in `__file__` or `__name__`.  Using `root_path` is clearer and more standard.

* **Explicit Path Conversion:** The `str(root_path)` conversion inside the `if` statement was added to correctly check and insert the path into `sys.path`. This is essential for correct module loading.

* **Removed Redundant `__root__ = current_path`:**  This line was unnecessary and is removed.  The `root_path` assignment happens in the loop anyway.

* **Import statements moved to after root is defined:**  This is a slight style preference; it visually separates the root finding from the module import statements that now depend on the root.

* **Import `Path` explicitly:**  Import statements of `Path` are often required.

These changes make the code more robust and readable, addressing the potential import issues that were causing problems in your original code, while maintaining correct path resolution.

**Important Considerations (Beyond Code Fix):**

* **`venv/Scripts/python.exe` shebang:** While this shebang is common on Windows, in most cases, it's better to use a more explicit `python` interpreter command rather than embedding the path in the `#!` line.  It may not be needed at all for modern virtual environments.
* **`marker_files` Flexibility:** Consider adding error handling if none of the `marker_files` are found. This will prevent unexpected behavior if the root is not located.


These changes make the code better for handling different project setups and are essential practices for writing well-structured Python code. Remember to adjust imports or `sys.path` according to your actual directory structure.
