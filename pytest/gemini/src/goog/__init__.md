# Tests for the goog module
import hypotez.src.goog


def test_mode_is_dev():
    """Checks if the MODE variable is set to 'dev'."""
    assert hypotez.src.goog.MODE == 'dev'


def test_spreadsheet_import():
    """Checks if the SpreadSheet class can be imported."""
    from hypotez.src.goog import SpreadSheet
    assert SpreadSheet  # Assert that the class exists
    


# Example of a test that would be needed if there were functions in the module
# def test_function_with_input(example_data):
#     """Tests a function with sample data"""
#     result = hypotez.src.goog.my_function(example_data)  # Replace with your function name
#     assert result == expected_output  # Replace with the expected output
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided code snippet in `goog/__init__.py` only defines a `MODE` constant and imports a `SpreadSheet` class.  It doesn't contain any functions. The provided test cases are updated to account for this by only testing the `MODE` variable and `SpreadSheet` import.

* **`test_mode_is_dev()`:** This test directly asserts that the `MODE` constant has the expected value.
* **`test_spreadsheet_import()`:** This test verifies that the `SpreadSheet` class can be imported successfully. This is crucial for ensuring the rest of your project can work with this module.

**Crucial Considerations for Missing Code:**

The original prompt requests "comprehensive test cases".  This example now *covers* the minimal amount of functionality.  Crucially missing from this example are tests for the `SpreadSheet` class itself.  To write comprehensive tests, you need the actual implementation of the `SpreadSheet` class (which is currently missing). The tests in the example require the implementation of methods in the `SpreadSheet` class like `__init__`, `load`, `save`, and any methods that perform actions, to be properly tested.


**Example of how to add tests for a `SpreadSheet` class (Illustrative):**

```python
import pytest
from hypotez.src.goog import SpreadSheet

# Example fixture (replace with actual data)
@pytest.fixture
def test_spreadsheet_data():
    return {
        "sheet_name": "test_sheet",
        "data": [
            {"col1": "val1", "col2": 123},
            {"col1": "val4", "col2": 456}
        ]
    }

def test_spreadsheet_load(test_spreadsheet_data):
    # Mocked load implementation. Replace with your actual load logic
    spreadsheet = SpreadSheet(test_spreadsheet_data['sheet_name'])
    spreadsheet.load(test_spreadsheet_data['data'])  # Example load method.
    assert spreadsheet.data == test_spreadsheet_data['data']

def test_spreadsheet_save(test_spreadsheet_data, tmp_path):  # Uses pytest fixture
  # Simulate saving to a file
    spreadsheet = SpreadSheet(test_spreadsheet_data['sheet_name'])
    spreadsheet.load(test_spreadsheet_data['data'])
    filename = tmp_path / "test_spreadsheet.csv"
    spreadsheet.save(filename)
    # assert filename.exists() # Assuming save creates a file
    # assert len(spreadsheet.data) > 0
```


**Important:**

* **Replace placeholders:** Replace `test_spreadsheet_data`, `my_function`, `expected_output` with your actual data, function names, and expected outputs.
* **Mocking:** For `test_spreadsheet_save` and other tests interacting with external resources (like files), consider mocking or using temporary files (`tmp_path` fixture from pytest) to avoid affecting the actual system.
* **Error Handling:** Implement tests to cover potential errors (e.g., invalid file paths, missing data).
* **Data Fixtures:** Create appropriate fixtures to provide test data for different scenarios.


Remember to add the `tmp_path` fixture from pytest.
