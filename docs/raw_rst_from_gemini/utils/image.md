Image Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None:
        Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> await asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> await asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> image_data = await asyncio.run(get_image_data("saved_image.png"))
    >>> image_data
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'  # Example output

**Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Error Handling (Crucial):** The most significant improvement is robust error handling.  The original code caught `Exception` but didn't differentiate between HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found) and other issues. The updated code now explicitly catches `aiohttp.ClientError` to handle potential problems during the HTTP request.  This prevents a generic error message from being logged, allowing better diagnostics.  Critically, it returns `None` in case of failure, making the function's intended use clearer.  Also, it logs `exc_info=True` for better debugging.

* **Clearer Docstrings:**  Docstrings are improved to be more complete, including possible exceptions and specific examples using `asyncio.run`.

* **asyncio.run():** Explicitly mentions `asyncio.run()` usage in the examples for better clarity, avoiding subtle errors, such as forgetting to start the event loop.

* **`file_path` consistency:**  Uses `file_path` consistently (instead of having both `file_name` and `file_path` sometimes).

* **`get_image_data` improvements:**   Returns `None` on failure to be consistent with the other functions.

* **`save_png` improvement:**  The check `if not file_path.exists()` within the `try-except` was unnecessary; the `async with` statement already handles potential issues.  The code will return `None` if there's an error saving the file, which is the proper way to convey failure to the caller.

By making these changes, the code is more reliable, easier to use, and provides better feedback in case of errors. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `aiohttp`, `aiofiles`, and `PIL`.  The `src.logger` and `src.utils.printer` imports are assumed to be defined in your project elsewhere.  If not, adjust the imports as needed.


**How to use:**

```python
import asyncio
import os

# ... (import your image utility)


async def main():
    try:
        url = "https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/example.gif"
        filename = "downloaded_image.gif"  # Or another filename
        filepath = await save_png_from_url(url, filename)
        if filepath:
            print(f"Image downloaded and saved to: {filepath}")
            image_data = await asyncio.run(get_image_data(filename))
            if image_data:
                print("Image data:", image_data[:20], "...")
            else:
                print("Failed to retrieve image data")
        else:
            print("Failed to download/save the image.")


    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        # Include proper logging, like `logger.error(...)`

    finally:
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            os.remove(filename)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


This example demonstrates error handling and shows how to call the functions. Note the `finally` block to remove the downloaded file in case of errors, improving robustness. Remember to adapt the URL and filename as needed for your use case.  Importantly, make sure to have the `src.logger` and `src.utils.printer` parts of your application defined and imported correctly.
