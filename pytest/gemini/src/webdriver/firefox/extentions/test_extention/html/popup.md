```python
import pytest

# No Python code to test in the provided HTML file.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A test file
# needs Python code to be testable.

# Example of how to test if a file exists, if that was
# the intent of the prompt.
def test_file_exists():
    """
    Checks if the specified HTML file exists.
    """
    import os
    file_path = "hypotez/src/webdriver/firefox/extentions/test_extention/html/popup.html"
    assert os.path.exists(file_path), f"File '{file_path}' does not exist."
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided HTML file (`popup.html`) contains only HTML markup and doesn't define any Python functions or classes.  Consequently, there's no Python code to test.

The example `test_file_exists` function demonstrates a suitable test if the goal is to verify that the HTML file exists as part of the project.  If there was Python code, the structure would have been different, including functions, methods, or classes to test.

**How to proceed if there is Python code:**

1. **Extract the Python Code:**  If you have a Python file (`popup.py`, for example) that interacts with or uses the HTML file, provide that code.  This would likely include functions to render the HTML, read from it, or write data to it.

2. **Identify Testable Units:**  Locate the functions, methods, and classes that are relevant to testing.

3. **Write Test Functions:**  Use the provided `pytest` test structure to write test cases:
   - Valid inputs: Test with expected data for each function/method.
   - Invalid inputs: Test with various incorrect data formats, types, or ranges.
   - Edge cases: Test boundary values or unusual conditions where the function might behave differently.
   - Exception handling: Use `pytest.raises` to verify that the code catches and handles exceptions appropriately.

Example: If you had a function to read data from the HTML, you might write tests like:

```python
import pytest
import os

def read_greeting_from_html(html_file):
    # ... (Code to read the greeting from the HTML) ...
    return greeting

def test_read_greeting_valid_input():
    """
    Test reading the greeting when the HTML is valid.
    """
    # Mock or create a valid HTML file for testing
    with open('test_popup.html', 'w') as f:
        f.write('<html><body><h1>Hello!</h1></body></html>')
    greeting = read_greeting_from_html('test_popup.html')
    assert greeting == "Hello!"
    os.remove('test_popup.html')  # Clean up

def test_read_greeting_file_not_found():
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        read_greeting_from_html('nonexistent_file.html')

# ... (Other tests for different scenarios) ...
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual Python code. Provide the relevant Python code, and I can generate a comprehensive set of `pytest` tests for it.
