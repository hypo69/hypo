**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Statements:** The code now imports the necessary classes (`Beeper`, `BeepLevel`, `silent_mode`) directly from the provided file.
2. **`set_silent_mode` Fixture:** A fixture `set_silent_mode` is created to easily enable and disable silent mode for testing.  Crucially, it uses `monkeypatch` to correctly modify the `Beeper.silent` attribute *inside the test*.  This avoids side effects between tests.
3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now accurately reflect the test scenario (e.g., `test_beep_valid_level`, `test_silent_mode_enabled`).
4. **Exception Handling:** The `test_beep_invalid_level` and `test_beep_exception_handling` test cases explicitly demonstrate how to test for exceptions raised within the `Beeper.beep` function.
5. **Using `pytest.raises`:**  `pytest.raises` is correctly used to catch and validate exceptions.
6. **Example of `BeepHandler` tests:** Added a placeholder for `BeepHandler` tests.  You will need to provide actual test cases for those methods.
7. **Missing Parts:**  Crucial parts of the `Beeper` class (e.g., `play_sound`, `play_default_sound`) are missing in the provided code.   You need stubs (or real implementations) to create complete tests for them.
8. **Assertion for Beep Function:** The `test_beep_valid_level` and other test cases were missing crucial assertions that check if the `winsound.Beep` function was called with the expected parameters.  This has been added as a placeholder -- you need to fill in the appropriate assertions based on the expected call parameters of the `winsound.Beep` method.

**How to proceed:**

- Fill in the placeholder implementations for missing methods (like `play_sound`, `play_default_sound`) and add appropriate tests to test their behaviour.
- Replace the placeholder assertions (e.g., `#Check that beep was called...`) with actual assertions (e.g., assertions for the frequency, duration, etc., passed to the `winsound.Beep` function).
-  Add tests for any other functions or methods that are part of the `hypotez/src/logger/beeper.py` file.

This improved solution provides a more robust and complete set of test cases for the `Beeper` class and covers the `silent_mode` decorator and exception handling more thoroughly. Remember to replace the placeholder assertions with the actual expected behaviour of your code.

Remember to install the `pytest` library: `pip install pytest`
