**Improved Code**



**Changes Made**

1. **Import Statements:** Corrected and reorganized import statements for better clarity and maintainability. Added `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads, j_loads_ns` to handle JSON.
2. **Module Documentation:** Added comprehensive module-level documentation in reStructuredText format (RST), describing the purpose and platform compatibility of the module. Added missing `:` for function and parameter types.
3. **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adjusted whitespace and formatting to conform to PEP 8 guidelines.
4. **Error Handling Improvement:** Removed redundant `try-except` blocks and replaced them with `logger.error`.  Import of logging is necessary for this improvement.
5. **File Header Cleanup:**  Removed the outdated shebang lines (#!) from the file header.
