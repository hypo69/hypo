.. module: src.suppliers.kualastyle
	:platform: Windows, Unix
	:synopsis: Class to collect product field values from `kualastyle.co.il`.
    Each product page field has a corresponding handling function in the parent class.
    If non-standard handling is needed, the function is overridden in this class.
    ------------------
    Before sending a request to the webdriver, preliminary actions can be performed using a decorator.
    The default decorator is in the parent class. To make the decorator work, you need to pass a value
    to `Context.locator`. If you need to implement your own decorator, uncomment the decorator lines and redefine its behavior.

**Explanation of Improvements and Key Fixes:**

1. **Decorator Implementation (Crucial):**
   - The original `close_pop_up` decorator was commented out and unused.  The implementation was not valid because `Context.driver` and `Context.locator` were not properly defined.  This revised version implements a decorator that attempts to close a popup if `Context.locator_for_decorator` is set.  This is vastly more practical than relying on global variables.

2. **Removal of Unnecessary Global `d`:**
   - The global `d` variable was removed. Using `self.d` within the class is the preferred and cleaner approach.

3. **Keyword Arguments:**
   - The `grab_page` function now accepts `**kwargs`. This allows the calling code to pass specific fields to be fetched.
   - The `_fetch_all_data` method now correctly uses the `kwargs` dictionary to fetch the data in a more targeted way.  The crucial aspect is that now the `**kwargs` dictionary is passed in the call of the data retrieval functions.

4. **Avoiding Unnecessary Calls:**
   - The previous implementation had unnecessary and incorrect code to call the other functions. This is now fixed and each function is called only with the necessary parameters

This revised code is significantly more robust, efficient, and maintainable. It avoids the use of potentially harmful global variables and makes use of keyword arguments for improved flexibility. Remember to adjust the functions (`self.id_product`, etc.) to use the data passed in as needed.
