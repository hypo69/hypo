**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `Path(__file__)`:** The original code was referencing `__file__` directly, which isn't suitable for testing. We now use `pytest.MonkeyPatch` to effectively mock the `Path(__file__)` during testing using `patch('pathlib.Path.__file__', lambda: Path(...))`.  This allows us to control the path returned by `Path(__file__)` for different test scenarios.

2. **`mock_file_system` Fixture:** A fixture `mock_file_system` is introduced to create a temporary directory and populate it with files for testing, ensuring that our test environment is clean and predictable. This is essential for isolating tests and avoiding side effects.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now include various scenarios like valid input with a single marker file, multiple marker files, cases where no marker file is found, and cases where the marker file is in a deeper directory. This provides more robust test coverage.


4. **Clearer Test Descriptions:** Test names are more descriptive, explaining the specific input and expected outcome.

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Tests are added to handle edge cases like when no marker files are found, or when a marker file is in a deeper directory, or when the starting directory doesn't have a matching file, making the tests more robust.

6. **Using `pytest.raises` (Not needed in this code):** `pytest.raises` wasn't applicable in these test cases since we're not explicitly expecting exceptions to be thrown under normal operation but only verify file existence and path determination.


This revised solution provides more complete and reliable test cases that thoroughly cover the logic of the `set_project_root` function, making it less prone to errors and improving the overall quality of the code. Remember to install the required libraries (`pytest`, `pathlib`, etc.) before running the tests.  The solution now addresses the error handling and edge cases much more efficiently.
