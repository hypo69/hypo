**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** The tests now include a crucial check for the case where the `hypotez` directory might not be found.  It avoids a `ValueError` by skipping the test.  It also checks for an empty path (or no hypotez directory).  The crucial addition is checking if the `__root__` is actually a valid path and exists using `os.path.exists()`.
2. **Clearer Assertions:** Assertions are more specific about what's being checked (e.g., if the path exists). This increases the test's ability to diagnose potential problems.
3. **Restored Working Directory:**  The `os.chdir` and `os.chdir(current_dir)` are now correctly used to restore the original working directory after testing, preventing unexpected side effects on subsequent tests.
4. **Correct Path Handling (Windows/Unix):** The code now explicitly handles both Windows and Unix-style path separators, making the tests more robust to different operating systems.
5. **sys.path restoration:** The `sys.path` is restored to its original state after the test to avoid contaminating subsequent tests.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  Save the tests in a file named `test_header.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory as `header.py`.
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This revised solution provides a more comprehensive and robust set of tests for the `header.py` code. Remember to install `pytest` if you haven't already: `pip install pytest`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **`os.getcwd()`:** Be mindful that `os.getcwd()` can return a path that might change, potentially leading to different outcomes in your tests. Consider using a more controlled path setup if possible for a more stable test suite.
* **Error handling:** Add more specific error handling and exception checks (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, etc.) to the test cases as needed.
* **Data-driven testing:** For a larger, more complex application, consider data-driven testing Startegies.
