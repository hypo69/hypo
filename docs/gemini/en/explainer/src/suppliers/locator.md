# Field Locators on the `HTML` Page

### Example Locator:

```json
  "close_banner": {
    "attribute": null, 
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//button[@id = 'closeXButton']",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": false,
    "event": "click()",
    "locator_description": "Closes the pop-up window. If it doesn’t appear, it’s not critical (`mandatory`:`false`)."
  },
  "additional_images_urls": {
    "attribute": "src",
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//ol[contains(@class, 'flex-control-thumbs')]//img",
    "if_list": "all",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": false,
    "event": null,
    "locator_description": "Retrieves a list of `URL`s for additional images."
  },
  "id_supplier": {
    "attribute": "innerText",
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//span[@class = 'ltr sku-copy']",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "mandatory": true,
    "event": null,
    "locator_description": "SKU for Morlevi."
  },
  "default_image_url": {
    "attribute": null,
    "by": "XPATH",
    "selector": "//a[@id = 'mainpic']//img",
    "if_list": "first",
    "use_mouse": false,
    "event": "screenshot()",
    "mandatory": true,
    "locator_description": "Attention! In Morlevi, the image is captured via a screenshot and returned as a PNG (`bytes`)."
  }
```

### <algorithm>

This code defines a set of locators for web elements on an HTML page.  These locators are crucial for automating interactions with the page using a WebDriver (likely Selenium). Each locator is a dictionary describing how to find and potentially interact with an element.

**Step 1: Define the Locator (dictionary)**

*   **Example:** `close_banner`, `additional_images_urls`, `id_supplier`, etc.
*   **Data Flow:**  The input is a JSON-like structure (dictionary) containing locator specifications.

**Step 2: Identify Element(s) using Locator**

*   **Data Flow:** The `selector` field dictates how to locate an element on the page.  The WebDriver uses the `by` value (e.g., XPATH) to locate the target element(s).
*   **Example:** Using "//button[@id = 'closeXButton']" to locate a button.

**Step 3: Handle List of Elements (if_list)**

*   **Data Flow:**  If the locator finds multiple elements, the `if_list` value determines which one to use:
    *   `first`: Select the first element.
    *   `all`: Select all matching elements.
    *   `last`: Select the last element.
*   **Example:** If multiple images are found, `all` extracts all, `first` extracts only the first one.

**Step 4: Execute Event (if event specified)**

*   **Data Flow:** If the `event` field is set (e.g., "click()"), the WebDriver executes the specified action (click) on the located element. The WebDriver executes `event` command on the element.
*   **Example:** `click()` on the close banner element.

**Step 5: Extract Attribute (if attribute specified)**

*   **Data Flow:**  If the `attribute` field is set (e.g., `innerText`), the WebDriver retrieves the value of that attribute from the selected element.
*   **Example:** Retrieves the `innerText` value from the element with the ID 'closeXButton'.

**Step 6: Handle Mandatory Fields**

*   **Data Flow:**  The `mandatory` field controls whether an error is raised if the element is not found (or cannot be interacted with). If mandatory is `true` and the element is not found, an error is raised.

**Dependencies:**

The diagram assumes the use of a WebDriver (likely Selenium), which is not explicitly imported but required for the functionality.  Selenium provides the methods for locating elements and interacting with the web page.


### <explanation>

**Imports:**

No explicit imports are shown in this code snippet.  The actual implementation would need to import relevant libraries (e.g., Selenium) for interacting with the web page.

**Classes:**

This code defines no classes. It presents a data structure (dictionary) to describe locators. The `ProductFields` class mentioned in the comments likely defines how these locators are used within the larger application.

**Functions:**

There are no functions defined.  The WebDriver is responsible for executing the actions dictated by the locator (e.g., click, screenshot).

**Variables:**

The variables are keys in a dictionary.  The values are strings, boolean, lists of strings, or JSON-like nested structures describing the locator. This defines the details of how to find and interact with an element on a web page.

**Potential Errors/Improvements:**

*   **Error Handling:**  While the `mandatory` key exists, the code doesn't show detailed error handling if an element can't be found. A try-except block around locating the element would improve error management and prevent unexpected crashes.
*   **Dynamic Locators:** This approach relies on static locators (like XPATH).  In complex pages, dynamic locators based on attributes not always in the same position would improve robustness.
*   **Error on `if_list`:** The code doesn't specify how to handle cases where no element matches the `selector`.  Error handling and a mechanism to manage the `if_list` parameter would be beneficial.
*   **Type Hinting:** Using type hints (e.g., `attribute: str`) would enhance code readability and allow for static analysis.

**Relationship with other parts of the project:**

The locators (this file) are expected to be used in conjunction with a component (likely in a `src.` package) that interacts with the webpage (using a WebDriver).  The locators are referenced and passed to this webpage interaction component (potentially in `ProductFields`). This suggests a design where `ProductFields` utilizes the defined locators to automate tasks on the web page.
