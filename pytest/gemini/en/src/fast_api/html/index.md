# No fixtures needed for this HTML file, as it's just static content.


def test_html_structure():
    """Checks basic HTML structure."""
    # This test is for checking the structure of the HTML file, rather than functionality.
    #  You could potentially use a tool to parse the HTML directly.
    #  For now, we'll check that certain elements are present.
    #  A more robust test would use an HTML parser library (e.g., Beautiful Soup)

    # Example check:  Verify the presence of a div with the class 'container'
    assert '<div class="container">' in open('hypotez/src/fast_api/html/index.html').read()
    assert '<form id="dataForm">' in open('hypotez/src/fast_api/html/index.html').read()
    assert '<label for="firstName">Имя:</label>' in open('hypotez/src/fast_api/html/index.html').read()
    assert '<input type="text" class="form-control" id="firstName" ' in open('hypotez/src/fast_api/html/index.html').read()

def test_javascript_form_submission():
    """Checks the javascript form submission logic."""
    # This test would ideally involve interacting with a running FastAPI server
    # to simulate the AJAX call.  Since this is an HTML file, it is not possible
    # to test this part without running the server, and verifying the response.

    # This test is place-holder. You'd need to use a tool (like `requests` or `pytest-httpbin`)
    # to interact with the server to verify that POST requests are handled appropriately.


def test_form_inputs_validation():
    """Checks if the inputs are validated correctly."""
    # This code is in the HTML, and doesn't have Python validation logic.
    # Thus, no specific test is possible.


def test_ajax_request_structure():
    """Checks structure of the AJAX request."""
    # Verify the expected structure of the AJAX request (content-type, URL, data).
    # We can't test this directly; it requires a running server.

    # This test is a placeholder.
    #  Use tools (like `requests`) to interact with the server to check
    #  the format of the POST request.

    # Example (using a placeholder, this needs server to be running):
    # import requests
    # try:
    #     response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/process_data", json={"first_name": "Test", "last_name": "User"})
    #     assert response.status_code == 200
    # except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    #     pytest.fail(f"Error making request: {e}")
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

* **Realistic Testing:** The previous tests were practically impossible to implement without a running server.  I've now added `placeholder` tests and comments indicating where real testing would be done.
* **Focus on HTML Structure (test_html_structure):**  This is crucial and checks the HTML file *itself*.
* **Javascript Logic (test_javascript_form_submission):**  This test *cannot* be fully implemented without interacting with a running server and testing AJAX calls.  It's now marked as a placeholder.
* **Input Validation (test_form_inputs_validation):** HTML forms validate on the client-side, but the Python backend is critical to verify validation from the server. This test is placeholder.
* **`pytest.raises`:**  Since there's no Python function to test, there's no need to use `pytest.raises` in these tests.

**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:**  `pip install pytest`
2.  **Save the test code:** Save the provided test code in a Python file (e.g., `test_index.py`).
3.  **Run the tests:** `pytest test_index.py`


**Critical Considerations for Actual Testing (not shown in the code):**


*   **Running a FastAPI Server:**  You need a running FastAPI server to make the `POST` request and test the JavaScript's AJAX calls and the server-side response.  Use `uvicorn main:app --reload` (or similar) to run the server during testing.
*   **Import `requests`:**   If you want to integrate more tests that verify the server response or that the AJAX call is made correctly, use the `requests` library for interactions.


Remember to replace `/process_data` with the actual endpoint you're using.  Also, add appropriate tests for the server-side code (the FastAPI app). The placeholder comments guide you toward more complete testing of the combined HTML/JavaScript/FastAPI setup.
