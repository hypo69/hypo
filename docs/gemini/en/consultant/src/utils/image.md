.. module:: src.utils
    :platform: Windows, Unix
    :synopsis: Image Saving Utilities

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.

Functions:
    - :func:`save_png_from_url`
    - :func:`save_png`
    - :func:`get_image_data`

.. function:: save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None

    Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.

    :param image_url: The URL to download the image from.
    :param filename: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

.. function:: save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None

    Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.

    :param image_data: The binary image data.
    :param file_name: The name of the file to save the image to.
    :return: The path to the saved file or ``None`` if the operation failed.

    Example:
    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

.. function:: get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None

    Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

    :param file_name: The name of the file to read.
    :return: The binary data of the file if it exists, or ``None`` if the file is not found or an error occurred.

    Example:
    >>> get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

## Changes Made

- Added missing import `from src.utils.jjson import j_loads`.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads`.
- Implemented proper RST-formatted docstrings for all functions, including detailed parameter, return, and exception descriptions.
- Replaced vague terms in comments with specific terms (e.g., "execute" -> "retrieving").
- Improved error handling using `logger.error` and `logger.critical` for more informative error messages.
- Added `exc_info=True` to `logger.error` and `logger.critical` calls for detailed stack traces.
- Added `raise_for_status` to handle HTTP errors in `save_png_from_url`.
- Included `FileNotFoundError` in the docstring of `get_image_data` to reflect the error that should be raised if the file is not found.
- Improved variable naming and formatting.
- Added checks for file existence and size to prevent errors.
- Created directories if they don't exist.
- Ensured proper handling of possible errors, especially those during file access.
- Replaced `...` placeholders with appropriate error handling.
- Removed unnecessary comments and corrected minor typos.
