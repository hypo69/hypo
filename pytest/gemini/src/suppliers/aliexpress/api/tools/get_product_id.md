**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Error Handling:**  The tests now specifically use `pytest.raises` to catch the `ProductIdNotFoundException`. This is crucial for verifying the exception handling mechanism.  It also asserts the *exact* error message, which is a better test than just asserting that an exception was raised.


2. **Comprehensive Input Types:** The tests now include more realistic input scenarios:
   - Empty string
   - `None` input (a common error)
   - Input with special characters.


3. **More Robust Test Names:** The test names are more descriptive (e.g., `test_get_product_id_invalid_input_no_match`).


4. **Fixture Removal:**  The example fixture has been removed, as it's not currently needed based on the provided code.  If `extract_prod_ids` requires a fixture, add one.


5. **Example Output Assertion:** Added an example assertion for a valid input.  Crucially, it now depends on the actual implementation of `extract_prod_ids`.  If `extract_prod_ids` returns the input string, the test is accurate. If it extracts a numerical part, the `expected_output` would change accordingly.


6. **Type checking** The test now handles `None` input by using `pytest.raises` to assert that a `TypeError` is raised.


**Crucial Next Step:**

You MUST adapt these tests to the actual behavior of the `extract_prod_ids` function.  The tests assume `extract_prod_ids` will either return the input if it finds an ID, or raise `ProductIdNotFoundException` otherwise. This needs to match the exact implementation of `extract_prod_ids`.  If you provide `extract_prod_ids`, I can make the tests even more accurate and specific.
