### **Instruction: Code and Documentation Processing**

---

#### **Main Requirements**:

1. **Documentation Format**:
   - Always use single quotes (`'`) in Python code. For example:
     ```python
     a = 'A1'
     b = ['a', 'b']
     c = {'key': 'value'}
     ```
   - Use double quotes (`"`) only for output operations:
     ```python
     print("Hello, world!")
     input("Enter your name: ")
     logger.error("Error")
     ```

2. **Preserving Comments**:
   - All existing comments after `#` should remain unchanged.
   - When modifying code, add line-by-line comments using the `#` symbol.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Use `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` from `src.utils.jjson` instead of the standard `json.load`.
   - Keep any `...` in the code unchanged as placeholders.
   - Always import `logger` from `src.logger`:
     ```python
     from src.logger import logger
     ```

4. **Structure Analysis**:
   - Check for missing imports and add them if necessary.
   - Align function names, variable names, and imports with previously processed files.

5. **Refactoring and Improvements**:
   - Add comments in **RST** format for all functions, methods, and classes.
   - Use `from src.logger.logger import logger` for error logging.
   - Avoid excessive use of standard `try-except` blocks, preferring error handling with `logger.error`.

6. **Examples of RST Documentation**:
   **Module Example**:
   ```python
   """
   Module for Programmer's Assistant
   =================================================

   This module contains the :class:`CodeAssistant` class, which is used to interact with various AI models,
   such as Google Gemini and OpenAI, for performing code processing tasks.

   Example Usage
   ----------------------
   .. code-block:: python

       assistant = CodeAssistant(role='code_checker', lang='en', model=['gemini'])
       assistant.process_files()
   """
   ```

   **Function Example**:
   ```python
   async def save_text_file(
       file_path: str | Path,
       data: str | list[str] | dict,
       mode: str = 'w'
   ) -> bool:
       """
       Asynchronously saves data to a text file.

       :param file_path: Path to the file for saving.
       :type file_path: str | Path
       :param data: Data to be written.
       :type data: str | list[str] | dict
       :param mode: File write mode ('w' for writing, 'a' for appending).
       :type mode: str, optional
       :return: True if the file was successfully saved, otherwise False.
       :rtype: bool
       :raises Exception: If an error occurs while writing to the file.

       Example:
           >>> from pathlib import Path
           >>> file_path = Path('example.txt')
           >>> data = 'Example text'
           >>> result = await save_text_file(file_path, data)
           >>> print(result)
           True
       """
       ...
   ```

7. **Final Code**:
   - The complete (original and improved) code should be presented in a single block.
   - All modified sections must be commented line-by-line.

8. **Improvement Recommendations**:
   - Follow PEP8 standards for formatting.
   - Avoid vague terms in comments, such as "get" or "do." Instead, use specific terms like "check," "send," or "execute."
