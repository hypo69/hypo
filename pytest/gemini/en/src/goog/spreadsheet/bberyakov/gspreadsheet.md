```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Mocking:** The code now uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `service_account` function. This isolates the tests from the actual Google API interaction, preventing external dependencies and making the tests more reliable.
* **Fixtures:**  Fixtures `spreadsheet_id` and `spreadsheet_title` are created to provide test data.
* **Specific Error Handling:**  The `test_get_by_id_invalid_id` test now uses `pytest.raises` to check for the expected exception. Replace `Exception` with the actual exception type if possible for more specific assertions.
* **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the specific scenario being tested.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The added tests cover initialization with ID, title,  `get_project_spreadsheets_dict`, `get_by_title` (existing/non-existing), and `get_by_id`.
* **Realistic Mock:** The tests are more realistic by using a mock `openall` method on the `gclient` object. This is crucial since `openall` is a necessary method call inside `get_by_title`.
* **External Library mocking:** The `json.loads` is correctly mocked to return a valid dictionary.


**To run these tests:**

1.  Make sure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
2.  Save the tests in a file (e.g., `test_gspreadsheet.py`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_gspreadsheet.py`


**Important Considerations:**

* **Real Google API calls:** Replace the mocks with actual calls to the Google Sheets API if you need to interact with the Google Sheets service. Use appropriate authentication mechanisms.
* **Error Handling:**  Be explicit in handling potential exceptions. The `test_get_by_id_invalid_id` now uses `pytest.raises` to verify exception handling.
* **Edge Cases:** Add more test cases to cover various edge cases and boundary conditions for each method.
* **`global_settingspread`:** Ensure that `global_settingspread.Spreadsheet` is properly mocked or stubbed within your tests.  You might need to add additional fixtures.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Thoroughly document your test functions with docstrings to explain the purpose, inputs, expected outcomes, and any special conditions.
* **Setup:** If you have complex setups, consider adding a setup fixture to manage the initial state before each test.

Remember to adapt the tests to your specific requirements and error types.  This enhanced solution is far more robust and testable than the previous versions.
