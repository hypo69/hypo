```

**Changes Made**

- Added missing `import` statements.
- Corrected `j_loads_ns` usage.
- Improved variable names and formatting.
- Added comprehensive RST documentation to all functions and methods.
- Corrected typo in log message.
- Incorporated `try...except` blocks where appropriate to handle potential errors, especially during file loading, and used `logger.critical` and `logger.error` for error logging.
- Improved `_load_settings` to handle `FileNotFoundError` and log accordingly, preventing crashes.
- Added `@property` to `current_url` to properly define it as a property (instead of just a function).
- Fixed inconsistency in docstring style.
- Added missing `return` statement in `_load_settings`
- Fixed `getattr` use, making it safer and more robust.
- Improved variable names and formatting for better readability.
