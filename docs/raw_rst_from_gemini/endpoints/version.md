**Improvements and Explanation:**

1. **Error Handling:** The crucial addition is the `try...except` block.  Now, if `settings.json` is missing or contains invalid JSON, the code gracefully handles the error and prints an informative message to the console (using `print(f"...")` for better error output).  More robust applications would log these errors to a file instead of just printing to the console.


2. **Corrected Variable Name:**  The `copyrihgnt` variable was misspelled as `copyrihgnt`.  Corrected to `copyright`.

3. **Clearer Error Message:** The error message now includes the specific exception type (`FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError`) and any associated error message, making debugging easier.

4. **Style Consistency:**  Using `__version__` instead of `__version__: str` maintains consistency.

**How to use this improved code:**

This code defines variables that can be used in your documentation, like in a `README.md` file or a Sphinx documentation generator.


**Example Usage (in a separate Python file, e.g., `main.py`):**

```python
import endpoints.version

print(endpoints.version.__project_name__)
print(endpoints.version.__version__)
print(endpoints.version.__cofee__)
```

This will print the values loaded from the `settings.json` file if it exists and is valid, or the default values if not.

This revised code provides improved error handling, which is essential for production-level applications. It also ensures that your application doesn't crash if the configuration file is missing or corrupted. Remember to put `settings.json` in the correct directory relative to `version.py` (in this case `../settings.json`). Remember to adapt the file path based on your project structure.
