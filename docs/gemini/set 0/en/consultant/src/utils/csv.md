# Changes Made

*   Added comprehensive RST-style docstrings to all functions.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns`. (Placeholder for `j_loads` / `j_loads_ns` usage, as they aren't defined.)
*   Consistently used `logger.error` for error handling instead of generic `try-except` blocks.
*   Improved variable names and comments to be more specific and clear.
*   Added `mkdir` to create parent directory if necessary, improving robustness.
*   Corrected `return None` in `read_csv_file` to handle the error case more robustly by returning an empty list.
*   Added `exc_info` parameter to error handling functions for more informative error messages.
