Image Saving Utilities.

This module provides asynchronous functions to download, save, and retrieve image data.  It uses aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests and aiofiles for asynchronous file I/O. Critically, it now validates the downloaded/saved image integrity.

Functions:
    save_png_from_url(image_url: str, filename: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Download an image from a URL and save it locally asynchronously.  Handles potential errors during download.

    save_png(image_data: bytes, file_name: str | Path) -> str | None:
        Save an image in PNG format asynchronously.  Robustly handles file creation, potential exceptions during saving, and validates the file's existence and non-empty size after writing.

    get_image_data(file_name: str | Path) -> bytes | None:
        Retrieve binary data of a file if it exists.

Examples:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png_from_url("https://example.com/image.png", "local_image.png"))
    'local_image.png'

    >>> with open("example_image.png", "rb") as f:
    ...     image_data = f.read()
    >>> asyncio.run(save_png(image_data, "saved_image.png"))
    'saved_image.png'

    >>> image_data = get_image_data("saved_image.png")
    >>> if image_data:
    ...     print(image_data[:10])  # Print the first 10 bytes
    b'\x89PNG\r\n...'

**Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Added more robust error handling for both download and save operations.  Crucially, now catches and logs exceptions during the crucial `Image.save()` call and appropriately deletes the corrupted file.  It also checks for a zero-size file after writing, preventing the saving of empty files.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved docstrings to be more informative and accurate, including examples that demonstrate the usage correctly.
* **File Validation:**  Explicitly checks if the file was actually created and if it has non-zero size after saving. This prevents silent failures and saves corrupt files.
* **PIL Verification:** Uses a `try...except` block to catch potential `PIL` errors (e.g., incorrect image format, file corruption) during image processing and handles them gracefully by removing corrupted files.
* **Removed Redundancy:** Removed redundant `pprint` calls.


This revised code is significantly more robust, reliable, and less prone to errors. It now adheres to best practices for asynchronous programming and image handling in Python. Remember to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiofiles Pillow
```
