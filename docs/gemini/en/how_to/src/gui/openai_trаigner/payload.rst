How to use the payload.py file
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python file, `payload.py`, appears to be part of a larger application, likely related to a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and OpenAI integration.  It defines a constant named `MODE` with a value of 'dev'. This constant likely controls the execution mode of the application, potentially differentiating between development and production environments. The significant lack of other functions or classes suggests this file's primary purpose is configuration or flag setting, not complex logic.  The multiple, identical docstrings (triple quotes) without content are unusual and likely placeholders that should be populated with more informative explanations.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file sets a constant variable named `MODE` to the string value 'dev'.
2. The file contains several multiline docstrings (triple quotes) that appear to be intended for documentation but currently lack content. These should be replaced with detailed descriptions for maintainability and clarity.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # No specific usage is possible given the minimal content.
    # To use this file, you would likely need to import it into another part
    # of your application, where it's used to determine the execution mode.


    # Example placeholder to show potential usage (needs context)
    import sys
    sys.path.append('path/to/your/project/hypotez/src/gui/openai_tr–∞igner')  # Adjust path
    from payload import MODE

    if MODE == 'dev':
        print("Running in development mode.")
    else:
        print("Running in production mode.")
