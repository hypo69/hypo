**vfile** is a small and browser-friendly virtual file format.  It tracks metadata about files (path, value, and importantly, messages).

## Overview

This package provides a virtual file representation, useful when working with files outside of the file system, or when handling files in a pipeline (e.g., linters, compilers).  It emphasizes messages for error and lint reporting.  `vfile` is designed to be lightweight and compatible with both Node.js and browsers.

## Key Features

* **Virtual File:** Represents files without physical presence, allowing manipulation of metadata and content in memory.
* **Message API:** Facilitates attaching lint messages and errors to specific locations within files.  This is crucial for tools that analyze code or text.
* **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies and small size, making it suitable for various projects.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Works in the browser environment with `esm.sh`.


## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install vfile
```

or, for Deno with `esm.sh`:

```typescript
import {VFile} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile@6'
```

or, for browsers (using `esm.sh`):

```html
<script type="module">
  import {VFile} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile@6?bundle'
</script>
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { VFile } from 'vfile';

const file = new VFile({
  path: 'example.txt',
  value: 'This is some text.\nWith a newline.'
});

console.log(file.path); // Output: example.txt
console.log(file.value); // Output: "This is some text.\nWith a newline."

file.message('Missing punctuation at the end of the line', {
  place: { line: 2, column: 18 },
  source: 'linter',
  ruleId: 'missing-punctuation'
});

console.log(file.messages);
```

This will output an array of messages, including the details of the error.  You can further process this message data to create reports or other outputs.


## API

The complete API is detailed in the [API documentation](https://github.com/vfile/vfile#api).


## Usage Scenarios

* **Linting:**  Identify issues in code or text files.
* **Code Formatting:** Enforce consistent formatting styles.
* **Transformations:** Modify file content or metadata during a pipeline.
* **Compilers:** Generate output files from input files.
