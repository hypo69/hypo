How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code block prepares all AliExpress campaigns. It checks for existing affiliate campaigns and creates new ones if they don't exist.  It uses functions from the `process_all_campaigns` module within the AliExpress campaign sub-module.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The code imports necessary modules, including `header` and `process_all_campaigns` from the specified locations.
2. The `process_all_campaigns` function is called. This function likely iterates through all defined campaigns, checks if an affiliate link exists for each, and creates a new one if it's missing. The `MODE` variable may be used for different execution modes, affecting the actions taken.
3. The execution completes after all campaign checks and possible creations are done. The `process_all_campaigns` function is responsible for all actions and logic within.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming necessary modules are installed and imported correctly.
    # ... (Import statements) ...

    # Example to trigger the campaign preparation
    from src.suppliers.aliexpress.campaign import prepare_all_campaigns

    prepare_all_campaigns.process_all_campaigns()
