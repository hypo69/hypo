This module provides a class for interacting with Google Drive.  It handles authentication and file uploading.

## Usage Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path('/mnt/data/google_extracted/sample_file.txt')  # Replace with your file path
folder_name = 'My Drive Folder'  # Replace with the desired folder name

google_drive_handler = GoogleDriveHandler(folder_name=folder_name)
google_drive_handler.upload_file(file_path)
```

## Module Details

### `GoogleDriveHandler` Class

This class encapsulates the Google Drive interaction logic.

-   **`__init__(self, folder_name: str)`**: Initializes the handler with the name of the target folder in Google Drive. It also loads or creates authentication credentials.

-   **`_create_credentials(self)`**:  Retrieves or creates Google Drive authentication credentials.  It uses a `token.pickle` file to store and retrieve credentials for subsequent use. If the file is present and credentials are valid, they are loaded. If not, it initiates the authentication flow, stores the credentials in the file, and then returns them.  Critically, this function now correctly uses the `creds_file` attribute.

-   **`upload_file(self, file_path: Path)`**:  This method is *not* implemented in the current code.  It should handle the actual file upload to the specified folder.

### `main` Function

This function demonstrates basic usage of the `GoogleDriveHandler` class to list files in Google Drive.


-   **`main()`**: Creates a `GoogleDriveHandler` object and retrieves credentials.  Then, it uses the Google Drive API to list files, printing the name and ID of each file found.


## Important Considerations

-   **Error Handling**: The current code lacks robust error handling.  Add `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions (e.g., authentication failures, network issues, file access errors).
-   **File Upload Implementation**: The `upload_file` method is currently empty. Implement the logic to upload the file to the specified folder in Google Drive using the `service` object returned from the `build` function.
-   **`SCOPES` Variable**: The `SCOPES` variable is not defined as a class attribute.  It should be.
-   **`creds_file` Attribute**:  The `creds_file` attribute is now correctly used and defined in the `_create_credentials` method.

-   **Security**: Storing credentials in `token.pickle` is generally not recommended in production. Consider using environment variables or a more secure storage mechanism.

-   **`gs` Module**:  The `gs` module is used; ensure it's properly defined elsewhere in the project.


```python
# Example of adding error handling to upload_file
def upload_file(self, file_path: Path):
    try:
        service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=self.creds)

        # ... (your file upload logic using service.files().create) ...
        # ... handling response
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error uploading file {file_path}: {e}")
        raise  # Or handle the exception appropriately.
```

## Missing Documentation

The code lacks comments explaining how to install the required libraries (e.g., `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`).  Add installation instructions.
