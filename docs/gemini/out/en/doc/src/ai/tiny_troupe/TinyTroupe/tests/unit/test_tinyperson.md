# test_tinyperson.py

## Overview

This module contains unit tests for the `TinyPerson` class, verifying its functionality in interacting with the environment and other agents. The tests cover various actions like listening, acting, defining values, socializing, seeing visual stimuli, thinking, internalizing goals, moving to locations, changing contexts, and saving/loading specifications.

## Functions

### `test_act`

**Description**: This function tests the `act` method of the agent. It creates two agents (`Oscar` and `Lisa`) and simulates interaction by calling `listen_and_act`. It asserts that the returned actions are valid (at least one action, at least one TALK action, and terminates with DONE).

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_listen`

**Description**: This function tests the `listen` method, ensuring that the agent correctly updates its internal messages after receiving a speech stimulus.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_define`

**Description**: This function tests the `define` method, verifying that the agent correctly updates its configuration with a new value and modifies its prompt to include the new value.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_define_several`

**Description**: This function tests the `define_several` method. It defines multiple values to a group within the agent's configuration.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_socialize`

**Description**: This function tests socializing with another agent. It creates two agents, establishes a relationship, simulates interaction, and asserts that the actions are valid (at least one action, at least one TALK action, and includes a reference to the other agent).

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_see`

**Description**: This function tests the `see` method for processing visual stimuli. It simulates visual input and asserts that the agent responds with a THINK action containing the visual description.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_think`

**Description**: This function tests the `think` method, simulating internal thought processes and asserting the agent responds with a TALK action containing the thought content.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_internalize_goal`

**Description**: This function tests the `internalize_goal` method, simulating the agent adopting a goal and asserting it leads to a SEARCH action.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_move_to`

**Description**: This function tests the `move_to` method, ensuring the agent updates its current location and context appropriately.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_change_context`

**Description**: This function tests the `change_context` method to verify updating of current context.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)


### `test_save_spec`

**Description**: This function tests the `save_spec` method for saving agent specifications. It saves to a file, verifies file existence, loads the saved spec, and confirms that the loaded agent's configuration (excluding name) matches the original agent.

**Parameters**:
- `setup` (object): Setup function to properly set up test environment. (This is a placeholder, as the exact setup behavior isn't defined here)
