**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **Import `pytest`:** The code now correctly imports the `pytest` library.

2. **Fixture for Data:** A `@pytest.fixture` called `example_data` is defined to provide test data. This is crucial for isolating tests and avoiding accidental modification of global state.

3. **Specific Test Cases for Graber:**  Example tests for `Graber.__init__` are included.  Crucially, these tests now cover *valid input*, *empty data*, and *invalid data type* (using `pytest.raises` which is critical for exception handling).

4. **Clear Test Names:** Test function names are descriptive (e.g., `test_graber_init_valid`, `test_graber_init_empty_data`).

5. **Plausible Assertions:** Example assertions use `assert graber.data == example_data`. This assumes that `Graber` stores its data in an attribute called `data`. You will need to modify these assertions based on the `Graber` class's implementation.

6. **Missing Parts:**  **Crucially**, the provided code only had a `Graber` class *definition*. You *must* write example tests for any methods that `Graber` has. The example tests are *placeholder* (i.e., they show what you need to do, but the example test uses dummy names for `process_data` and inputs and outputs).  You need to actually adapt this to the correct methods, parameters, and expected outcomes of your `Graber` class.

7. **Testing `MODE`:** A test function (`test_mode_value`) checks that the `MODE` variable has the expected value, as requested.

8. **Comments and Documentation:**  The tests now include comments explaining the logic and purpose of each test case. This is essential for maintainability.

**How to Adapt:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** Change the placeholder comments in the example tests to the actual method names, parameter names, and expected results for your `Graber` class.
* **Add More Tests:** Add more test cases for different scenarios, including edge cases (e.g., large inputs, empty inputs, unexpected types) and boundary conditions.  If `Graber` has other methods, write test cases for those as well.
* **Use `mocker` (Optional):** For tests that involve external modules, consider using `pytest.mocker` to patch those modules or simulate their behavior. This is very important for testing dependencies.

**Before running:**

1. **Ensure the code for `hypotez/src/suppliers/hb/__init__.py` is properly formatted and correct.** The tests are only helpful if the actual code is correct.

2. **Save the tests** in a file named something like `test_hb.py` (or similar).

3. **Run `pytest` from your terminal** in the directory containing the test file (`test_hb.py`) and the `hypotez` directory.  This assumes you have pytest installed.


This revised response provides a much more complete and helpful example for testing a Python class like `Graber`. Remember to adapt the tests to the specific methods and attributes of your code. Remember to adapt this structure to the specific methods and attributes of your Graber class.
