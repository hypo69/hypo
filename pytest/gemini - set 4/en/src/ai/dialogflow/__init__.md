**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided code `hypotez/src/ai/dialogflow/__init__.py` is empty except for docstrings and comments.  It doesn't define any functions or classes that can be tested.  Therefore, no test cases can be written based on this.

To generate meaningful test cases, you need to provide the actual Python code (functions, methods, classes) that you want to test.  This empty code snippet doesn't allow for any testable logic.

**How to proceed with testing:**

1. **Provide the actual Python code:**  Copy and paste the relevant functions, methods, and classes into the `input_code` field.
2. **Identify test cases:** Determine what inputs the functions accept, what outputs they should produce for various inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases), and what exceptions they might raise.
3. **Design tests:**  Based on the identified cases, craft `pytest` test functions.
4. **Use `pytest` features:**  Leverage `pytest.raises` for checking exceptions, fixtures for providing data, and assertions (`assert`) for verifying expected outputs.

This example provides a template for the basic structure of test functions and an example of a fixture if needed.  Crucially, the example assumes that your actual code defines a function called `my_function` to test, which is a placeholder. Provide the code you want to test to generate the actual tests.
