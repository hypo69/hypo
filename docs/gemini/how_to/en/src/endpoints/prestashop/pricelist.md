**Explanation of Improvements and Key Concepts:**

* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints (e.g., `product_ids: list`, `new_price: float`) for better code clarity and maintainability.  Crucially, I've changed `products` to `product_ids` to reflect that this should be a list of *identifiers* rather than product objects.
* **Error Handling:**  Added `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during API calls (e.g., network issues, invalid data).  This is crucial.  Includes specific error handling for the `api_credentials`. It also returns an empty dictionary in cases where product IDs are not found.
* **Clearer API Call Simulation:** The `request_prices` method now more accurately simulates an API call. It now sends a list of product IDs to the API for price retrieval. It also has a check for whether a response was actually received.  Error handling is included.
* **`_make_api_call` placeholder:** Added a placeholder method to indicate where the actual API interaction should occur.  This is vital to decouple the code from an *actual* API call from this example.
* **Parameter Validation:** Validates `api_credentials` to ensure it's a dictionary and that necessary keys (`api_domain`, `api_key`) exist. Also validates `product_ids` to enforce a list.
* **Explicit Return Types:** The functions now clearly define what they are supposed to return.
* **Use of `float`:** Ensures prices are stored as floats to handle decimal values correctly.


**How to Use:**

```python
from hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop.pricelist import PriceListRequester

# Replace with your actual credentials
credentials = {
    'api_domain': 'your-api-domain',
    'api_key': 'your-api-key'
}

requester = PriceListRequester(credentials)

product_ids = ["123", "456", "789"] # Replace with actual product IDs
prices = requester.request_prices(product_ids)

if prices:
    for product_id, price in prices.items():
        print(f"Product {product_id}: ${price}")

try:
  success = requester.modify_product_price("123", 15.99)  # Replace with valid product ID
  if success:
    print("Product price updated successfully.")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error updating price: {e}")

```


Remember to replace placeholders like `your-api-domain` and `your-api-key` with your actual API credentials. Also, you'll need to implement the `_make_api_call` method to actually interact with the PrestaShop API using appropriate libraries.
