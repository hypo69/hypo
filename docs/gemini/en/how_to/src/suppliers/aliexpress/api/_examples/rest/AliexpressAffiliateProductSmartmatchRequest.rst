How to use the AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest class
=================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines a class `AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest` that interacts with the AliExpress affiliate API for retrieving product information using smart matching.  It's a subclass of the `RestApi` class, indicating it's a REST API client. The class initializes various parameters to be sent in the API request, including app information, country, device details, keywords, pagination, product IDs, site, currency, language, tracking information, and user details.  Crucially, it defines the API endpoint name ('aliexpress.affiliate.product.smartmatch').

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Initialization:** The class constructor (`__init__`) takes the API domain and port as arguments. It initializes various attributes (e.g., `app`, `keywords`, `page_no`) to `None`.  These attributes will be populated by the user before calling the API.

2. **Setting parameters:**  The user sets the relevant parameters for the API call by assigning values to the attributes of the object.  For example, `self.keywords = "product keyword"`. This step is critical:  the API request will be built based on the values you specify.


3. **API name retrieval:**  The `getapiname` method returns the name of the API endpoint ('aliexpress.affiliate.product.smartmatch'). This name is used to identify the specific API call when making the request.

4. **(Implicit) API call:** The class itself doesn't contain the actual API call.  This class is a request object and is intended to be used to construct and send the API call. The actual API call, including sending the request, handling responses, and parsing data, is expected to occur in another part of the application. For example, other Python code might instantiate this object, populate the parameters, and then call an associated function in `RestApi` for sending requests.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from hypotez.src.suppliers.aliexpress.api._examples.rest.AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest import AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest

    # Create an instance of the request object.
    request_obj = AliexpressAffiliateProductSmartmatchRequest()

    # Set the parameters.  Crucially, you need to provide values for the API request.
    request_obj.keywords = "running shoes"
    request_obj.page_no = 1
    request_obj.target_language = "en"

    # Now you would typically use the RestApi class's method (likely 'execute') to send the request and process the response.
    #  This example is illustrative, a full implementation would need additional code.
    #  Example (hypothetical):
    # try:
    #     response = request_obj.execute()  # Replace with the appropriate RestApi method
    #     # Process the response...
    #     data = response.get_data()  # Extract the data from the response
    #     print(data)
    # except Exception as e:
    #     print(f"Error: {e}")
