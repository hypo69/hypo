**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **`requests` Error Handling:** The `speech_recognizer` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch potential `requests.exceptions.RequestException` during the audio download.  This is crucial for robustness; a simple `requests.get` without error handling could crash the program if the URL is invalid or the server is down. It also returns a meaningful error message.  Crucially, it uses `response.raise_for_status()` to check for bad HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found).
* **Efficient Download:** The code now uses `response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192)` to download the audio in chunks, which is significantly more efficient for large files compared to downloading the entire file into memory at once. This prevents memory issues.
* **Clearer Error Handling:** The `text2speech` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch and log any errors that might occur during the conversion process. This helps with debugging and provides more informative error messages to the caller.
* **Docstring Enhancements:** Added `Raises` sections to the docstrings to clearly document potential exceptions that functions might throw. This is extremely helpful for the function user.  Improved the example usage in docstrings.

These changes make the code more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.  Always include proper error handling in production code. Remember to install the required libraries if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install requests pydub speechrecognition gtts
```
