**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking `gs.path.google_drive`:** The original code used a global variable `gs.path.google_drive` that likely interacts with Google Drive.  This is crucial for testing, because interacting with external resources like Google Drive is outside the scope of unit testing and introduces flakiness.  The `mock_google_drive_path` fixture provides a temporary directory that acts as a stand-in for the Google Drive path, making the tests independent of external systems.

2. **Mocking `get_directory_names`:** The `get_directory_names` function was crucial to mock for the purposes of testing.  The tests now assert that the code correctly gets the list of directory names.  It should check that the directory actually exists and if it is empty.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_get_directory_names_non_existent_directory` test now correctly checks for the `FileNotFoundError` exception that should be raised when the directory is not found.


4. **Clearer Test Names:**  The test names are more descriptive.

5. **Fixture for Temporary Directory:**  A `mock_google_drive_path` fixture is introduced to create a temporary directory to avoid interfering with any existing files.

6. **Missing `Path` Import:** The necessary `Path` import from `pathlib` is included, making the code robust.

**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Replace placeholders:** Replace `"hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/prepare_campaigns"` with the actual path to your `prepare_campaigns` module.

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest your_test_file.py
   ```
   (Replace `your_test_file.py` with the name of your test file.)

**Crucial Considerations (not implemented above):**

* **`process_*` function content:**  The tests currently only verify *calls* to these functions.  You need tests that verify what the functions *do* (e.g., create files/directories, make API calls etc.).  Mocking and patching is essential to test these actions without external side effects.
* **External Dependencies:** If the functions rely on external APIs or services (like Google Drive), you should mock those out using `unittest.mock`.  The example above shows how to mock `Path`.  You would need to mock the API interactions for real testing. 


Remember to adapt the tests to the actual implementation of the code and the operations it performs.  This revised approach addresses the fundamental flaw of testing against a file system, which makes the tests unreliable and not maintainable.
