**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **No Code to Test:**  The provided input code is just Markdown documentation.  There's no Python code to test!  The placeholder tests now reflect this.

2. **File Existence Tests:** The tests now focus on validating that the *files* exist, which is the only action that can be tested given the input.


3. **File Content Tests (Non-Empty):**  Crucially, tests check if the files are *not empty* (after stripping whitespace).  This ensures the files contain some information, crucial for their intended purpose.

4. **Error Handling and Skipping:**  The tests now use `pytest.skip` if the file doesn't exist. This is essential for robustness.  It avoids errors and keeps tests focused on the existence check for that specific file.

5. **Clearer Comments:** The comments now clearly explain the purpose of each test and the assumptions being made.

6. **Correct `pytest` Structure:** The code is structured as a proper `pytest` test file, complete with docstrings for clarity.

**Before Running:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  Change the placeholder file paths (`'hypotez/src/endpoints/kazarinov/instructions/system_instruction_mexiron.md'`, etc.) with the actual file paths if you know them.


**How to Run:**

1.  Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `test_instructions.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_instructions.py` from your terminal in the same directory.

This revised response provides a functional example of `pytest` tests specifically addressing the inputted information, focusing on the *existence* and *content* of the markdown files, rather than attempting to test non-existent Python code. Remember to adapt the file paths as needed. Remember that if you had Python code to test, the testing methodology would be fundamentally different.
