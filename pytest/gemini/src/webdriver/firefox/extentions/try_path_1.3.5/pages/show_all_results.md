# Note:  To make these tests more robust, you need to mock or stub
# the parts of the JavaScript code that interact with the DOM.
# Using js2py in this context limits what you can verify because 
# it's not directly interacting with a browser environment.
# Ideally, you would have the code run in a real browser or a suitable JavaScript testing environment,
# which would let you interact with the DOM.
```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements:**

1. **js2py Integration:**  The provided JavaScript code is now executed using `js2py`. This is crucial because you can't directly interact with the browser's DOM from a Python test.  This enables you to call `showAllResults` with test data.

2. **Placeholder Assertions:**  The example tests include placeholder assertions (`assert ...`). You *must* replace these with assertions that verify the *actual* behavior of the JavaScript code in the `showAllResults` function.  This is difficult without using mocking or browser-based JavaScript testing framework.

3. **Error Handling:** The `test_show_all_results_invalid_results` test demonstrates how to check for exception handling by using `pytest.raises`.

4. **Data Handling:**  The `test_show_all_results_valid_input` test demonstrates the setup for valid input test cases. You need more specific assertions (`assert js_env.document.getElementById("message").textContent == "test message"`) that check the correct update of elements in the HTML.

5. **Complete Test Coverage:** The existing tests are just starting points.  You need to add tests for more scenarios (e.g., testing the `makeInfoText` and `makeTextDownloadUrl` functions, edge cases, invalid input types, handling of potential errors during DOM interactions).

**How to actually run these tests (and crucially, how to get assertions to work):**

* **Use a real browser environment or testing framework for JavaScript:**  Directly using `js2py` for testing the DOM manipulation parts of JavaScript will make the assertions difficult to write. Use a testing environment like Selenium (with Python bindings) and run the JavaScript code in a headless browser. Selenium allows interacting with the DOM and performing assertions.
* **Mocking or Stubbing DOM Interactions:**  You might need to mock or stub the parts of the JavaScript code that interact with the DOM. This way you can isolate the parts you want to test.



**Important:** The current tests are not fully functional. The most important thing is how you run these tests and how you can make assertions within those tests. You need to have the JavaScript code run in a context where you can interact with the DOM to check the behavior of `showAllResults`.  Without a browser or a proper testing environment, this approach using `js2py` will have severe limitations on test coverage and effectiveness.
