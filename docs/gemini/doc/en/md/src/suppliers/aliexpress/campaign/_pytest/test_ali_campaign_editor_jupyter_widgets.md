# Module: hypotez/src/suppliers/aliexpress/campaign/_pytest/test_ali_campaign_editor_jupyter_widgets.py

## Overview

This module contains pytest tests for functions related to file operations, specifically focusing on the `src.utils.file.file` module.  It utilizes `unittest.mock` for patching file operations and asserts the correct functionality of these file handling methods.

## File Handling Functions

### `test_save_text_file`

**Description**: This function tests the `save_text_file` function, verifying that a file is created and the provided text is written to it. It uses mocking to simulate file operations.

**Parameters**:

- `mock_logger` (MagicMock): A mocked logger instance.
- `mock_mkdir` (MagicMock): A mocked `Path.mkdir` instance.
- `mock_file_open` (MagicMock): A mocked `Path.open` instance.

**Example Usage**:

```python
test_save_text_file()
```

**Assertions**:

- Verifies that `mock_file_open` is called with the correct parameters ("w" mode, UTF-8 encoding).
- Checks that the `write` method of the opened file is called once with the expected text.
- Confirms that `mock_mkdir` is called once (potentially handling a missing directory).


### `test_read_text_file`

**Description**: This function tests the `read_text_file` function, ensuring that the correct text is read from a file.  This test utilizes file mocking to verify expected behavior.

**Parameters**:

- `mock_file_open` (MagicMock): A mocked `Path.open` instance pre-populated with test data.

**Example Usage**:

```python
test_read_text_file()
```

**Returns**:

- Returns the content of the file (a string).

**Assertions**:

- Asserts that the returned content from `read_text_file` matches the expected data.
- Checks if `mock_file_open` is called with the correct parameters ("r" mode, UTF-8 encoding).

### `test_get_filenames`

**Description**: This function tests the `get_filenames` function, ensuring it correctly gathers filenames from a given directory.

**Example Usage**:

```python
filenames = test_get_filenames()
print(filenames)  # Output: ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
```

**Returns**:

- A list of filenames as strings.

**Assertions**:

- Checks that `get_filenames` returns a list containing the expected filenames.  Mocks `Path.iterdir` to provide test data.


### `test_get_directory_names`

**Description**: This function tests the `get_directory_names` function, ensuring it correctly gathers directory names from a given path.

**Example Usage**:

```python
directories = test_get_directory_names()
print(directories) # Output: ['dir1', 'dir2']
```

**Returns**:

- A list of directory names as strings.

**Assertions**:

- Verifies the returned list of directory names against the expected values. Uses mocking on `Path.iterdir` to provide test data.
