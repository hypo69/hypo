How to use the login functions
========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python code defines functions for logging in to the Kualastyle supplier.  It includes a `login` function that calls `close_pop_up` and a `close_pop_up` function for handling potential pop-up windows during the login process.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The code imports the `logger` module from the `src` package. This is likely used for logging errors or informational messages during the login process.

2. **Define the `login` function:** This function takes a `Supplier` object (`s`) as input, likely containing information about the supplier and its associated browser.

3. **Call `close_pop_up`:** Inside the `login` function, it calls the `close_pop_up` function, passing the `Supplier` object.

4. **Return `True`:** The `login` function returns `True`, indicating a successful login attempt.

5. **Define the `close_pop_up` function:** This function also takes a `Supplier` object as input.

6. **Retrieve driver and locator:** It retrieves the browser driver (`_d`) and the locator dictionary (`_l`) from the `Supplier` object. The locator is crucial for locating and interacting with the pop-up window.

7. **Navigate to the Kualastyle website:** It navigates the browser to the Kualastyle website ('https://www.kualastyle.com').

8. **Set window focus:** It sets the focus to the current browser window to ensure actions are performed on the intended window.

9. **Wait for elements:** It waits for 5 seconds to allow the webpage to fully load and elements to be accessible.

10. **Execute locator (try-except block):** It tries to execute the locator (`_l`) to find and close the pop-up window.  A `try-except` block handles potential errors during this process, logging a warning message to the console if closing fails.

11. **Handle exceptions:**  The `except Exception as e` block catches any errors that occur during the execution of the locator and logs a warning message, indicating failure to close the pop-up.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from src.suppliers.kualastyle.login import login
    from my_supplier_class import Supplier  # Replace with your Supplier class

    # Example Supplier object (replace with your actual object)
    supplier_instance = Supplier(...)
    
    # Attempt the login
    success = login(supplier_instance)

    if success:
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Login failed.")
