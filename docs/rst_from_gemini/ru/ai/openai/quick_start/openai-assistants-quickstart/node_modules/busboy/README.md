# busboy - Node.js module for parsing incoming HTML form data

This module provides a robust and efficient way to parse incoming HTML form data, particularly for multipart/form-data requests.  It's well-suited for handling file uploads and other form inputs.

## Installation

```bash
npm install busboy
```

## Usage

The core of using `busboy` involves creating a server, listening for incoming POST requests, and instantiating a `busboy` parser on the request stream.  Here are two examples demonstrating different approaches:

### Example 1:  Handling Files and Fields

This example demonstrates how to handle both file uploads and simple form fields:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const busboy = require('busboy');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const bb = busboy({ headers: req.headers });

    bb.on('file', (name, file, info) => {
      // Extract filename, encoding, and mime type
      const { filename, encoding, mimeType } = info;
      console.log(`File [${name}]: filename: ${filename}, encoding: ${encoding}, mimeType: ${mimeType}`);

      // Important: Handle file data
      file.on('data', (data) => {
        console.log(`File [${name}] received chunk: ${data.length} bytes`);
        // Process the chunk of data (e.g., write to disk)
      }).on('end', () => {
        console.log(`File [${name}] completed`);
        // Indicate successful processing
      }).on('error', (err) => {
        console.error(`Error processing file ${name}:`, err);
      });

    });
    
    bb.on('field', (name, val, info) => {
      console.log(`Field [${name}]: value: ${val}`);
    });

    bb.on('close', () => {
      console.log('Finished parsing form.');
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end('Form data parsed successfully.');
    });

    req.pipe(bb);
  } else {
      res.writeHead(405);
      res.end();
  }
}).listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('Listening for requests on port 8000');
});
```

This example will output details of the received file (name, filename, encoding, mime type) and each form field value to the console.  **Crucially**, it handles the data stream properly, which is essential for file uploads.

### Example 2: Saving Files to Disk

This example shows how to save uploaded files to the disk:

```javascript
// ... (imports as in the original example)

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const bb = busboy({ headers: req.headers });
    const uploadDirectory = './uploads'; // Define your upload directory

    bb.on('file', (fieldname, file, info) => {
      const { filename } = info;

      const filePath = path.join(uploadDirectory, filename);
      const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(filePath);

      file.pipe(writeStream);
      writeStream.on('finish', () => {
        console.log(`File ${filename} saved to ${filePath}`);
      });
      writeStream.on('error', (err) => {
        console.error(`Error saving file ${filename}:`, err);
      });

    });

    // ... (rest of the code as in Example 1, including close event and response)

  }
}).listen(8000, () => { /* ... */ });
```

Remember to handle errors appropriately (e.g., file write errors).  The path to the upload directory should be adjusted to your needs.


## API Reference

Consult the official [busboy documentation](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy) for comprehensive details on the `busboy` API and its various options.


## Key Considerations


* **Error Handling:** Always include error handling (e.g., `try...catch` blocks) for file operations.
* **File Handling:**  Consume the file stream in a `'file'` event handler, piping it to a `fs.createWriteStream` or another appropriate destination.  Failure to do so will result in incomplete file processing or potential memory issues.
* **Security:** Sanitize and validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.  Do not blindly trust filenames.  Use a secure method to name and store uploaded files.
* **Limits:** Use the `limits` configuration options to control the amount of data processed to avoid overloading the server.
