```python
import pytest
from packaging.version import Version
from hypotez.src.category._examples import __version__, __doc__, __details__

# Tests for __version__
def test_version_type():
    """Checks if __version__ is a Version object."""
    assert isinstance(__version__, Version)

def test_version_string():
    """Checks if __version__ is a string representation of a version."""
    assert isinstance(str(__version__), str)

# Tests for __doc__
def test_docstring_type():
    """Checks if __doc__ is a string."""
    assert isinstance(__doc__, str)

def test_docstring_not_empty():
    """Checks if __doc__ is not empty."""
    assert __doc__

# Tests for __details__
def test_details_type():
    """Checks if __details__ is a string."""
    assert isinstance(__details__, str)

def test_details_not_empty():
    """Checks if __details__ is not empty."""
    assert __details__
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

The provided Python code (`hypotez/src/category/_examples/__init__.py`) imports `packaging.version` and defines `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__`.  The tests above directly address these variables, checking their types and ensuring they are not empty strings.  Importantly, the tests are now focused and accurate regarding the expected behavior of the module elements.

* **Specific Test Cases:** The tests now cover `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` individually.
* **Type Validation:**  Crucially, the tests use `isinstance` to validate the expected types for each variable (`Version` for `__version__`, `str` for `__doc__` and `__details__`). This is more robust than just checking if they are strings or not.
* **Edge Cases (or Lack Thereof):** The original code snippet lacked clear conditions or potential problematic data for the variables.  Since the current code is a simple import and attribute check, the tests focus on ensuring the basic expected functionality works (i.e., `__version__` returns a version object, etc.).
* **Readability and Clarity:**  The test function names are now more descriptive, which improves understanding.  Each test function has a docstring that concisely describes the functionality being tested.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_examples.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed: `pip install pytest`
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_examples.py`

This improved set of tests will verify that the relevant parts of the example module work as expected. If you have more functions, classes, or complex logic within your `hypotez/src/category/_examples/__init__.py` file, you should add tests to cover those as well, using the principles of testing valid/invalid input, edge cases, and error handling. Remember to adapt the test functions to the specific functionality being implemented. Remember to use `pytest.raises` for exception testing.
