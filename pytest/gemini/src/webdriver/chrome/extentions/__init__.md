# These examples are based on the provided code snippet. If the actual functions have more complex logic,
#  add more relevant test cases that cover all possible scenarios.
#  For example, if there were functions that take arguments or modify variables, you would write test cases for different values of those inputs
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Import Correctly:** The code now imports `__version__`, `__doc__`, and `__details__` from the correct module.  This is crucial for the tests to work.

2. **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive and indicate the purpose of each test.

3. **`pytest.raises` (Example):**  An example of using `pytest.raises` to check for a `ValueError` if `__version__` isn't a valid version string is included.  **Important:**  This example is a placeholder; you should add `pytest.raises` calls if there are functions that might raise exceptions.

4. **Version Handling:** The `test_version_is_a_version_object` and `test_version_string_format` tests are crucial for ensuring the version string is properly validated.

5. **Comprehensive Testing (Placeholder):**  The provided code example doesn't have any function calls; thus, there are no meaningful tests beyond basic validation.


**How to Run the Tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a `.py` file (e.g., `test_extentions.py`).
2.  Ensure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
3.  Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_extentions.py`


**Important Considerations:**


* **Missing Code:** The provided code snippet is extremely minimal.  If the actual module had functions with arguments, loops, conditional statements, etc., you'd need to write tests that verify the correct behavior for various scenarios.
* **Specific Scenarios:** Identify functions and methods within the module and create test cases to cover the different situations (e.g., normal inputs, edge cases, error handling).
* **Edge Cases:**  Think about boundary conditions (minimum/maximum values, empty inputs, etc.) for inputs to functions and methods.
* **Example Error Handling:** A test case has been added to show how to test for exceptions if a function's inputs are wrong. You should adapt this example to the functions you are testing.


Remember to adapt these tests to the actual logic and functionality of your module. The provided example covers the basics for testing constants but is far from exhaustive. Provide the full module content for more targeted and comprehensive test coverage.
