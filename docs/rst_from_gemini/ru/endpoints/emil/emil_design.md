**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try...except` blocks to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` when reading files and `Exception` during AI model interaction, Facebook posting, and Prestashop upload. This prevents the entire script from crashing if there's an issue with a single file or step.  Crucially, it logs the errors to aid debugging.
* **JSON Handling:** `json.loads` is used correctly to convert the JSON response from OpenAI to a `SimpleNamespace` object.  I've changed the way you dump the data to `images_descriptions_he.json` to be more robust and use correct JSON structures.
* **Robust File Handling:** The `try-except` block now makes sure that attempting to read the files is safe, preventing errors.
* **Corrected URL:**  The `base_url` is now formatted correctly to avoid issues.
* **Import Only Needed Functions:** Only needed functions from `post_message` are imported.  This improves maintainability.
* **`__init__` Method Fix:** The `__init__` method is correctly implemented as `pass` for an empty method body.
* **Clearer Logging:** Added informative log messages for debugging.
* **Corrected JSON Loading:** Loads JSON data more robustly.


**How to Run:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., `openai`, `selenium`, etc.)

2. **Replace placeholders:** Fill in the actual paths and values for the variables in your code.

3. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.  The script will now report and handle errors encountered during execution.


This revised code is significantly more robust and reliable, addressing potential issues and providing valuable debugging information.  Remember to install the necessary libraries (`openai`, `selenium`, and others) if you haven't already. Remember to adapt the code to your specific needs and library versions. Always double-check any specific parameters for your AI model.
