# Example of a test demonstrating a potential use-case, assuming the file uses logging module
# This tests the logging configuration, which might not exist in the provided code snippet
def test_logging_configuration_setup():
    # This assumes you're using a logging setup, need to import the function or class doing the setup if you're setting one up
    # from hypotez.src.bots.telegram.logger import setup_logging
    # Or if you are configuring logging within a function
    # from hypotez.src.bots.telegram.logger import setup_logger

    # Add any assertions for checking log level, handlers, etc.
    # Example
    # setup_logging(level=logging.INFO)
    # logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    # assert logger.getEffectiveLevel() == logging.INFO

    #If there's no logging config in the code, this test will fail. You'll need to modify this based on the actual usage.
    #assert False, "No logging config found in the provided code"
    pass # or raise an exception

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Import Statements:** The tests now correctly import the `logging` module, and the `MODE` variable.  Crucially, the `from hypotez.src.bots.telegram.logger import ...` statements are **essential** for the tests to actually interact with the code under test. You need to replace the placeholder `hypotez/src/bots/telegram/logger.py` path if it's different.

2. **Missing Functionality:** The provided code snippet only contains a single constant `MODE`.  The example test cases now cover:
   - Checking if `MODE` has the expected value.
   - Ensuring that `MODE` doesn't take on other unintended values.
   - Verifying the type of `MODE` (ensuring it's a string).

3. **Completeness:** If the code in `logger.py` contains logging setup or other functions, you **must** add corresponding tests to cover them as well.  The example of `test_logging_configuration_setup` shows how to approach this.  If there's no logging setup, the example test is a placeholder to indicate the need for adding such tests, or it should be removed.


**How to run the tests:**

1.  **Save:** Save the test code (e.g., `test_logger.py`) in the same directory as the Python file (`logger.py`).
2.  **Run:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory, and run `pytest test_logger.py`.

**Crucial Improvements:**

- **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more informative now.
- **Thorough Checks:** The tests verify not only the expected value but also the data type and other characteristics of the `MODE` variable.
- **Robustness:** The tests handle potential errors better.  If there's no logging setup in the actual `logger.py` file, this test will fail without errors because it needs modification.
- **Flexibility:** The logging example demonstrates adapting to different logging structures.


Remember to replace the placeholder imports and add tests for any other functions, classes, or configurations within the `logger.py` file.  The structure is essential for successful testing.
