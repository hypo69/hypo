This is a large database of MIME types and information about them.
It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API.
It aggregates data from the following sources:

- [IANA Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
- [Apache MIME Types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
- [nginx MIME Types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

## Usage

```javascript
const mimeDb = require('mime-db');

// Get data for 'application/javascript'
const jsData = mimeDb['application/javascript'];

console.log(jsData);
// Output: {
//   source: 'iana',
//   extensions: [ 'js' ],
//   ...other properties
// }
```

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased MIME types.
Each MIME type has the following properties:

- `.source`: The source of the MIME type (e.g., `iana`, `apache`, `nginx`, or `custom`).
- `.extensions[]`: An array of file extensions associated with the MIME type.
- `.compressible`: A boolean indicating whether the MIME type is typically compressible.
- `.charset`: The default character set associated with the MIME type.
- `...`: Other properties may be included (e.g., `notes`, `synonyms`).

## Contributing

To add or update entries, primarily modify the `src/custom-types.json` or `src/custom-suffix.json` files.

**src/custom-types.json:**
* This file contains a JSON object where keys are lowercase MIME types.  Each value is an object with properties like `compressible`, `extensions`, `notes`, and `sources` to describe the media type.
*  Ensure to include proper primary source citations for all data.

**src/custom-suffix.json:**
* This file contains the extensions.

Run `npm run build` to update the build.


### Adding Custom MIME Types

The preferred method is to register new MIME types with the IANA.  If that's not feasible, add them as custom types with proper documentation in `src/custom-types.json`.

**Improvements:**

* **Clearer Usage Example:**  Provides a more practical `console.log` example showing how to retrieve and use the data.
* **Improved Documentation Structure:** Organizes information into logical sections.
* **Emphasis on Contributing:** Highlights the `src/custom-types.json` and `src/custom-suffix.json` files for contributing.
* **Correct use of `require`:** Shows how to use the module correctly in the example code.
* **Explicit `compressible` comment:**  Clarifies the boolean usage for `compressible`
* **Removed redundant info:** Removed the unnecessary `MODE = 'debug'` and file header.
* **Removed Browser-Specific Instructions:** This module is primarily for Node.js, so the browser installation instructions are unnecessary.
* **Better grammar and style.**

This revised README is more concise, accurate, and user-friendly. Remember to adapt the example code to your specific use case, and always ensure you cite proper sources when contributing. Remember to cite reliable sources for extensions.
