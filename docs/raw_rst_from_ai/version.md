# hypotez/src/version.py

**File Description:**

This Python file (`version.py`) defines variables containing information about the `hypotez` project, such as its name, version, author, copyright, and a support link (coffee).  It attempts to load project settings from a `settings.json` file, providing fallback values if the file is missing or invalid.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of this file is to centralize and easily access metadata about the project, making it usable by other parts of the application, for example, during documentation generation or displaying project information.


**Code Explanation:**

* **Import `json`:** Imports the necessary library for handling JSON data.

* **`settings: dict = None`:** Declares an empty dictionary to store the project settings loaded from `settings.json`.

* **`try...except` block:** Attempts to open and parse `settings.json`.
    * If `settings.json` is found and its content is valid JSON, the data is loaded into the `settings` dictionary.
    * If `settings.json` is missing or contains invalid JSON, the `except` block is executed (currently a no-op `...`).

* **Project Metadata:** Defines various project attributes (`__project_name__`, `__version__`, etc.) using `settings.get()` to handle potential `settings` being `None`.   This is crucial for robustness.  Crucially, it provides default values if `settings.json` is missing or malformed.

* **Important Note on `__version__`:** The code is missing a handling of bad `version` format in `settings.json`.  If the version is not a string or a format you want to validate, `__version__` will not be usable in an `__init__.py` and should be validated.

* **Default Values:**  Fallback values are set for all metadata attributes, ensuring the script doesn't crash if `settings.json` is missing or corrupted.

**Usage Example (in another Python file):**

```python
from hypotez.src import version

print(version.__project_name__)
print(version.__version__)
```

**`settings.json` Example:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "my_project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyrihgnt": "2024 Your Company",
  "cofee": "Support the developer on Patreon: https://patreon.com/myproject"
}
```

**Potential Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` block should provide more specific error messages for debugging.
* **Version Validation:** Validate the `version` format in `settings.json` to ensure that `__version__` contains a suitable value.
* **Data Validation:** Consider more robust validation of the data in `settings.json` (e.g., using `dataclasses` to define the structure of the settings).
* **`__init__.py`:**  This file should be in the `hypotez` directory and should contain the line `from .src import version`.  This allows you to access the variables directly as `hypotez.version.__project_name__`.  (This is the standard Python way of importing modules).
