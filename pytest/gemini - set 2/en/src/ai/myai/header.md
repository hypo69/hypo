**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Clearer Test Names:** Test names now explicitly indicate the scenario (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_input`).

2.  **Dummy Project Structure:** The tests now create a temporary directory (`test_project_root`) to simulate a project with the marker files. This ensures the tests are isolated and don't interfere with the actual project.  Crucially, it avoids hardcoding file paths that could break on different systems.

3.  **Robust Error Handling:** The original code lacked specific error handling, but now the tests utilize `pytest` for testing `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` (although there are no actual `settings.json` or `README.MD` files in the code you provided).

4. **Edge Cases:** Tests are added to cover cases where the marker file is in a parent directory, or no marker files are found at all.

5. **Cleanup:**  `shutil.rmtree` is used to remove the temporary test directories after each test. This is crucial for keeping the test environment clean.

6. **Correct Path Handling:**  Using `Path` objects throughout the tests to properly handle paths, regardless of the operating system.

7. **`sys.path` handling:**   The test now correctly handles the case where the root directory is already in `sys.path`, and removes the added path to avoid interference with subsequent tests.

8. **Realistic Example:** Demonstrates how to construct and use the absolute path for a file when performing tests, using `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` inside the test function for reliable results across different paths.

**To run these tests:**

1.  Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_header.py`).
2.  Run `pytest test_header.py` from your terminal.

This improved solution is more robust, comprehensive, and addresses potential issues that might arise when running tests. Remember to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pytest packaging
```
