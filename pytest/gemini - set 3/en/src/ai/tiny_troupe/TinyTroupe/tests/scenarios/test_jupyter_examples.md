```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Temporary Directory:** The code now uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`.  This is **critical**.  It creates a temporary directory where the test notebooks are executed.  This prevents tests from accidentally modifying the original notebooks, which is a huge source of problems in automated testing.  It also fixes the issue with `sys.path`.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is improved to provide a more informative error message including the full exception traceback.  This helps significantly in debugging failing tests.

* **Missing Notebook Test:** Added `test_notebook_execution_missing_notebook` to check for the `FileNotFoundError` if the notebook doesn't exist.  This is a crucial edge case.

* **Non-notebook Test:**  Added `test_notebook_execution_non_notebook` to test what happens when a file that is not an ipynb is passed to the function.


* **Temporary Notebook Copying:** Now a copy of the notebook is created inside the temporary directory. This ensures that modifications done by the notebook don't affect the original notebook.

* **Clearer Output:** Improved the output messages to make it easier to see which notebooks are being executed and if they fail.

* **Correct `sys.path`:**  The `sys.path` modifications were incorrect and were likely causing issues. This change should address the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

This revised solution addresses the critical issues of modifying the original files, handling errors more effectively, and ensuring the test runs in a controlled environment. It's now significantly more robust and reliable. Remember to adjust `NOTEBOOK_FOLDER` if your notebook files are located elsewhere.  Finally, make sure the notebooks themselves are valid. This improved set of tests provides better coverage and is much more helpful for debugging any issues that may arise. Remember to install the necessary packages (`nbformat`, `nbconvert`) if you haven't already.  Also, the test cases are now more complete and robust, covering a wider range of scenarios.  Crucially, they now don't modify your original notebooks.
