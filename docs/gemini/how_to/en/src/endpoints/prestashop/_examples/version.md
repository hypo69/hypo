How to use the `version.py` file

This file, `version.py`, appears to be a Python module defining metadata about itself, such as its version number, author, and potentially other details.  It's not a script designed to be run directly, but rather to be imported into other Python code.  The unusual structure with multiple docstrings and comments is intended to document the various attributes.

**Key Information**

The file contains several crucial pieces of information:

* **`__version__`:** This variable stores the version number of the module, which is "3.12.0.0.0.4" in this case.  It's a crucial piece of data for version control, updates, and compatibility checks.
* **`__name__`:**  This variable holds the name of the module. It's important for the `import` statement to find the file.  It will be set as the name of the module when imported.
* **`__doc__`:** This is the module's docstring, describing the purpose and use of the module.
* **`__details__`:** Contains descriptive text about the module or version.
* **`__annotations__`:** This field is empty; it would contain type hints for variables or functions if present.
* **`__author__`:**  Specifies the author of the module, which is "hypotez" in this instance.

**How to use it (in another Python script):**

To use the version information, you'd import the module into another Python file:

```python
import hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version

print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__version__)  # Output: 3.12.0.0.0.4
print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__name__)    # Output: version (or the module name)
print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__author__)   # Output: hypotez
print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__doc__)      # Output: the module docstring (if any)
```


**Important Considerations:**

* **Import Path:** The example above uses the full path to the `version.py` file. In a real-world project, you would likely have a better way to import the module (`__init__.py` files in a package, for example).


* **Docstrings:** The multiple docstrings, while potentially confusing at first glance, help document the module or specific attributes like `MODE`.


* **`MODE` Variable:** The `MODE='dev'` variable likely controls the behavior of the module (e.g., whether it's in development or production mode).  This variable's role depends on the larger project.

* **`__file__`:** (Important!  Often overlooked)  If you need the absolute path to the `version.py` file, you can access it by using `__file__`.

   ```python
   import hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version
   print(hypotez.src.endpoints.prestashop._examples.version.__file__)
   ```


**Best Practices:**

* For organizing larger projects, use Python packages (with `__init__.py` files) and modules to structure your code. This simplifies imports and maintainability significantly.


* Use consistent and meaningful naming conventions for your modules and variables.


*  Follow Python's style guide (PEP 8) for code readability.


This explanation provides context for how to use the `version.py` module and highlights its role in maintaining version information for your project.  Remember to adapt the import path as needed for your specific project structure.
