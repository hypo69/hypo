How to use the header.py file
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This Python script (`hypotez/src/ai/dialogflow/header.py`) defines the root path of a project and initializes various project-related variables.  It handles imports by ensuring that the project's root directory is in the Python path.  It also loads project settings from a JSON file (`settings.json`) and documentation from a Markdown file (`README.MD`). Importantly, it sets critical project variables like the name, version, documentation, author, copyright, and a coffee support link, all based on the contents of `settings.json`.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Import necessary modules:** The script imports `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`, `packaging.version`, and `gs` (likely from another module).

2. **Define `set_project_root` function:** This function takes a tuple of marker file names (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) as an argument.
   - It starts from the current file's directory.
   - It traverses up the directory tree.
   - It checks if any of the marker files exist within each parent directory.
   - If found, it sets the `__root__` variable to that parent directory and breaks the loop.
   - It adds the root directory to the `sys.path` if it's not already present, ensuring that Python can import modules from the project's root.
   - It returns the determined root directory.

3. **Determine the project root:**  The script calls `set_project_root()` to locate the project's root directory. The returned value is stored in the `__root__` variable.

4. **Load project settings (settings.json):** The script attempts to open and parse a `settings.json` file located in the project's `src` directory.
   - If successful, it loads the JSON data into the `settings` variable.
   - If not successful (e.g., file not found or invalid JSON), it handles the exception appropriately (e.g., uses a default value).


5. **Load project documentation (README.MD):** The script attempts to read the content of a `README.MD` file located in the project's `src` directory.
   - If successful, it stores the content in the `doc_str` variable.
   - If not successful (e.g., file not found or other error), it handles the exception appropriately (e.g., sets `doc_str` to an empty string).

6. **Define project variables:** The script assigns values to variables like `__project_name__`, `__version__`, `__doc__`, and more, using the loaded `settings` data or default values if `settings` is unavailable.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Example usage (assuming gs module is defined elsewhere):
    from hypotez.src.ai.dialogflow.header import set_project_root

    root_dir = set_project_root()
    print(f"Project root directory: {root_dir}")
    # ... further code using the project root for imports
