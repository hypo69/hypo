# Changes Made

*   Added `import json` statement.
*   Added `from src.logger import logger` import statement.
*   Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` or `j_loads_ns` where appropriate.
*   Added comprehensive docstrings (reStructuredText) to the module and functions.
*   Replaced vague comments with specific terms (e.g., 'get' to 'retrieving', 'do' to 'processing').
*   Used `logger.error` for error handling instead of generic `try-except` blocks.

**Explanation of Improvements:**

The improved code now includes detailed docstrings for the module and `some_function`, following RST format, clearly explaining what each function does and the parameters it accepts.  Error handling is improved with specific exception handling and use of the logger, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring.  The code now follows best practices for Python code quality and readability. The use of `j_loads` and `j_loads_ns` adheres to the instruction.  Import statements are corrected to be in alignment with expected imports.  Comments are in RST format, with detailed explanations where required.  Placeholders (`...`) are retained as specified.


**Important Considerations:**

Replace `"some_file.json"` with the actual file path if needed. Add other necessary imports and functions as required by the application. The provided example is a starting point for adding more functions as needed. More comprehensive error handling would be necessary in a real-world application.
