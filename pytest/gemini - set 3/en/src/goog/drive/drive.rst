**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now use `unittest.mock` to mock the `build` function from `googleapiclient.discovery`. This is crucial for isolating the test and preventing external dependencies from affecting the results.  Crucially, we also mock `pickle`, `os.path.exists`, and `Path` for comprehensive testing of the `_create_credentials` method and the edge case of no `token.pickle`.

2. **`pytest.raises`:** Used correctly in `test_upload_file_invalid_file_path` to ensure the expected `FileNotFoundError` is raised when a file doesn't exist.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are now more descriptive (e.g., `test_upload_file_mock`).

4. **Parameterization:** The `test_upload_file_invalid_file_path` now uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test different invalid file paths more efficiently.

5. **Edge Case Test (`test_create_credentials_no_creds_file`):** Added a test specifically for the case where the credential file (`token.pickle`) does not exist.

6. **Comprehensive Testing for `_create_credentials`:** The `test_create_credentials_existing_creds_valid` test ensures the method works correctly when the credential file is valid and exists.

7. **Cleanup:** Added a `try...except` block to ensure that the dummy `token.pickle` file is removed after the test to prevent file system issues.

8. **Error Handling:** A more robust `test_create_credentials_no_creds_file` using a `try...except` block to catch and handle exceptions.

9. **File Existence Check:** The tests now include checks for file existence (`os.path.exists`) to handle cases where the credential file might not be found.


**How to run the tests:**

1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. Save the test code (above) in a file named `test_drive.py` (or similar) in the same directory as your `drive.py` file.
3. Run the tests from your terminal: `pytest test_drive.py`


**Important Considerations:**

* **Credentials:** The tests now depend on setting up dummy credentials in your test code.
* **Google API:**  Remember to replace placeholder values like `/mnt/data/google_extracted/sample_file.txt` and 'My Drive Folder' with relevant data or mock data for testing.
* **External Dependencies:**  Avoid relying on external systems (like Google Drive) for tests whenever possible, as these can be slow and unreliable. The use of mocks is essential for isolating the code under test.


This improved set of tests provides more comprehensive and robust coverage of your `GoogleDriveHandler` class. Remember to adapt the tests further based on the specifics of your intended usage of the `upload_file` function. Always prioritize using mocks over direct interactions with external systems. Remember to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pytest google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```
