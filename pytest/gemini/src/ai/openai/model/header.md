**Explanation and Improvements:**

1.  **Clearer Test Names:**  Test names now explicitly indicate the scenario (e.g., `test_set_project_root_valid_path`).

2.  **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests now cover cases with marker files in different locations and no marker files found.  Crucially, tests for `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` are included.

3.  **Mocking:** The `test_load_settings_success` test uses `patch` to mock file existence and contents, making it more robust and independent of the real file system. This is vital for testing the error handling.

4.  **`tmp_path` Fixture:** Uses `tmp_path` from pytest to create temporary files for testing, avoiding interference with the actual project files.

5. **Edge Case:** Added a test for an empty tuple of marker files.

6. **Correct Error Handling:** `pytest.raises` is used correctly to assert that the expected exceptions are raised.

7. **Isolated Tests:** All tests are independent and don't rely on the state of other tests.

8. **File Existence Checks**: Instead of relying on `exists()`, check the return value of `Path.glob()` for realistic testing.

This improved solution provides more comprehensive test cases that verify the different conditions and error handling of the `set_project_root` function.  Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`# ...`) with actual assertions where appropriate if the expected behavior is known. Remember to install `pytest` and `packaging` if you haven't already.  Make sure that `gs` and any other external dependencies in the file are appropriately mocked or available.
