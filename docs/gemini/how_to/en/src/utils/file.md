**Key Improvements and Explanation:**

* **Crucial newline fix in `save_text_file`:** The line `file.writelines(f"{line}\n" for line in data)` now properly appends a newline character (`\n`) to each line in the list, preventing issues with concatenated output in `save_text_file`.

* **Empty patterns handling in `recursively_read_text_files`:** Added a crucial check:
```python
    if not patterns:
        return matches
```
This prevents an error if the `patterns` list is empty, which would have caused an error later in the loop.

* **Clearer error handling in `recursively_read_text_files`:** The check for the existence and type of the `root_path` was greatly improved by adding a check if `root_path` is a directory and logging an appropriate message if it's not.

* **`rstrip('\r\n')` for line handling:**  Added `.rstrip('\r\n')` to the lines in the `if as_list` block of `recursively_read_text_files`.  This is **very important** because files on Windows often have both \r and \n characters.  This removes both, ensuring consistent line endings in the output.


These changes address potential issues and make the code more robust and reliable. Remember to adjust imports if necessary in your project.  Always test thoroughly after implementing any code changes.
