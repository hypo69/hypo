How to use the `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` module

This module, `hypotez/src/logger/header.py`, defines the root path of the Hypotez project and initializes several project-level variables.  It's crucial for ensuring that imports work correctly across different parts of the project.

**Functionality:**

1. **`set_project_root(marker_files=...)`:** This function is the core of the module.  It locates the project root directory.

   - **Input:** A tuple of file/directory names (`marker_files`).  The function searches for these markers starting from the current file's location and moving up the directory tree.  Common choices include `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `.git`.  Default values are provided for these.  **Crucially, if these files are not present in your project hierarchy, the script will likely fail.**

   - **Output:** A `pathlib.Path` object representing the project root directory.  Importantly, it also adds this path to `sys.path`, ensuring that Python can find the necessary modules within the project.

2. **Project Information Loading:** The script loads project settings from a `settings.json` file located in the `src/` directory relative to the project root.  It also attempts to load the content of `README.MD` and use it as a project description.  Any exceptions during loading are handled gracefully with `...`.


3. **Setting Project Variables:** After potentially loading `settings.json`, the module populates several important variables:

   - `__root__`: The project root directory path, set by the `set_project_root` function.
   - `__project_name__`:  Retrieved from `settings.json`. Defaults to 'hypotez' if not found.
   - `__version__`:  Retrieved from `settings.json`. Defaults to an empty string if not found.
   - `__doc__`: The content of `README.MD`, if it exists. Defaults to an empty string otherwise.
   - `__details__`:  Currently an empty string.
   - `__author__`: Retrieved from `settings.json`. Defaults to an empty string if not found.
   - `__copyright__`: Retrieved from `settings.json`. Defaults to an empty string if not found.
   - `__cofee__`: Retrieved from `settings.json`. Defaults to a specific URL if not found.  This suggests a developer outreach effort.

**How to Use:**

1. **Place the `header.py` file:** Save this code as `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` (adjust paths as needed).
2. **Create `settings.json` (optional but recommended):**  Create a `settings.json` file within your project's `src` folder. This file should contain JSON representing your project metadata.
3. **Ensure `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `.git` Exist:** At least one of these files (or equivalent markers) needs to exist at the level where you are invoking `set_project_root` otherwise the function will fail.  This is why the `marker_files` argument in the `set_project_root` function is so important.


4. **Import and Use:** In your other Python files within the project, you can import and use the variables defined in `hypotez/src/logger/header.py` (e.g., `__root__`, `__project_name__`, etc.).  **Import them relative to the project root.**  This module is designed for use as the top-level entry point of the project or within sub-modules within the project tree.  You would not, typically, directly use this script in your application.  The settings and versioning are the intended result of running this script.


**Example Usage (in another Python file):**

```python
import sys
from hypotez.src.logger.header import __root__, __project_name__, __version__

print(f"Project Root: {__root__}")
print(f"Project Name: {__project_name__}")
print(f"Project Version: {__version__}")
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks for loading `settings.json` and `README.MD` are good practice but should be expanded to more specifically deal with particular issues.
- **Relative Imports:** Pay close attention to relative imports (`from src import gs`). They're designed to work properly only if your files are structured under the project root.
- **File Existence:** Ensure the `settings.json` and `README.MD` files exist in the expected location.  The function `set_project_root` is crucial to ensure the path resolution is correct.
