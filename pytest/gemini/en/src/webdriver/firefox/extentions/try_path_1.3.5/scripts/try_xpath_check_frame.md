```python

# No Python code to test, only JavaScript code is provided.
# Therefore, no tests can be written.  A test suite cannot be created
# from JavaScript code alone.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

The provided JavaScript code (`try_xpath_check_frame.js`) does *not* contain any Python code.  Therefore, there's nothing to test with `pytest`.  The prompt asks for Python tests, and there's no Python to be found.

To create useful tests, you need the Python code that interacts with the JavaScript code (e.g., using Selenium or other WebDriver libraries).  This Python code would define the functions, classes, and methods that the JavaScript code is intended to support.  Only *then* can you write meaningful `pytest` tests to ensure correct behavior.

For example, if you had a Python function like this:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
# ... other imports ...

def check_content_loaded(driver, frame_id):
    # ... (Code to interact with the JavaScript code,
    #     e.g., using JavaScriptExecutor to call tryxpath.isContentLoaded
    #     within a specific frame) ...
    return tryxpath.isContentLoaded # Or whatever function from tryxpath

```

*Then* you could write `pytest` tests to verify `check_content_loaded`'s behavior given different inputs and conditions.  These tests would be based on interacting with the browser and the JavaScript.  You would need to use the WebDriver to set up the browser, load the page, and simulate interactions with the JavaScript function (`tryxpath.isContentLoaded`).

In short: The JavaScript code alone is insufficient for creating `pytest` tests. You need the associated Python code. Please provide the relevant Python code for a useful test suite.
