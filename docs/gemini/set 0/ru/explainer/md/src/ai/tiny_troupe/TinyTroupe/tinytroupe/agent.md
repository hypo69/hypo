"""
This module provides the main classes and functions for TinyTroupe's  agents.

Agents are the key abstraction used in TinyTroupe. An agent is a simulated person or entity that can interact with other agents and the environment, by
receiving stimuli and producing actions. Agents have cognitive states, which are updated as they interact with the environment and other agents. 
Agents can also store and retrieve information from memory, and can perform actions in the environment. Different from agents whose objective is to
provide support for AI-based assistants or other such productivity tools, **TinyTroupe agents are aim at representing human-like behavior**, which includes
idiossincracies, emotions, and other human-like traits, that one would not expect from a productivity tool.

The overall underlying design is inspired mainly by cognitive psychology, which is why agents have various internal cognitive states, such as attention, emotions, and goals.
It is also why agent memory, differently from other LLM-based agent platforms, has subtle internal divisions, notably between episodic and semantic memory. 
Some behaviorist concepts are also present, such as the idea of a "stimulus" and "response" in the `listen` and `act` methods, which are key abstractions
to understand how agents interact with the environment and other agents.

# <algorithm>

The algorithm is complex, but focuses on creating and managing agents with various cognitive states and interactions.  A key aspect is the interaction with external tools (like OpenAI) and internal memory management.

**1. Initialization:**
   - Reads configuration from a file (`utils.read_config_file()`).  Example: reading `embedding_model`.
   - Sets up LLaMa-Index embedding model. Example: setting `Settings.embed_model`.
   - Initializes `TinyPerson` object with name, episodic and semantic memory, and mental faculties.
   - Populates `_configuration` dictionary with default values (name, age, etc.).
   - Loads initial prompt template.
   - Registers the agent (`TinyPerson.add_agent()`).
   - Resets agent prompt (`reset_prompt()`).
   - Sets simulation id if within a simulation context (`current_simulation()`).


**2. Interaction Methods (listen, act, etc.):**
   - `listen`: Stores the input (`speech`) in `episodic_memory` and triggers internal cognitive processing.
   - `act`:
     - Iterates (until done or a fixed number of actions) to produce a message using OpenAI API (`openai_utils.client().send_message()`).
     - Stores the result (`action`) in the `episodic_memory`.
     - Updates the cognitive state (`_update_cognitive_state()`).
     - Processes the action with the mental faculties.
     - Displays output using `_display_communication()`.


**3. Configuration Management (define, define_several, define_relationships):**
   - `define`: Modifies the agent's internal configuration (`_configuration`). Example: updates agent's age.
   - `define_several`: Updates multiple entries in the configuration, often for bulk updates related to the same group, like relationships.
   - `define_relationships`: Creates or modifies agent relationships (e.g., friends, colleagues).


**4. Agent Interactions:**
   - `related_to`: Defines a relationship between agents. Both agents' `_configuration` are updated.
   - `add_mental_faculty`, `add_mental_faculties`: Allows adding new mental faculties to the agent.
   - `move_to`, `change_context`: Updates agent's current location and context, affecting further interaction and memory retrieval.
   - `make_agent_accessible`, `make_agent_inaccessible`: Dynamically manage interactions with other agents within the simulation.

**5. Memory Management:**
   - `EpisodicMemory`, `SemanticMemory`: Handle the storage and retrieval of different types of memory information. `EpisodicMemory` keeps recent interactions while `SemanticMemory` stores and retrieves knowledge (through llama-index) from documents.


**Data Flow:**  Input (`speech`) -> `listen` -> `episodic_memory` -> `_produce_message` (OpenAI API) -> `_update_cognitive_state` -> `_configuration` -> `act` -> `episodic_memory` -> output. Data is stored in memory and passed through various methods to update the agent's state.

- `utils.read_config_file()`: Reads TinyTroupe's configuration file.
- `utils.extract_json()`: Parses JSON from a string.
- `post_init`: Decorator, ensuring `_post_init` is called after `__init__`.

**Variables:**

- `config`, `default`: Configuration dictionaries (both read from config file and providing defaults).
- `llmaindex_openai_embed_model`:  The LLaMa-Index embedding model (OpenAI-based).
- `Settings.embed_model`:  Global variable setting the embedding model to use.


**Possible Improvements/Errors:**

- Error handling in `_produce_message` could be improved with more specific error types and recovery Startegies.
- The `retrieve_relevant` method in `SemanticMemory` lacks a concrete implementation of relevance.
-  The code would benefit from a clear separation of concerns. Some sections (e.g. formatting) could be moved to separate modules for better organization.
-   Clearer documentation for the various actions is needed, or a glossary of actions used to interact with the world should be created for developers.
-   Extensive logging is a good idea to keep track of interactions, but should be properly adjusted in production or real world scenarios in order to not clog the system with unnecessary debugging information.



**Relationships with other parts of the project:**

The code heavily relies on `tinytroupe.utils` for utilities and `tinytroupe.control` for simulation management and other external tools, such as the OpenAI API.  The `EpisodicMemory` and `SemanticMemory` classes and their respective subclasses are central for the cognitive state management.


This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the code, but a more in-depth understanding would require examining the related classes and functions within the `tinytroupe` module and its dependencies (such as `EpisodicMemory`, `SemanticMemory`, etc).
