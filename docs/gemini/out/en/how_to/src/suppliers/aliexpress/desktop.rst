How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block represents a Windows `desktop.ini` file fragment.  It defines metadata for a folder, likely for visual customization within Windows Explorer.  The `ViewState` section stores settings that determine how the folder appears to the user, such as its layout and the presence of a logo.

Execution steps
-------------------------
1. **Mode**: This field (currently empty) likely controls display mode. Possible values affect how the folder contents are presented (e.g., icon view, list view).

2. **Vid**: This field (currently empty) likely refers to the folder's view ID.  This is a unique identifier associated with a specific view configuration.

3. **FolderType**: This field, set to "Generic", indicates the type of folder being described, in this case, it's not a special type of folder.

4. **Logo**: This field defines the path to a logo file for the folder. The current value specifies an image file (R.png) located in the `E:\\Users\\user\\images\\LOGOS` directory.  This tells Windows Explorer to display this image as the folder icon.

Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: ini

    [ViewState]
    Mode=Icon
    Vid=MyCustomViewID
