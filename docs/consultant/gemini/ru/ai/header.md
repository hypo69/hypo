```

**Changes Made**:

- Added type hints (`Tuple[str, ...]`, `pathlib.Path`) for `get_project_root` function and variables.
- Replaced `json.load` with `j_loads` from `src.utils.jjson` for safer JSON loading. This is crucial for handling potential errors and security issues.
- Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError` when loading `settings.json` and `README.MD`.  This prevents the script from crashing if the files are missing or have invalid content.  Prints informative messages to the console.
- Removed unnecessary `if settings` checks.  If `settings` is `None` or empty, the defaults will be used.
- Improved clarity and consistency of comments using reStructuredText (RST) format.
- Corrected the spelling error in `copyrihgnt` to `copyright`.
- Improved error handling and logging by printing informative messages if files are not found or the JSON is invalid.
- Added a more descriptive docstring for `get_project_root`.
- Fixed `__root__` variable assignment to be consistent with the return type.


This revised code is more robust, handles potential errors gracefully, and adheres to the specified requirements.  It's also more readable due to better comments and type hints. Remember to install `pydantic` if you want to use that, and to ensure `src.utils.jjson` module is present and works correctly. Also you need to replace `jjson` function to something that handles JSON data.
