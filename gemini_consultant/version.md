```

**Improvements and explanations:**

* **`__copyright__` typo fixed:**  Corrected the typo "copyrihgnt" to "copyright".
* **Error Handling and Clarity:** The `try...except` block now prints a helpful message if `settings.json` is missing or corrupt. This is crucial for debugging.  The `if settings` check is still important to prevent errors when `settings` is `None`.
* **PEP 8 Compliance:** Added spaces around operators (`if settings else`) for better readability.  This is a Python style guide recommendation.
* **Variable Assignment:**  Using `__version__ = ...` is the standard way to assign to a variable in Python, rather than using a colon after the variable name.
* **`settings: dict = None`:** This explicit type hinting is a good practice.

**How to use:**

This `version.py` module now sets up variables like `__version__`, `__project_name__`, etc.  You can access these values in other parts of your project using these variable names directly:


```python
import version

print(version.__version__)
print(version.__project_name__)
```

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "copyright": "2024, Your Company"
}
```

This improved version is more robust, readable, and follows Python best practices.  It's essential to have a `settings.json` file for this code to function correctly.  If it's missing, the default values are used, and a warning is printed. Remember to replace placeholders like "My Awesome Project" with your project's details.
