**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:** The tests now effectively mock the `s.driver` and `s.locators` using `unittest.mock`. This is crucial because the original code interacts with a webdriver (presumably Selenium).  Mocking allows us to control the input and the output from the driver, making the tests independent and fast.

2. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, indicating the input scenario.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The tests now cover edge cases like empty locators, locators returning `None`, and even the case where the locator returns an empty list, which was a potential failure point.

4. **Error Handling:** Tests explicitly check for `None` or empty results, ensuring the function gracefully handles these situations.

5. **Assertions:** Assertions are more targeted, confirming expected behavior (e.g., `assert products_urls is None`).

6. **Explicit `assert_called_once()`:** This now verifies that the `s.driver.scroll()` method is called only once as expected.

7. **Realistic Mocking:**  The mocking of `execute_locator` is now more accurate; it returns the input if it's a list, which matches the expected logic of the function.

8. **No Unnecessary Imports:** Removed unnecessary imports.

This revised test suite is significantly more robust and accurately reflects the expected behavior of the function in various scenarios. Remember to install the `pytest` and `unittest` libraries.  Run the tests using `pytest`. Remember to adapt these tests if the `s` object or locators have a different structure in your actual code.
