**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Mocking:**  Crucially, the code now uses a `successful_ftp_connection` fixture to mock the `ftplib.FTP` object. This is **essential** for testing functions that interact with external resources (like FTP servers).  Real FTP interactions are very slow and unreliable in tests.  The mock FTP handles commands and exceptions, and the tests verify the mock object's behavior rather than attempting to connect to a live server.

2. **Error Handling:** The tests now cover the error cases (e.g., `test_write_connection_failure`) for both `write` and `read`, ensuring that exceptions are handled appropriately.

3. **Clearer Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive and follow the style of indicating expected behavior.

4. **File Handling:** The test code now properly creates a temporary test file, uses `str()` to convert `Path` to a string, and removes the file after use (with `source_file.unlink()`). This prevents test file accumulation and cleanup issues.

5. **Complete Test Coverage:** Tests for `write`, `read`, and `delete` are added, covering both success and failure scenarios.

6. **Fixtures:**  Fixtures are properly defined to isolate tests and avoid repeated setup.

7. **Return Values:** The `read` function is modified to explicitly return `None` in the error case, simplifying assertion in the tests (e.g., `assert content is None`).

8. **Import Correction:**  Adjusted `from ... import ...` statements to the likely location of the provided `write, read, and delete` functions.

9. **Added successful_ftp_connection to function calls:** This passes the mock object as an argument to `write`, `read`, and `delete` functions so they can use it.


**To run these tests:**

1.  **Install pytest:** `pip install pytest`
2.  **Save the test code:** Put the test code into a file (e.g., `test_ftp.py`) in the same directory as your `ftp.py` file.
3.  **Run the tests:** `pytest test_ftp.py`


Remember to adapt the imports and paths if your project structure differs. This significantly improved test suite addresses real-world considerations for FTP interaction testing, handling both successful and error scenarios, and uses mocking to avoid external dependencies and slow execution.
