How to use this code block
=========================================================================================

Description
-------------------------
This code block contains Python module-level constants and docstrings.  It appears to be part of a larger Ivory supplier module for a hypothetical system. The code defines a constant `MODE` with a value of 'dev'.  There are also numerous empty string docstrings, likely placeholders for future documentation of functions or classes that will be added later in the file.  Crucially, the code is specifying its intended operating systems (Windows and Unix) and is setting up a development environment with Python 3.12.


Execution steps
-------------------------
1. The file `login.py` is designed to be a Python module.
2. It defines a constant `MODE` with the value `'dev'`.
3. The code utilizes docstrings (`"""..."""`) to document its purpose and intended platforms. These docstrings are commented out and appear to be placeholders.
4. It includes multiple blank docstring comments, indicating that this file is likely a template for a larger supplier module.
5. The code sets up interpreter parameters via `` and `#! venv/bin/python/python3.12`.  This tells the operating system which Python interpreter to use when executing the file.


Usage example
-------------------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Import the module (assuming the file is saved as login.py)
    import hypotez.src.suppliers.ivory.login as login

    # Access the MODE constant
    print(login.MODE)  # Output: dev
